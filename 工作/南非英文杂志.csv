za,Sunday Tribune,20170507,Bid to fight poverty and boo,"THE World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) for Africa, held in Dur­ban this week, was con­vened to dis­cuss ways to erad­i­cate poverty and pro­mote shared growth and op­por­tu­ni­ties for all Africans. In this con­text, Wildu du Plessis, part­ner and Africa head at Baker Mcken­zie law firm in Jo­han­nes­burg, said at the event that it was im­por­tant to note that the fun­da­men­tals of the global econ­omy had shifted and in­vestors were now look­ing to de­vel­op­ing economies for higher rates of re­turn as de­vel­oped na­tions had be­come low-growth economies. He said that although China, Brazil and In­dia had re­ceived much of the spot­light, China was turn­ing into a de­vel­oped econ­omy while Brazil and In­dia faced ma­jor struc­tural is­sues to de­liver on their po­ten­tial. This meant Africa, de­spite its own chal­lenges, was defini­tively the last fron­tier for cap­i­tal­ist op­por­tu­ni­ties. Du Plessis sug­gested that de­spite its im­per­fec­tions, cap­i­tal­ism had lifted bil­lions of peo­ple out of sub­sis­tence poverty in the past three decades. “Cap­i­tal­ism de­liv­ers good things when al­lowed to func­tion as it should,” he said. Du Plessis said gov­ern­ments and leg­is­la­tors in African na­tions should act as en­ablers ap­ply­ing the ba­sic prin­ci­ples of cap­i­tal­ism such as free mar­ket com­pe­ti­tion, pri­vate own­er­ship and cap­i­tal in­vest­ment for returns. “Treat cap­i­tal­ism as an eco­nomic sys­tem that has been em­pir­i­cally proven to work and ev­ery­one will ben­e­fit through the emer­gence of a large and more af­flu­ent mid­dle class. “How­ever, when it is twisted into so-called ‘crony cap­i­tal­ism’, only the elite ben­e­fit and the con­cept is mis­un­der­stood and vil­i­fied,” he said. Du Plessis said colo­nial­ists had set the tone for this in Africa. “While Bri­tain and oth­ers were em­brac­ing free trade, in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, lib­er­al­ism, com­pe­ti­tion and the de­vel­op­ment of a mar­ket econ­omy, the story in Africa was of con­quest by Euro­pean na­tions and the hand­ing of de facto mo­nop­o­lies to pow­er­ful in­di­vid­u­als to ex­tract valu­able nat­u­ral re­sources. “This ben­e­fited small elites rather than the col­lec­tive in­ter­ests, cre­at­ing an in­ac­cu­rate view among many gov­ern­ments of what cap­i­tal­ism is and the vast ben­e­fits it can de­liver to the many, not just the few,” said du Plessis. “More re­cently, the com­bi­na­tion of Africa’s fer­tile land, abun­dance of nat­u­ral re­sources, and gov­ern­ments that hoped to ben­e­fit from for­eign in­vest­ment, but with­out the tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise to re­tain and direct the ben­e­fits of such in­vest­ment, had made the con­ti­nent an easy tar­get for ex­ploita­tion by un­scrupu­lous in­vestors and politi­cians. “This leaves the con­ti­nent in a strange hin­ter­land be­tween de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­nity and cri­sis. This is, of course, a gross gen­er­al­i­sa­tion – many coun­tries have made enor­mous progress,” he said. Du Plessis said the ma­jor­ity of to­day’s African lead­ers wanted the best for their peo­ple, while in­vestors wanted to stake claims ramp up their in­vest­ments if they are con­fi­dent no gov­ern­ment can sim­ply take away their as­sets on a whim. 2 Co-op­er­a­tion. The emer­gence of nascent trad­ing blocs such as the East AU for ex­am­ple. As parts of the world seem to be frag­ment­ing (for ex­am­ple, Brexit and the EU) or turn­ing in­ward (the US), there is an op­por­tu­nity for African na­tions to col­lab­o­rate. Speak­ing with one voice means a strong hand in trade ne­go­ti­a­tions. 3 En­ergy and in­fras­truc­ture, in Africa and for Africa. It is the same old is­sue but it is an un­avoid­able fact that Africa can­not reach its po­ten­tial with­out more and bet­ter en­ergy and in­fras­truc­ture. “To fully lever­age the con­ti­nent’s wealth po­ten­tial, le­gal struc­tures need to be put in place to guide Africa’s de­vel­op­ment agenda from within by en­abling en­trepreneur­ship, cut­ting red tape and bu­reau­cracy, sup­port­ing suc­cess and sell­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to the wider world of for­eign in­vestors. “The world is mov­ing in­creas­ingly to­wards mixed mod­els of cap­i­tal­ism and what is cer­tain is that Africa needs one that both caters for its unique ad­van­tages and ad­dresses its equally unique chal­lenges.",南非
za,Cape Times,20140806,Broader vi­sion,"EVEN as the Ebola virus serves as a re­minder of Africa’s man­i­fold chal­lenges, a much brighter fu­ture for the con­ti­nent was on dis­play this week in Wash­ing­ton, where more than 40 African heads of state are at­tend­ing a sum­mit meet­ing led by US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama. Done right, with suf­fi­cient fol­low-through, the event should strengthen Amer­i­can ties to a con­ti­nent that is ex­pected to out­pace China and In­dia in pop­u­la­tion by 2040 and is widely viewed as the world’s last ma­jor eco­nomic fron­tier. The event is a de­ter­mined, and splashy, ini­tia­tive by Obama to push back against other coun­tries do­ing busi­ness there, es­pe­cially China, which is in­vest­ing heav­ily in in­fra­struc­ture projects and us­ing Africa as a source of vi­tal oil and met­als. It is also an op­por­tu­nity to counter crit­ics who say he has de­voted in­suf­fi­cient at­ten­tion to the con­ti­nent. Ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have been ea­ger to per­suade Africa that Amer­ica’s demo­cratic cap­i­tal­is­tic sys­tem can of­fer ad­van­tages that China’s au­thor­i­tar­ian sys­tem can­not. As Su­san Rice, the na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser, said last week: “We don’t see Africa as a pipe­line to ex­tract vi­tal re­sources, nor as a fun­nel for char­ity.” She de­scribed a broader vi­sion in which the US was com­mit­ted to be­ing a part­ner to create jobs, re­solve con­flicts and de­velop the hu­man cap­i­tal needed to build a bet­ter fu­ture. The world has largely as­so­ci­ated Africa with des­per­ate strug­gles against war, poverty, famine and dic­ta­to­rial lead­ers. But there are pos­i­tive trends, too. Africa is home to six of the 10 fastest-grow­ing economies in the world, an emerg­ing mid­dle class and mar­kets that are in­creas­ingly open to for­eign in­vest­ment. In short, there is money to be made there. There is also a grow­ing threat from mil­i­tants in some coun­tries. And, as hu­man rights groups point out, the sum­mit meet­ing’s fo­cus on trade, in­vest­ment and counter-ter­ror­ism can­not be al­lowed to di­lute the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s will­ing­ness to press for good and hon­est gov­er­nance, fair elec­tions and hu­man rights, all es­sen­tial for long-term sta­bil­ity and growth.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20180823,‘We are not here to colonise Africa’,"CHI­NESE am­bas­sador to South Africa Lin Song­tian says China has no in­ten­tions of ex­ploit­ing Africa for its re­sources. “Yes, we do a lot on this con­ti­nent and we get a lot (in re­turn). The most im­por­tant fac­tor is that we get and give sup­port in all we do,” he said, adding the Asian coun­try’s re­la­tion­ship with South Africa and the rest of con­ti­nent was a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial one. Song­tian’s re­marks come amid con­tin­u­ous ques­tions over China’s vested in­ter­est in Africa and what it ex­pects in re­turn. Last month, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping signed 10 agree­ments with Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa dur­ing the 10th BRICS Sum­mit held in Sand­ton. The agree­ments in­clude a $14.7 bil­lion (R210bn) in­vest­ment geared to­wards eco­nomic growth and de­vel­op­ment in the coun­try. China, which is South Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner and the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world, has also in­vested sig­nif­i­cantly in other parts of Africa by means of in­creas­ing in­fra­struc­ture and cre­at­ing job op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­duce poverty. And now, as the con­ti­nent’s lead­ers pre­pare to at­tend the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) sum­mit in Bei­jing next month, Song­tian high­lighted that his coun­try was more con­cerned about pro­duc­ing tan­gi­ble re­sults that would lead to a pros­per­ous Africa rather than mak­ing empty prom­ises. “China is a new­comer. Re­sources have (in the past) been ex­ploited and con­trolled by the West. Check the record of the West and what they have done. China will never re­peat the ac­tions of the colo­nial way (era). We won’t come here to ex­ploit and run away,” he said. He ex­plained that in places where China sought to ob­tain min­eral re­sources, it en­sured that the in­ter­ests of the peo­ple of those coun­tries were placed first. Song­tian also re­flected on the BRICS Sum­mit, say­ing the gath­er­ing was highly suc­cess­ful, as seen in the var­i­ous achieve­ments ob­tained, such as the adop­tion of poli­cies around the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion and the sign­ing of a visa agree­ment between South Africa and the Asian coun­try. He also lauded the strong mes­sage that had been sent out by the BRICS coun­tries against the ris­ing wave of pro­tec­tion­ism, uni­lat­er­al­ism and ex­treme in­di­vid­u­al­ism, say­ing: “BRICS have come to­gether to fight for a fair and just in­ter­na­tional or­der and to up­hold the rule­based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing regime.” Asked what his sen­ti­ments were on the in­creas­ing trade ten­sions between China and the US, Song­tian replied that it was un­for­tu­nate that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had changed the rules of en­gage­ment at the ex­pense of emerg­ing economies. He said that in 1980, Amer­ica had forced China to take up free trade, but was now chang­ing its tune. “They now suf­fer from their rules. Our (world) leader (re­fer­ring to Trump) has changed the rules. The trade war has sig­nif­i­cantly af­fected trade, and ev­ery­body is pay­ing the price.” Song­tian added: “What the US is try­ing to achieve is not only Amer­i­can first, but Amer­i­can only... Emerg­ing economies must stand to­gether to say no to any bul­ly­ing pol­icy against a free-trade regime... there is no win­ner in a trade war.” Speak­ing on Zim­babwe and the pres­i­den­tial poll re­sults stale­mate, Song­tian said China would wel­come any leader cho­sen by the masses. “We don’t see in­di­vid­ual re­la­tions but na­tional re­la­tions. We al­ways pre­fer the choice of the peo­ple. When the court has made its de­ci­sion, the (le­git­i­mate) pres­i­dent will be in China (for FOCAC),” he said. On Chi­nese nationals ac­cused and ar­rested for rhino poach­ing, Song­tian re­it­er­ated that his coun­try had no room for those who break the law.",南非
za,Cape Times,20201105,State of world fight against TB,"THE Global Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Re­port (GTR) 2020, pub­lished last month by the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO), is a sober­ing re­minder of the war against a deadly pathogen, which re­mains one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. TB has plagued the world for cen­turies, with 10 mil­lion peo­ple con­tract­ing the dis­ease last year. De­spite its con­tain­ment, the drug-re­sis­tant vari­ant of the dis­ease con­tin­ues to resur­face. The Covid-19 pan­demic has im­pacted on the fight against TB as re­sources are di­verted and de­tec­tions de­crease, typ­i­cally trig­gered by na­tional lock­downs. Restor­ing TB de­tec­tion and care ser­vices is slow and incomplete. South Africa is among the High Bur­den TB coun­tries. Al­though drug-re­sis­tant TB is not in­creas­ing in South Africa, the num­ber of over­all cases has in­creased year on year. In­equal­i­ties in wealth and ac­cess to health care are ag­gra­vated in the ab­sence of ef­fec­tive mit­i­ga­tion poli­cies. In an exclusive in­ter­view, Dr Tereza Kasaeva, the direc­tor of the Global TB Pro­gramme, spoke about the state of the fight against TB, the im­pact of Covid-19, the wis­dom of set­ting global tar­gets, the spec­tre of drug-re­sis­tant vari­ants, the chal­lenges of health in­equal­ity and the pri­or­i­ties of the WHO in mit­i­gat­ing TB in the com­ing years. Mush­tak Parker: GTR 2020 is a very sober doc­u­ment about the com­plex­i­ties, con­tain­ment and the medium-term chal­lenges in the fight against a “very pre­ventable and cur­able dis­ease”. What is the com­pelling story of this fight against TB and how do we main­tain the gains made de­spite the ad­ver­sity? Dr Tereza Kasaeva: TB re­mains the world’s top in­fec­tious killer, claim­ing close to 4 000 lives a day, and 1.4 mil­lion lives an­nu­ally. It is the leading killer of peo­ple with HIV and a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor of an­timi­cro­bial re­sis­tance-re­lated deaths. Ten mil­lion peo­ple fell ill with TB world­wide last year, in­clud­ing 5.6 mil­lion men, 3.2 mil­lion women and 1.2 mil­lion chil­dren. Among all those af­fected, 8.2% were peo­ple liv­ing with HIV. This pre­ventable and cur­able dis­ease places an enor­mous hu­man and so­ci­etal toll on those af­fected, their fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties. To ac­cel­er­ate the re­sponse to end TB, two years ago, heads of state and other world lead­ers gath­ered for the first UN High Level Meet­ing on Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and made bold com­mit­ments, that have of­fered hope for end­ing the death and suf­fer­ing of mil­lions world­wide from TB. This year marks a mid­point of ef­forts to ac­cel­er­ate the TB re­sponse to reach the 2022 tar­gets promised in the UN High Level meet­ing dec­la­ra­tion. GTR 2020 show­cases global, re­gional and coun­try progress, while high­light­ing that much re­mains to be done to reach the TB tar­gets set in the WHO End TB Strat­egy, the UN Sus­tain­able Development Goals (SDGs) and the dec­la­ra­tion of the UN high-level meet­ing on TB. It also ex­pands on the UN Sec­re­tary-General’s 2020 progress re­port on TB. The Covid-19 pan­demic fur­ther threat­ens to re­verse gains. There has been sig­nif­i­cant im­pact with the work done to date in reach­ing and pro­vid­ing preven­tion and care to peo­ple with TB. In GTR, the WHO is an­nounc­ing that around 63 mil­lion lives have been saved since the year 2000. There was a 9% re­duc­tion in in­ci­dence seen be­tween 2015 and last year and a 14% drop in deaths in the same pe­riod. The WHO Euro­pean Re­gion has al­most reached the 2020 mile­stone for re­duc­tions in in­ci­dence and deaths, and the African Re­gion has made good progress. Sev­enty-eight coun­tries are on track to reach the 2020 mile­stone for re­duc­tions in in­ci­dence, in­clud­ing seven high TB bur­den coun­tries that have reached it (Cam­bo­dia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion, South Africa and Tan­za­nia). More peo­ple re­ceived life-sav­ing treat­ment for TB last year than ever be­fore, largely due to im­proved de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis. Glob­ally, 7.1 mil­lion peo­ple were di­ag­nosed and treated for TB last year – up from 6.4 mil­lion in 2017. In cu­mu­la­tive terms, 14.1 mil­lion peo­ple were treated for TB in 2018 and last year, this is more than a third of the way to­wards the five-year (2018 to 2022) tar­get of 40 mil­lion. Progress in reach­ing the miss­ing peo­ple with TB has been mainly driven by the flag­ship ini­tia­tive of the WHO Direc­tor-General – Find.Treat. All.#EndTB jointly with Stop TB Part­ner­ship and Global Fund; a strate­gic ini­tia­tive of the Global Fund, fo­cused on 13 coun­tries and through the work of USAid in pri­or­ity coun­tries. Progress in ex­pand­ing ac­cess to TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment has been slower. Around 6.3 mil­lion peo­ple started TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment in 2018 to last year, about one-fifth of the way to­wards the five-year tar­get of 30 mil­lion. Al­though drug re­sis­tant TB re­mains a pub­lic health cri­sis, there was some progress in test­ing, de­tec­tion and treat­ment of drug-re­sis­tant TB be­tween 2018 and last year. Yet only one in three ac­cess care. Bet­ter data is be­ing col­lated on the cat­a­strophic financial im­pact of TB on the lives of those af­fected. Since 2015, 17 coun­tries (in­clud­ing 10 high TB bur­den coun­tries) have com­pleted a na­tional sur­vey of costs faced by TB pa­tients and their house­holds – 49% of peo­ple with TB and their house­holds faced cat­a­strophic costs. For peo­ple with drug-re­sis­tant TB, the fig­ure was higher. Fund­ing re­mains a ma­jor is­sue. This year, fund­ing for TB preven­tion, di­ag­no­sis, treat­ment and care reached $6.5bil­lion (about R104bn), rep­re­sent­ing half of the $13bn tar­get agreed by world lead­ers in the UN Dec­la­ra­tion. Most avail­able TB fund­ing (85%) came from do­mes­tic sources, with Brazil, Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion, In­dia, China and South Africa pro­vid­ing 57% of the global to­tal. In­ter­na­tional donor fund­ing re­mains im­por­tant, es­pe­cially for low-in­come coun­tries. The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and Malaria was the largest source of in­ter­na­tional TB fi­nanc­ing this year, while the US re­mains the big­gest bi­lat­eral fun­der of ef­forts to end TB. There have been in­ten­si­fied ef­forts on re­search and in­no­va­tion to drive the development of af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble rapid point-of-care tests, as well as new, safer and more ef­fec­tive treat­ments and vac­cines. Mem­ber States called on the WHO in 2018 to de­velop a Global strat­egy for TB re­search and in­no­va­tion that lays out key steps that gov­ern­ments and non­state ac­tors can un­der­take. The strat­egy was adopted by the World Health As­sem­bly in Au­gust. Fur­ther progress to­wards end­ing TB will de­pend on ac­tion across sec­tors, un­der­scor­ing the im­por­tance of the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the WHO’s mul­ti­sec­toral ac­count­abil­ity frame­work on TB launched last year as re­quested in the UN po­lit­i­cal dec­la­ra­tion. Last year and this year, the WHO worked with high TB-bur­den coun­tries to en­sure the in­clu­sion of ac­count­abil­ity mech­a­nisms in na­tional bud­get plan­ning and pur­su­ing as­sess­ment dur­ing high-level mis­sions and joint TB pro­gramme re­views with en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety rep­re­sen­ta­tives as well as youth. The WHO has been work­ing closely with mem­ber states, part­ners and civil so­ci­ety to scale up the TB re­sponse, in­clud­ing through reg­u­lar guide­line up­dates, high level ad­vo­cacy, sup­port to coun­tries, ad­vanc­ing mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion and ac­count­abil­ity, strength­ened mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion and in­ten­si­fied re­search and in­no­va­tion. The close en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety through the WHO’s Civil So­ci­ety task­force has been crit­i­cal. A re­cent progress re­port from the UN Sec­re­tary-General de­vel­oped with the WHO sup­port out­lines 10 pri­or­ity ac­tions for Mem­ber States and other stake­hold­ers to close gaps in TB care, fi­nanc­ing and re­search, as well as ad­vance mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion and ac­count­abil­ity, in­clud­ing in the con­text of the Covid-19 pan­demic: Fully ac­ti­vate high-level lead­er­ship to ur­gently re­duce TB deaths and drive mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion to end TB. Ur­gently in­crease fund­ing for es­sen­tial TB ser­vices in­clud­ing for the health work­force. Ad­vance univer­sal health coverage to en­sure all peo­ple with TB have ac­cess to af­ford­able qual­ity care and re­solve un­der-re­port­ing chal­lenges. Ad­dress the drug-re­sis­tant TB cri­sis to close per­sis­tent gaps in care. Dra­mat­i­cally scale up pro­vi­sion of TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment. Pro­mote hu­man rights and com­bat stigma and dis­crim­i­na­tion. En­sure mean­ing­ful en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety, com­mu­ni­ties and peo­ple af­fected by TB. Sub­stan­tially in­crease in­vest­ments in TB re­search to drive tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs and rapid up­take of in­no­va­tions. En­sure that TB preven­tion and care are safe­guarded in the con­text of Covid-19 and other emerg­ing threats. Re­quest the WHO to con­tinue to pro­vide global lead­er­ship for the TB re­sponse, work­ing in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with mem­ber states and other stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing to pre­pare for a High-Level Meet­ing on TB in 2023. TB is a dis­ease of poverty. Poverty (for ex­am­ple, through un­der­nour­ish­ment) in­creases the risk of TB and de­creases the chances of it be­ing de­tected and treated early due to financial and other bar­ri­ers to health care, in­clud­ing di­ag­no­sis and care. Covid-19 and its im­pact on economies will fuel TB epi­demics as a re­sult of job losses and mass en­tries into poverty as well as re­pur­posed TB ser­vices to sup­port the Covid-19 re­sponse. The former can be pre­vented through ef­fec­tive so­cial pro­tec­tion pro­grammes, which are part of the univer­sal health coverage agenda of the WHO. The lat­ter should be mit­i­gated, set­ting a pol­icy of TB ser­vices as es­sen­tial to main­tain. Covid-19’s im­pact will fuel TB as a re­sult of job losses and mass en­tries into poverty Part 1 of a 2-part se­ries.",南非

It also ex­pands on the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral’s 2020 progress re­port on TB. The Covid-19 pan­demic fur­ther threat­ens to re­verse gains. There has been sig­nif­i­cant im­pact with the work done to date in reach­ing and pro­vid­ing pre­ven­tion and care to peo­ple with TB. In GTR, the WHO is an­nounc­ing that around 63 mil­lion lives have been saved since the year 2000. There was a 9% re­duc­tion in in­ci­dence seen be­tween 2015 and last year and a 14% drop in deaths in the same pe­riod. The WHO Euro­pean Re­gion has al­most reached the 2020 mile­stone for re­duc­tions in in­ci­dence and deaths, and the African Re­gion has made good progress. Seventy-eight coun­tries are on track to reach the 2020 mile­stone for re­duc­tions in in­ci­dence, in­clud­ing seven high TB bur­den coun­tries that have reached it (Cam­bo­dia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Namibia, the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion, South Africa and Tan­za­nia). More peo­ple re­ceived life-sav­ing treat­ment for TB last year than ever be­fore, largely due to im­proved de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis. Glob­ally, 7.1 mil­lion peo­ple were di­ag­nosed and treated for TB last year – up from 6.4 mil­lion in 2017. In cu­mu­la­tive terms, 14.1 mil­lion peo­ple were treated for TB in 2018 and last year, this is more than a third of the way to­wards the five-year (2018 to 2022) tar­get of 40 mil­lion. Progress in reach­ing the miss­ing peo­ple with TB has been mainly driven by the flag­ship ini­tia­tive of the WHO Direc­tor-Gen­eral – Find.Treat. All.#EndTB jointly with Stop TB Part­ner­ship and Global Fund; a strate­gic ini­tia­tive of the Global Fund, fo­cused on 13 coun­tries and through the work of USAid in pri­or­ity coun­tries. Progress in ex­pand­ing ac­cess to TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment has been slower. Around 6.3 mil­lion peo­ple started TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment in 2018 to last year, about one-fifth of the way to­wards the five-year tar­get of 30 mil­lion. Al­though drug re­sis­tant TB re­mains a pub­lic health cri­sis, there was some progress in test­ing, de­tec­tion and treat­ment of drug-re­sis­tant TB be­tween 2018 and last year. Yet only one in three ac­cess care. Bet­ter data is be­ing col­lated on the cat­a­strophic fi­nan­cial im­pact of TB on the lives of those af­fected. Since 2015, 17 coun­tries (in­clud­ing 10 high TB bur­den coun­tries) have com­pleted a na­tional sur­vey of costs faced by TB pa­tients and their house­holds – 49% of peo­ple with TB and their house­holds faced cat­a­strophic costs. For peo­ple with drug-re­sis­tant TB, the fig­ure was higher. Fund­ing re­mains a ma­jor is­sue. This year, fund­ing for TB pre­ven­tion, di­ag­no­sis, treat­ment and care reached $6.5bil­lion (about R104bn), rep­re­sent­ing half of the $13bn tar­get agreed by world lead­ers in the UN Dec­la­ra­tion. Most avail­able TB fund­ing (85%) came from do­mes­tic sources, with Brazil, Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion, In­dia, China and South Africa pro­vid­ing 57% of the global to­tal. In­ter­na­tional donor fund­ing re­mains im­por­tant, especially for low-in­come coun­tries. The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and Malaria was the largest source of in­ter­na­tional TB fi­nanc­ing this year, while the US re­mains the big­gest bi­lat­eral fun­der of ef­forts to end TB. There have been in­ten­si­fied ef­forts on re­search and in­no­va­tion to drive the de­vel­op­ment of af­ford­able and ac­ces­si­ble rapid point-of-care tests, as well as new, safer and more ef­fec­tive treat­ments and vac­cines. Mem­ber States called on the WHO in 2018 to de­velop a Global strat­egy for TB re­search and in­no­va­tion that lays out key steps that govern­ments and non­state ac­tors can un­der­take. The strat­egy was adopted by the World Health As­sem­bly in Au­gust. Fur­ther progress to­wards end­ing TB will de­pend on ac­tion across sec­tors, un­der­scor­ing the im­por­tance of the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the WHO’s mul­ti­sec­toral ac­count­abil­ity frame­work on TB launched last year as re­quested in the UN po­lit­i­cal dec­la­ra­tion. Last year and this year, the WHO worked with high TB-bur­den coun­tries to en­sure the inclusion of ac­count­abil­ity mech­a­nisms in na­tional bud­get plan­ning and pur­su­ing assess­ment dur­ing high-level mis­sions and joint TB pro­gramme re­views with en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety rep­re­sen­ta­tives as well as youth. The WHO has been work­ing closely with mem­ber states, part­ners and civil so­ci­ety to scale up the TB re­sponse, in­clud­ing through reg­u­lar guide­line up­dates, high level ad­vo­cacy, sup­port to coun­tries, ad­vanc­ing mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion and ac­count­abil­ity, strength­ened mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion and in­ten­si­fied re­search and in­no­va­tion. The close en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety through the WHO’s Civil So­ci­ety task­force has been crit­i­cal. A re­cent progress re­port from the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral de­vel­oped with the WHO sup­port out­lines 10 pri­or­ity ac­tions for Mem­ber States and other stake­hold­ers to close gaps in TB care, fi­nanc­ing and re­search, as well as ad­vance mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion and ac­count­abil­ity, in­clud­ing in the con­text of the Covid-19 pan­demic: ● Fully ac­ti­vate high-level lead­er­ship to ur­gently re­duce TB deaths and drive mul­ti­sec­toral ac­tion to end TB. Ur­gently in­crease fund­ing for es­sen­tial TB services in­clud­ing for the health work­force. ● Ad­vance uni­ver­sal health cov­er­age to en­sure all peo­ple with TB have ac­cess to af­ford­able qual­ity care and re­solve un­der-re­port­ing chal­lenges. ● Ad­dress the drug-re­sis­tant TB cri­sis to close per­sis­tent gaps in care. ● Dra­mat­i­cally scale up pro­vi­sion of TB pre­ven­tive treat­ment. Pro­mote hu­man rights and com­bat stigma and dis­crim­i­na­tion. En­sure mean­ing­ful en­gage­ment of civil so­ci­ety, com­mu­ni­ties and peo­ple af­fected by TB. Sub­stan­tially in­crease in­vest­ments in TB re­search to drive tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs and rapid up­take of in­no­va­tions. ● En­sure that TB pre­ven­tion and care are safe­guarded in the con­text of Covid-19 and other emerg­ing threats. Re­quest the WHO to con­tinue to pro­vide global lead­er­ship for the TB re­sponse, work­ing in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with mem­ber states and other stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing to pre­pare for a High-Level Meet­ing on TB in 2023. TB is a dis­ease of poverty. Poverty (for ex­am­ple, through un­der­nour­ish­ment) in­creases the risk of TB and de­creases the chances of it be­ing de­tected and treated early due to fi­nan­cial and other bar­ri­ers to health care, in­clud­ing di­ag­no­sis and care. Covid-19 and its im­pact on economies will fuel TB epi­demics as a re­sult of job losses and mass en­tries into poverty as well as re­pur­posed TB services to sup­port the Covid-19 re­sponse.

za,Pretoria News,20201105,State of world fight against TB,"THE Global Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis Re­port (GTR) 2020, pub­lished last month by the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO), is a sober­ing re­minder of the war against a deadly pathogen, which re­mains one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. TB has plagued the world for cen­turies, with 10 mil­lion peo­ple con­tract­ing the dis­ease last year. De­spite its con­tain­ment, the drug-re­sis­tant vari­ant of the dis­ease con­tin­ues to resur­face. The Covid-19 pan­demic has im­pacted on the fight against TB as re­sources are di­verted and de­tec­tions de­crease, typ­i­cally trig­gered by na­tional lock­downs. Restor­ing TB de­tec­tion and care ser­vices is slow and in­com­plete. South Africa is among the High Bur­den TB coun­tries. Al­though drug-re­sis­tant TB is not in­creas­ing in South Africa, the num­ber of over­all cases has in­creased year on year. In­equal­i­ties in wealth and ac­cess to health care are ag­gra­vated in the ab­sence of ef­fec­tive mit­i­ga­tion poli­cies. In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view, Dr Tereza Kasaeva, the di­rec­tor of the Global TB Pro­gramme, spoke about the state of the fight against TB, the im­pact of Covid-19, the wis­dom of set­ting global tar­gets, the spec­tre of drug-re­sis­tant vari­ants, the chal­lenges of health in­equal­ity and the pri­or­i­ties of the WHO in mit­i­gat­ing TB in the com­ing years. Mush­tak Parker: GTR 2020 is a very sober doc­u­ment about the com­plex­i­ties, con­tain­ment and the medium-term chal­lenges in the fight against a “very pre­ventable and cur­able dis­ease”. What is the com­pelling story of this fight against TB and how do we main­tain the gains made de­spite the ad­ver­sity? Dr Tereza Kasaeva: TB re­mains the world’s top in­fec­tious killer, claim­ing close to 4 000 lives a day, and 1.4 mil­lion lives an­nu­ally. It is the lead­ing killer of peo­ple with HIV and a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor of an­timi­cro­bial re­sis­tance-re­lated deaths. Ten mil­lion peo­ple fell ill with TB world­wide last year, in­clud­ing 5.6 mil­lion men, 3.2 mil­lion women and 1.2 mil­lion chil­dren. Among all those af­fected, 8.2% were peo­ple liv­ing with HIV. This pre­ventable and cur­able dis­ease places an enor­mous hu­man and so­ci­etal toll on those af­fected, their fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties. To ac­cel­er­ate the re­sponse to end TB, two years ago, heads of state and other world lead­ers gath­ered for the first UN High Level Meet­ing on Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and made bold com­mit­ments, that have of­fered hope for end­ing the death and suf­fer­ing of mil­lions world­wide from TB. This year marks a mid­point of ef­forts to ac­cel­er­ate the TB re­sponse to reach the 2022 tar­gets promised in the UN High Level meet­ing dec­la­ra­tion. GTR 2020 show­cases global, re­gional and coun­try progress, while high­light­ing that much re­mains to be done to reach the TB tar­gets set in the WHO End TB Strat­egy, the UN Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) and the dec­la­ra­tion of the UN high-level meet­ing on TB.

za,Cape Times,20150615,Africa needs to fol­low in China’s foot­steps to achieve higher rates,"WHEN you are look­ing over the beau­ti­ful At­lantic Ocean from the har­bour in Cape Town, host city of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa 2015, it is easy to con­vince your­self that Africa’s longterm out­look is pos­i­tive. A num­ber of fac­tors are pulling it in the right di­rec­tion. The top 10 per­form­ing African coun­tries have a com­bined growth rate that av­er­aged 7.6 per­cent over the past decade. Nige­ria, Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozam­bique, An­gola and Zam­bia also have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of around 700 mil­lion peo­ple. Even over the past five years, hardly a be­nign en­vi­ron­ment, growth has been 6.6 per­cent. Th­ese stats are im­pres­sive. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that pop­u­la­tion growth has been around 2.5 per­cent year on year, which means that per capita growth has been run­ning at around 5 per­cent. A 5 per­cent rate of growth means that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita will more than dou­ble in the next 20 years and that in 30 years, GDP in th­ese coun­tries will be where Morocco and Ja­maica are to­day; in 40 years they will reach the same level as In­done­sia in 2014. There will be progress, but not a rapid Asian-es­que trans­for­ma­tion. If Africa’s top 10 were able to match Asia’s growth rate – closer to 7 per­cent GDP per capita (im­ply­ing a 10 per­cent year-on-year GDP growth rate for the next decade be­fore pop­u­la­tion growth be­gins to de­cel­er­ate) – then they would be able to turn them­selves into Colom­bia and Thai­land in 30 years and to Es­to­nia and the Czech Repub­lic in 40. Africa is grow­ing fast, much faster than it did in the 1980s or 1990s, but the growth rate has to ac­cel­er­ate to de­liver what China and the south-east Asian tigers have done. Africa needs to find a road that leads to the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. Chang­ing growth mod­els With the fall in com­mod­ity prices, the ques­tion of how to boost growth is back at the top of the agenda. But there are rea­sons to be bear­ish on a quick re­cov­ery in the com­modi­ties mar­ket. China is chang­ing its growth model and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set the coun­try on a more sus­tain­able course. Mean­while, other fast-grow­ing Asian na­tions like In­dia, In­done­sia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines will not be as re­source­hun­gry as China be­cause the sub­si­dies for in­ten­sive con­sump­tion in a man­u­fac­tur­ing­driven growth model are not there. They will con­sume nat­u­ral re­sources, but not at the same pace or rate as China. To many, the elec­tion re­sult in Nige­ria came as a sur­prise. But from an­other per­spec­tive, the change of gov­ern­ment from Good­luck Jonathan to Muham­madu Buhari was a sign that Africa is ma­tur­ing. When peo­ple are si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­com­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated and more ur­banised, while in­for­ma­tion flows more freely and hu­man rights is­sues are at the fore­front, it is nat­u­ral that there will be more regular tran­si­tions be­tween gov­ern­ments. You can hardly hold Jonathan re­spon­si­ble for the col­lapse of the oil price, but Nige­ria could have done more to build buf­fers against the var­i­ous crises fac­ing the coun­try. The con­flict with Boko Haram has es­ca­lated in the north, im­port prices have been pushed up by the de­pre­ci­a­tion of the naira, cor­rup­tion is high and poverty re­duc­tion has been slower than in other coun­tries. It could be ar­gued that the best thing for Nige­ria now would be if Jonathan joins for­mer pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo as a re­spected leader in a peer role. Mean­while, if Buhari can as­sume the role of eco­nomic re­former, then this will be a game-changer. Low oil prices can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to re­form en­ergy sub­si­dies, as Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has done in In­done­sia, to strengthen public fi­nances. The fact that naira has de­pre­ci­ated heav­ily could be used as an op­por­tu­nity to open up and di­ver­sify the econ­omy. Nige­rian in­dus­try must be much more com­pet­i­tive so tar­iffs and a myr­iad of bar­ri­ers to trade can be dis­man­tled. The weak cur­rency could also boost prof­itabil­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and be­come a build­ing block for more in­clu­sive growth that does a bet­ter job of re­duc­ing poverty. A sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety is to end ‘win­ner-takes-all’ democ­racy and the con­cept of an ‘our turn to eat’ po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. If this can be­come the norm, then Africa will take a huge step to­wards reach­ing 10 per­cent growth. There have been con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ing role in Africa. Let me take the op­po­site po­si­tion. China’s econ­omy grew by 10 per­cent year on year for four decades, and the coun­try achieved the fastest trans­for­ma­tion from poverty to pros­per­ity. Africa needs to be­come more Chi­nese. Here are four rea­sons why: China let mar­ket forces work in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. The house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem – which gave house­holds rel­a­tive au­ton­omy over land and crops – and sub­se­quent re­forms led to 15 per­cent an­nual growth in agri­cul­ture over the years that fol­lowed. When the same hap­pens in Africa, with the dereg­u­la­tion of cof­fee in Rwanda an ex­am­ple, the re­sults will come. China did its best to pro­tect com­pet­i­tive­ness by push­ing its cur­rency to an ar­ti­fi­cially low level. A weak cur­rency is of­ten good for farm­ers who ex­port their pro­duce but prob­lem­atic for im­porters in ur­ban ar­eas. Some­times, for ex­am­ple, if a gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in its ur­ban ar­eas, a strong cur­rency to sub­sidise food im­ports seems log­i­cal, although it does hurt the ma­jor­ity of farm­ers. But an ar­ti­fi­cially weak cur­rency – even if it might up­set the US and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) – is es­sen­tial for an ex­port-led growth model and only ex­port ori­en­ta­tion can bring about 10 per­cent growth. African cur­ren­cies are now weak. Keep them weak and use this as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out struc­tural re­forms and re­move bar­ri­ers to trade. China has forced up its sav­ings rate. It peaked at 50 per­cent be­fore the cri­sis and in the mid-1990s it hov­ered around 40 per­cent. To some ex­tent this has been a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of a weak ex­change rate, low in­ter­est rates and fi­nan­cial re­pres­sion. With high sav­ings rates it’s also pos­si­ble to mo­bilise the nec­es­sary do­mes­tic cap­i­tal to sus­tain high in­vest­ment rates. Sav­ings rates in the Asian growth mir­a­cle coun­tries have in gen­eral been high and in­vest­ment lev­els are of­ten be­tween 30 per­cent to 40 per­cent of GDP. No coun­try has grown for a sus­tained pe­riod with­out in­vest­ment above 30 per­cent of GDP, but the sav­ings rate in Africa is more of­ten close to 20 per­cent. Of course, high in­vest­ment brings with it a risk of large cur­rent ac­count deficits and the dan­ger that a coun­try could run into a bal­ance of pay­ments cri­sis. High do­mes­tic sav­ings counter that risk. An es­sen­tial fea­ture of the Chi­nese road to 10 per­cent growth is open­ness to tech­nol­ogy. Tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions are slow and costly. The good news, how­ever, is that you don’t need to in­no­vate; you can just copy at very low cost. This is the Silk Road to a 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. It’s pos­si­ble for Africa’s top 10 coun­tries to move in this di­rec­tion, but there are ma­jor ob­sta­cles to over­come. The macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment has re­cently taken a more chal­leng­ing turn. The cur­rency tur­moil that will prob­a­bly fol­low the Fed­eral Re­serve’s de­ci­sion to in­crease rates will also af­fect Africa.

za,Cape Times,20151207,Sum­mit hailed a ‘re­sound­ing’ suc­cess,"JOHANNESBURG: The Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) sum­mit, hosted in Johannesburg, was char­ac­terised as a re­sound­ing suc­cess and as hav­ing changed the course of history by Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping on Satur­day evening. “It is a his­toric meet­ing in the history of China-Africa re­la­tions. The sum­mit, this time, has been a re­sound­ing suc­cess,” Xi told African heads of state, African Union of­fi­cials and me­dia gath­ered for the clos­ing cer­e­mony. He added that it was a “per­fect and ex­tra­or­di­nary meet­ing” and “we have made history”. Zuma echoed his sen­ti­ments, de­scrib­ing the sum­mit, which had raised the level of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Africa and China to a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic and co-op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship, as “a ground­break­ing and mo­men­tous oc­ca­sion”. In his clos­ing speech, Zuma urged that the agree­ments and pledges made at the sum­mit be swiftly im­ple­mented to im­prove lives. “The Johannesburg sum­mit dec­la­ra­tion clearly out­lines the way for­ward as we im­ple­ment the pro­gramme of ac­tion aris­ing from this sum­mit. The an­nounce­ments and agree­ments made here must trans­late to con­crete ac­tion and out­comes that will be felt by our peo­ple,” Zuma said. Both Xi and Zuma de­scribed the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Africa and China as a trust­ing and equal broth­er­hood, with Zuma not­ing that “China was there when we needed help most and we will never forget that sol­i­dar­ity and com­rade­ship”. Chi­nese del­e­gates had been at pains through­out the sum­mit to char­ac­terise their re­la­tion­ship with Africa as broth­erly and sup­port­ive, with the over-rid­ing in­ten­tion of help­ing Africa build ca­pac­ity to drive its own de­vel­op­ment. China’s 10-point pro­gramme of co-op­er­a­tion with Africa an­nounced by Xi at the be­gin­ning of the sum­mit was fre­quently char­ac­terised by del­e­gates from both sides as help­ing to cre­ate the Africa that Africa wants and as a fit­ting re­sponse to Africa’s own stated de­vel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties. An­other re­cur­ring theme of the con­fer­ence was that China’s will­ing­ness to help was matched by rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence and ap­pro­pri­ate ca­pac­ity to help. China’s own ex­pe­ri­ence of speedy and com­pre­hen­sive in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion over the last 30-plus years was held up as hold­ing many lessons that were rel­e­vant to de­vel­op­ment in Africa. The Chi­nese for­eign min­is­ter Wang Yi told a press con­fer­ence at the end of the sum­mit that the 10-point pro­gramme was com­pat­i­ble with Africa’s most ur­gent needs. He said that al­most all African coun­tries had al­ready recog­nised the need to in­dus­tri­alise as well as to mod­ernise agri­cul­ture, two cor­ner­stones of the pro­gramme. Wang said the pro­gramme was aimed at de­liv­er­ing ben­e­fits in ar­eas al­ready iden­ti­fied as pri­or­i­ties by most African lead­ers in­clud­ing poverty re­duc­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion and im­prove­ments in health­care. It was also aimed at clear­ing the three ma­jor bot­tle­necks hold­ing back de­vel­op­ment in Africa, namely short­age of in­fra­struc­ture, skilled per­son­nel and fund­ing. Wang noted the pro­gramme was also in keep­ing with trends of the times ac­com­mo­dat­ing mod­ern con­cerns such as sus­tain­abil­ity and pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment.",南非
za,The Mercury,20200422,Lancet edi­tor slams UK gov­ern­ment for its slow coro­n­avirus re­sponse,"or ex­port­ing them?” asked Michele Dunne, di­rec­tor of the Mid­dle East pro­gramme at the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace. She noted re­ports that there have been out­breaks of the virus in some Egyp­tian hos­pi­tals, and some drug hoard­ing. A third of Egypt’s pop­u­la­tion of more than 100 mil­lion peo­ple live in ex­treme poverty. “Egypt giv­ing away or ex­port­ing aid will cause con­cern or even re­sent­ment in­side Egypt,” Dunne said. “What el-Sisi is do­ing with gifts or sales is to show he’s on top of Covid-19 in­side Egypt and he wants to build up some of his im­por­tant re­la­tion­ships.” The coro­n­avirus death rate in Egypt is more than 7%, Egypt Today re­ported on Sun­day, cit­ing the coun­try’s health min­is­ter. Ac­cord­ing to the web­site of the US Em­bassy in Egypt, as of Sun­day there were 3 144 con­firmed cases. The Ital­ian en­ergy gi­ant Eni is work­ing with Egypt on de­vel­op­ing a mas­sive nat­u­ral gas field in the Mediter­ranean, said Michael Wahid Hanna at the Cen­tury Foun­da­tion. Egyp­tian of­fi­cials have por­trayed the med­i­cal ship­ments as friendly ges­tures be­tween Egypt and these na­tions in light of their his­tor­i­cal al­liances. But many Egyp­tians took to so­cial me­dia ques­tion­ing their gov­ern­ment when prices of face masks and hand sani­tis­ers have soared, mak­ing them un­af­ford­able. A doc­tor and a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal worker were ar­rested by Egyp­tian se­cu­rity forces af­ter com­plain­ing about the lack of masks on a Face­book video, ac­cord­ing to UN hu­man rights of­fi­cials. THE edi­tor of The Lancet med­i­cal jour­nal, Dr Richard Hor­ton, slammed the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment for try­ing to de­fend its lack of ac­tion while the coro­n­avirus spi­ralled out of con­trol in the UK. “The fact is that min­is­ters/sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers failed to un­der­stand what was hap­pen­ing in China, de­spite ev­i­dence,” he said. Down­ing Street re­futed there was “sci­en­tific con­sen­sus” that a pan­demic was im­mi­nent, nod­ding to tweets from Hor­ton in Jan­uary which urged cau­tion about call­ing it a “killer virus”. Hor­ton re­jected claims he played down the threat of the virus, and in­stead said he had sounded the alarm on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions. Hor­ton linked to tweets he penned in Jan­uary which warned hu­mans could spread the virus be­tween each other and that there was a lack of ICU beds to cope with a pan­demic. He pub­lished grave con­cerns from China – where the virus be­gan in De­cem­ber 2019 – warn­ing other gov­ern­ments to act quickly. The Lancet jour­nal is among the world’s old­est, hav­ing a global im­pact sec­ond only to The New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine. Hor­ton de­nies Down­ing Street’s claim there was a lack of sci­en­tific con­sen­sus that the world was head­ing to­wards a pan­demic. A news­pa­per ar­ti­cle in the Sun­day Times ac­cused Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son of “sleep­walk­ing into dis­as­ter” in the early stages of the pan­demic. It pointed out that John­son missed five key CO­BRA meet­ings as the Covid-19 cri­sis gath­ered pace, that No 10 “played down the loom­ing threat” from coro­n­avirus for more than a month. Mean­while, the true ex­tent of the death toll in Bri­tain from Covid-19 was more than 40% higher than the daily fig­ures from the gov­ern­ment in­di­cated by April 10, ac­cord­ing to data that in­cludes deaths in the com­mu­nity. The Of­fice for Na­tional Statis­tics said it recorded 13121 deaths by April 10 in Eng­land and Wales, which ac­count for the vast ma­jor­ity of Bri­tain’s pop­u­la­tion, com­pared with 9 288 in the gov­ern­ment’s daily toll. The lat­est hos­pi­tal deaths data pub­lished on Mon­day show 17 382 peo­ple had died across the UK. If the UK’s fig­ures are un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the death toll by a sim­i­lar fig­ure, then the true death toll for the coun­try as a whole could be above 23000 – mak­ing it the sec­ond worst hit in Europe af­ter Italy.",南非

za,Daily Maverick,20201024,Land­slide NZ vic­tory via in­clu­sive ap­proach,"Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern’s em­phatic elec­tion vic­tory is seen as an en­dorse­ment of an in­clu­sive brand of leadership that may rip­ple be­yond New Zealand’s bor­ders. In an age of pop­ulism and con­fronta­tion, Ardern’s mes­sage of em­pa­thy and kind­ness mar­ried with sk­il­ful cri­sis man­age­ment won her Labour Party its big­gest share of the vote in more than 70 years. That con­trasts starkly with the di­vi­sive pol­i­tics in the US as Don­ald Trump and Joe Bi­den face off for the pres­i­dency on 3 Novem­ber. “Ardern’s ap­proach could be a les­son for other lead­ers seek­ing to max­imise their sup­port base,” said Zareh Ghaz­ar­ian, se­nior lec­turer in pol­i­tics at Monash Univer­sity, Mel­bourne. “Not only has she been able to lead the na­tion through very chal­leng­ing cir­cum­stances, but also suc­cess­fully com­mu­ni­cate an over­all vi­sion. In New Zealand it’s about the pol­i­tics of in­clu­sion.” Ardern, 40, won in­ter­na­tional plau­dits for her re­sponse to the deadly shoot­ings at two mosques in 2019, don­ning a head­scarf as a mark of re­spect as she mourned with the Mus­lim com­mu­nity. This year, she’s demon­strated her steel in tack­ling the pan­demic, en­act­ing one of the world’s strictest lock­downs to crush com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. She rode the re­sult­ing wave of adu­la­tion to se­cure the first out­right ma­jor­ity in par­lia­ment since New Zealand in­tro­duced pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion in 1996. Labour won 49% of the vote and 64 of the 120 seats in par­lia­ment. The scale of the win may fuel her global ap­peal among those who al­ready view her as a stan­dard-bearer for lib­eral val­ues. Ardern is now in a po­si­tion to lead New Zealand’s most left-lean­ing gov­ern­ment in decades but has yet to de­cide whether to in­clude her ally the Green Party, which wants more ac­tion on poverty and cli­mate change. Sup­port­ers want Ardern to push harder on re­forms such as tack­ling in­equal­ity and boost­ing in­comes af­ter she failed to de­liver on some key prom­ises in her first term. She ditched plans for a cap­i­tal gains tax that might have ad­dressed the widen­ing gap be­tween rich and poor, while a pro­gramme to build tens of thou­sands of new homes to help fix a hous­ing cri­sis fell well short of goals. ‘Huge Dilemma’ “It’s go­ing to be a huge dilemma for her, whether to go to the left or stay in that cen­tre ground,” said Lara Greaves, lec­turer in New Zealand pol­i­tics, Univer­sity of Auck­land. “Does she want to try to be a four-term prime min­is­ter or does she want to make trans­for­ma­tional pol­icy that changes peo­ple’s lives?” Her re-elec­tion spells con­ti­nu­ity in a nu­anced for­eign pol­icy to­wards China. Ardern has tried not to an­tag­o­nise New Zealand’s largest trad­ing part­ner while main­tain­ing close ties with the US and other Western al­lies in the Five Eyes in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing al­liance. Her fo­cus will be on the eco­nomic and so­cial chal­lenges ahead as New Zealand charts a re­cov­ery from re­ces­sion. The bor­der is ex­pected to re­main closed well into 2021, dec­i­mat­ing in­ter­na­tional tourism and ed­u­ca­tion. Labour said it will im­pose a 39% tax on in­come over NZ$180,000 to help pay for the Covid re­sponse and keep debt un­der con­trol. It aims to stim­u­late in­vest­ment and cre­ate jobs through ma­jor in­fra­struc­ture projects and in­cen­tives for small busi­ness. Prop­erty Boom Key to re­cov­ery may be a prop­erty boom sparked by record-low in­ter­est rates that saw house prices climb 7.6% in the past year. That has made it harder for many to en­ter the hous­ing mar­ket. She has ruled out sig­nif­i­cant tax re­forms to ad­dress wealth in­equal­ity, and given no in­di­ca­tion she in­tends to be more proac­tive on poverty and home­less­ness. Ardern stood out among her Western peers in pur­su­ing an ex­plicit elim­i­na­tion strat­egy, and im­posed one of the strictest na­tion­wide lock­downs. This shut­tered the econ­omy but wiped out com­mu­nity spread of the virus, al­low­ing re­stric­tions to be re­moved sooner than in many other coun­tries. A sec­ond out­break in Auck­land was quickly stamped out. “The way the prime min­is­ter has put health be­fore the econ­omy will be of in­ter­est, es­pe­cially for other so­cial demo­cratic lead­ers around the world,” said Bryce Ed­wards, a po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst at Victoria Univer­sity in Welling­ton. “They will now see Ardern as the leader of those left par­ties in­ter­na­tion­ally and they will want to learn from her.” Asked if she had a mes­sage for Amer­i­cans as they head into their own elec­tion, Ardern said it wasn’t her place to com­ment. “But my hope as some­one who has, of course, a strong in­ter­est in pol­i­tics is that we have elec­tions glob­ally where we try and move be­yond the di­vi­sive na­ture that elec­tions can some­times bring, be­cause that can be dam­ag­ing for democ­racy,” she said.

za,Daily Dispatch,20150123,Re­viv­ing ru­ral towns would help drive to curb poverty,"ONE of the most be­wil­der­ing things when driv­ing through the East­ern Cape’s many ru­ral towns is the state of dis­re­pair of the roads, the de­cay­ing in­fra­struc­ture, the hope­less­ness in the eyes of the many poor res­i­dents. Poverty is en­demic and it seems to me ev­ery year we plunge to new depths of despair. Lo­cal town ad­min­is­tra­tors are do­ing their best it seems but th­ese ar­eas won’t get out of the start­ing blocks with­out mas­sive in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment. This coun­try has fun­nelled a lot of in­vest­ment into ma­jor in­fra­struc­ture projects but lit­tle of this will help the ru­ral East­ern Cape. The power we will gen­er­ate in Medupi won’t reach the peo­ple of Cala if the town’s in­fra­struc­ture is in a dire state. I think mas­sive in­vest­ment in lo­cal in­fra­struc­ture will sprout new eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties in the long term while cre­at­ing mas­sive em­ploy­ment in the short term. I think the great­est op­por­tu­nity for the East­ern Cape’s ru­ral towns lies in ig­nit­ing lo­cal economies through lo­cal en­ter­prise cre­ation, teth­ered of course to mas­sive town in­fra­struc­ture re­ju­ve­na­tion. At­tract­ing out of town in­vestors can be a tool used to boost the econ­omy of th­ese towns but I think the real sus­tain­able op­por­tu­nity must be with lo­cal en­ter­prise cre­ation. In­dus­trial re­cruit­ment can be quite dev­as­tat­ing when those com­pa­nies find bet­ter lo­ca­tions else­where in the world. Big business in­vestors can be sub­ject to boom-bust cy­cles and there­fore peg­ging a town’s for­tune to such va­garies is ill-ad­vised. But the cre­ation of re­silient and vi­brant lo­cal economies presents us with more sus­tain­able prospects. Our small towns should not seek to mimic the de­vel­op­ment of Jo­han­nes­burg or East London but rather use their own unique fea­tures as a ba­sis for de­vel­op­ment. We should be us­ing mu­nic­i­pal funds and na­tional gov­ern­ment grants to build town cen­tres that are vi­brant and cre­ate spa­ces and fa­cil­i­ties to al­low young peo­ple to start and op­er­ate their own com­mu­nity ven­tures and so­cial en­ter­prises. We need to cre­ate 100 lo­cal small busi­nesses in var­i­ous forms for th­ese towns to emerge from the quag­mire of poverty. Lady Frere, Indwe and Dor­drecht have huge po­ten­tial as ad­ven­ture and aqua sport des­ti­na­tions, their breathtaking scenery is per­fect for moun­tain bik­ing. Towns like But­ter­worth have huge po­ten­tial as small-scale man­u­fac­tur­ing cen­tres. Think of wood prod­ucts hand­made by young peo­ple. I’m not sug­gest­ing we go in for prod­ucts of the kind per­fected by China but qual­ity prod­ucts that are unique and hand­crafted and can be pack­aged and branded as prod­ucts of Gcuwa. Think of wine racks, unique gar­den fur­ni­ture, book shelves etc. But­ter­worth’s nascent prop­erty sec­tor can be har­nessed suc­cess­fully given its bur­geon­ing stu­dent pop­u­la­tion. The In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion’s planned bio-fu­els project in Cradock – a R1-bil­lion project to pro­duce fuel grade bioethanol as a pri­mary prod­uct and co-prod­ucts which can be sold as high-pro­tein com­po­nents into the an­i­mal feed mar­ket – will spawn new op­por­tu­ni­ties for that town and many young peo­ple should be geared up to ex­ploit those op­por­tu­ni­ties. There is a space for small-scale or­ganic farm­ing. Con­sumers are now search­ing for or­ganic pro­duce, not the mass-pro­duced food that doc­tors are cau­tion­ing us against, say­ing th­ese are the root of many mod­ern-day dis­eases. We have the land and many un­em­ployed young peo­ple who can pro­duce or­ganic crops for lo­cal ur­ban dwellers or ex­port mar­kets. Tourism is the most un­der­de­vel­oped in­dus­try that has huge po­ten­tial to boost eco­nomic growth and re­duce un­em­ploy­ment in th­ese towns. Driv­ing on the R410 to­wards Eng­cobo from El­liot, there’s a point where a river – I think it’s the Xuka River – me­an­ders through a val­ley formed by two moun­tains on ei­ther side, and groups of lo­cal vil­lages hug the moun­tain­sides as the river makes its way past. It’s a ma­jes­tic view to be­hold. With a proper tourism prod­uct pack­aged and de­signed su­perbly, this site would draw many tourists from Ger­many right through to China. Tourism should be the main­stay of the East­ern Cape’s eco­nomic growth and it can aid the re­vival of th­ese ail­ing small ru­ral towns in our Prov­ince of Leg­ends. Queen­stown has given South Africa many of our finest jazz gi­ants in the past and con­tin­ues to pro­duce them even to­day. I am as­tounded this town has noth­ing to show for this. It can be quite a des­ti­na­tion for jazz lovers across the world. I’m think­ing of jazz parks or av­enues, jazz mu­se­ums, and an in­ter­na­tion­al­lyrenowned jazz fes­ti­val which can boost own­ers of ac­com­mo­da­tion es­tab­lish­ments in the town. All th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties could give South Africa’s “Lit­tle Jazz Town” the nec­es­sary eco­nomic stim­u­lus it needs. All this can be achieved while us­ing its her­itage and unique fea­tures. Look at what Nel­son Man­dela and Des­mond Tutu have done for Or­lando West’s Vi­lakazi Street. Lastly, cor­rup­tion should be dealt with be­fore our lofty mis­sion of re­ju­ve­na­tion takes place. I’m told cor­rup­tion is more grotesque in ru­ral towns. Crony­ism and fleecing of the lo­cal gov­ern­ment purse will not only bring mis­ery on lo­cal res­i­dents but will give rise to ghost towns. To sug­gest th­ese towns are at an ex­is­ten­tial cross­roads would be ba­nal un­less the down­ward trend is ar­rested. Poverty of the scale we see in th­ese small towns af­fronts even the most rudi­men­tary hu­man rights en­shrined in our con­sti­tu­tion, makes a mock­ery of our democ­racy, nul­li­fies the gains of free­dom, smoth­ers the spirit of our new na­tion but mostly, dims our prospects for the fu­ture. Such poverty gnaws at the moral ed­i­fice of our com­mu­ni­ties and its young peo­ple are usu­ally the most af­fected.

The king was ad­dress­ing a Zulu-Chi­nese Cul­tural Pro­mo­tion As­so­ci­a­tion event in Jo­han­nes­burg ear­lier this week. The part­ner­ship will see China work­ing with the Royal House­hold to pro­mote cul­tural her­itage and tourism be­tween China and South Africa. China and South Africa are Brics mem­bers, along with Brazil, Rus­sia and In­dia . “Pre­vi­ously, we wit­nessed a sit­u­a­tion, whereby these very sig­nif­i­cant re­la­tion­ships be­tween our gov­ern­ments such as Brics for­ma­tion bi­lat­eral agree­ments end up be­ing talks and sig­na­to­ries that do not ben­e­fit peo­ple di­rect,” he said. Zwelithini said Brics should ex­tend to “peo­ple-topeo­ple” re­la­tion­ships. “It is a fact that while gov­ern­ments come and go, peo­ple re­main, thus it is im­por­tant to in­vest into a part­ner­ship that is be­yond a sit­ting govern­ment,” he said. He said while Brics played an im­por­tant role in cre­at­ing po­lit­i­cal and eco­nom­i­cal re­la­tions among govern­ment, “lead­ers should not lose sight of the im­por­tance of in­volv­ing peo­ple”. Zwelithini said South Africa should strengthen its re­la­tion­ship with China, as the coun­try had al­ready over­taken Amer­ica’s econ­omy. He said the visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in 2015, which re­sulted in 26 agree­ments worth R84 bil­lion, should be used to ad­dress South Africa’s chal­lenges such as poverty, un­em­ploy­ment and in­equal­ity. He said even be­fore the ex­is­tence of Brics, the Zulu and Chi­nese na­tions had cre­ated re­la­tion­ships, and that the two should con­tinue “this solid part­ner­ship”. “For my peo­ple who are pre­dom­i­nantly in KwaZulu-Natal but spread across many other prov­inces, I need to em­pha­sise that, they need to be in­volved se­ri­ously on mat­ters of trade, whereby we need to iden­tify prod­ucts and ser­vices that can be traded be­tween our two cul­tures,” the king said. He said as part of ex­pand­ing cul­tural re­la­tions, Chi­nese Man­darin and Zulu lan­guages should be learnt by young peo­ple “as it is easy to do busi­ness when you speak some­one’s lan­guage”.

za,The Star Late Edition,20151013,Fo­cus on symp­toms won’t solve poverty,"Pa­trick Bond THE UBIQ­UI­TOUS “de­vel­op­ment goals” cho­sen by the UN – first Mil­len­nium (MDGs) in 2000 and now Sus­tain­able (SDGs) – were and are and will be a dis­trac­tion from the real work of fight­ing poverty done by so­cial jus­tice ac­tivists, in­clud­ing South Africans. The New York meet­ings late last month her­alded another of the an­nual UN head­sof-state sum­mits at which in­ap­pro­pri­ate tar­gets, pro­cesses and eval­u­a­tion sys­tems are re­con­firmed. Politi­cians joined mul­ti­lat­eral bu­reau­crats to con­grat­u­late each other for hit­ting many of the MDG tar­gets dur­ing the 2000-15 pe­riod. Now there are 17 new SDGs with 169 new tar­gets and more than 300 in­di­ca­tors to aim for by 2030. But since most state elites are not truly com­mit­ted to these, the big ques­tion is whether SDGs can mo­ti­vate ac­tivists work­ing in the trenches against the sys­tems of power that cre­ate poverty, hunger, dis­ease and cli­mate change. The UN, in con­trast, shies away from con­sid­er­ing or at­tribut­ing causes, pre­fer­ring to fo­cus on symp­toms. As a re­sult, the poverty-cre­at­ing and ecol­ogy-de­stroy­ing fea­tures of the world econ­omy will pro­ceed en­tirely un­hin­dered by UN hot air. Tellingly, there are no con­crete manda­tory green­house gas emis­sions-cut goals in the SDG “13 – Cli­mate ac­tion”, which sim­ply en­cour­ages the Paris UN cli­mate sum­mit in De­cem­ber to adopt vol­un­tary pledges. These are, frankly, use­less. Manda­tory cuts are vi­tal if catas­tro­phe is to be avoided. And il­lus­trat­ing the UN’s bean-count­ing con­tor­tions, the very first SDG is, “by 2030, erad­i­cate ex­treme poverty for all peo­ple ev­ery­where, cur­rently mea­sured as peo­ple liv­ing on less than $1.25 (about R16) a day”. That mea­sure comes from heart­less World Bank econ­o­mists, and gives us a 2015 world poverty count of just 1.2 bil­lion peo­ple. But what if you need not just food but min­i­mal health care, a roof over your head and cloth­ing? The UN Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment says the tar­get should be $5 a day. At one in­valu­able watchdog group, “The Rules”, Jason Hickel de­bunks: “The drafters of the SDGs know this fact. So why stick with the dis­cred­ited $1.25 mea­sure? Be­cause it’s the only one that will al­low them to get any­where near their goal of erad­i­cat­ing poverty by 2030. If we mea­sure poverty by the more ac­cu­rate $5/day line, the to­tal poverty head­count rises to 4.3 bil­lion peo­ple, more than 60 per­cent of hu­man­ity.” That’s 370 mil­lion more peo­ple than in 1990. Here in South Africa, World Bank econ­o­mists claimed late last year that at $1.25/day, ex­treme poverty rate is suf­fered by just 16.5 per­cent of our 55 mil­lion res­i­dents, half what it was be­fore con­sid­er­ing state grants to chil­dren and the el­derly. More­over, added the bank: “Thanks to ef­fec­tive use of fis­cal pol­icy to achieve re­dis­tri­bu­tion, the Gini co­ef­fi­cient on in­come falls from 0.77 to 0.59,” a fib ob­vi­ous to any­one aware of the vast state cor­po­rate wel­fare ben­e­fits bank staff brazenly ig­nored. Bank sta­tis­tics were then re­peat­edly used by a lo­cal gag­gle of ne­olib­er­als to drum-beat for greater aus­ter­ity, and so in Fe­bru­ary, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nh­lanhla Nene obliged by shrink­ing the real value of grants by 3 per­cent. Yet at the same time, a poverty rate of 53 per­cent was cal­cu­lated by Sta­tis­tics SA us­ing $1.88/day as the bare sur­vival level. A few weeks ago, Univer­sity of Cape Town re­searchers counted $2.50/day costs of 2 100 kilo­calo­ries of food and other es­sen­tial ex­pen­di­tures and reck­oned that poverty is closer to 62 per­cent. “Tor­tur­ing the data un­til they con­fess” is what ne­olib­eral poverty ex­perts ap­par­ently feel is nec­es­sary in de­fence of their dark arts. In 2006, Africa’s lead­ing po­lit­i­cal economist, Samir Amin, de­scribed MDGtalk as “in­tended to le­git­imise the poli­cies and prac­tices im­ple­mented by dom­i­nant cap­i­tal and those who sup­port it, ie in the first place, the gov­ern­ments of the triad coun­tries (US, EU and Ja­pan), and sec­on­dar­ily, gov­ern­ments in the South”. As for MDGs cut­ting ex­treme poverty and hunger by half, Amin said: “This is noth­ing but an empty in­can­ta­tion as long as the poli­cies that gen­er­ate poverty are not an­a­lysed and de­nounced and al­ter­na­tives pro­posed.” In the jour­nal Gen­der &amp; De­vel­op­ment, Caribbean, po­lit­i­cal economist Peggy Antrobus of De­vel­op­ment Al­ter­na­tives with Women for a New Era re­named MDGs “Ma­jor Dis­trac­tion Gim­micks”. For fem­i­nists, said Antrobus: “The ex­clu­sion of the goal of women’s sex­ual and re­pro­duc­tive rights re­flects the power of the forces of re­li­gious fun­da­men­tal­ism.” The MDGs’ fo­cus on the out­comes masks the process, she told an in­ter­viewer for al­liance: “We ought to be help­ing peo­ple to un­der­stand how these things are the con­se­quences of foundly un­just.” She said: “The cur­rent macro con­text in which these MDGs have emerged con­tains the twin de­mons of re­li­gious and eco­nomic fun­da­men­tal­ism. Both have at their core the sub­or­di­na­tion and ex­ploita­tion of women’s time, labour, and sex­u­al­ity for the ben­e­fit of pa­tri­ar­chal power on the one hand, and cap­i­tal­ism on the other.” But the point here is that cre­ative peo­ple con­stantly fight ne­olib­er­al­ism, racism, pa­tri­archy and cli­mate catas­tro­phe, even if the UN ig­nores them and their ef­forts. In our cri­tique of the Global Call to Ac­tion Against Poverty a decade ago, my col­leagues Dennis Bru­tus, Vir­ginia Set­shedi and I pointed out that its open­ing news­let­ter was silent on “or­ganic an­tipoverty ac­tivism in the Global South, such as – in no par­tic­u­lar or­der – labour strikes, pop­u­lar mo­bil­i­sa­tions for Aids-treat­ment and other health ser­vices, re­con­nec­tions of wa­ter/elec­tric­ity, land and hous­ing oc­cu­pa­tions, anti-GMO and pro-food se­cu­rity cam­paigns, women’s or­gan­is­ing, mu­nic­i­pal bud­get cam­paigns, stu­dent and youth move­ments, com­mu­nity re­sis­tance to dis­place­ments caused by dam con­struc­tion and the like, anti-debt and repa­ra­tions move­ments, en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice strug­gles, im­mi­grants’ rights cam­paigns, po­lit­i­cal move­ments to take state power, etc”. We con­tin­ued, in a cri­tique that ap­plies even more to the UN: “It’s as if the for­mi­da­ble re­cent up­surge of un­rest – 1980s-’90s IMF ri­ots, high-pro­file in­dige­nous peo­ple’s protests since Za­p­atismo in 1994, global jus­tice ac­tivism since Seat­tle in 1999, the So­cial Fo­rum move­ment since 2001, an­ti­war demos since 2001, au­tonomist protests and the Latin Amer­i­can left’s re­vival – never hap­pened, don’t ex­ist, aren’t wor­thy of ac­knowl­edg­ment much less in­te­gra­tion and am­pli­fi­ca­tion.” Since then, add the north African upris­ing and the Oc­cu­piers of 2011, the rise of the south­ern Euro­pean and Ir­ish left (and maybe in the UK and US too, judg­ing by elec­toral trends), the anti-race/class/re­pres­sion move­ment in the US, NGO cam­paign­ing against il­licit fi­nan­cial flows, cli­mate cam­paign­ers against ma­jor pol­luters, antie xtrac­tivist strug­gles across the south, and more re­cent mass protests against so­cioe­co­nomic in­jus­tice and au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism in Brazil, Burk­ina Faso, China, In­dia, South Africa, Tur­key and so many other sites of strug­gle. At such mo­ments, you can count on the World Bank and UN of­fi­cials to run in the other di­rec­tion. Another di­rec­tion the SDGs dare not ven­ture to­wards is ask­ing why poverty and eco­log­i­cal chaos are re­peat­edly re­pro­duced as the flip side of wealth: in short, un­even de­vel­op­ment. In “hack­ing” the SDGs, The Rules cam­paign­ers ask three un­com­fort­able ques­tions that SDGites dare not con­sider: “How is poverty cre­ated? Who’s de­vel­op­ing whom? And why is growth the only an­swer?” Hope­fully these are the ques­tions that jour­nal­ists and the gen­eral public also start ask­ing their na­tional poverty of­fi­cials. And hope­fully, the tough cri­tiques from The Rules and scholar-ac­tivists such as Amin and Antrobus are given more air time. Oth­er­wise, with­out at­ten­tion to poverty causal­ity, with­out the ac­tivists who make so­cial change pos­si­ble, and with­out in­tel­lec­tual crit­ics un­in­tim­i­dated by of­fi­cial­dom’s back-slap­ping, these SDGs are un­sus­tain­able dis­trac­tions whose def­i­ni­tions of de­vel­op­ment and en­vi­ron­ment con­tinue be­ing twisted be­yond recog­ni­tion.

za,Cape Times,20111006,Who is South Africa’s China?,"SOUTH Africa is a mul­ti­fac­eted, mul­ti­cul­tural and mul­tira­cial coun­try that em­braces Ubuntu as a way of defin­ing who we are and how we re­late to oth­ers. The phi­los­o­phy of Ubuntu is re­flected in the idea that we af­firm our hu­man­ity when we af­firm the hu­man­ity of oth­ers. These words are taken ver­ba­tim from the draft white pa­per on South Africa’s for­eign pol­icy pub­lished this year by the Depart­ment of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Co-op­er­a­tion (DIRCO). These words de­serve closer scrutiny in the light of events sur­round­ing the Dalai lama’s visa. The South African govern­ment grabbed the Dalai Lama’s de­ci­sion to can­cel his visit with both hands to de­fend it­self, al­low­ing it to be right through a tech­ni­cal­ity. Deputy Pres­i­dent Kgalema Mot­lanthe even went fur­ther to say govern­ment would have given the Dalai Lama a visa. What­ever spin the govern­ment tries on the is­sue, there is no doubt that the man of the cloth is a hot po­lit­i­cal potato for South Africa. Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma’s ad­min­is­tra­tion may deny it, but there is no doubt that the tem­per­a­ture of this potato is de­ter­mined by the con­flict be­tween South Africa’s re­la­tion­ship with China and how that coun­try treats Ti­betans. South Africa’s re­la­tion­ship with China, which was ce­mented ear­lier this year with the in­vi­ta­tion to South Africa to join the BRIC group of na­tions, brings into sharper fo­cus the very ba­sis of this di­plo­macy. DIRCO in the draft white pa­per states: “Since 1994, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity has looked to South Africa to play a lead­ing role in cham­pi­oning val­ues of hu­man rights, democ­racy, rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and the erad­i­ca­tion of poverty and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Our unique ap­proach to global is­sues has found ex­pres­sion in the con­cept of Ubuntu. These con­cepts in­form our par­tic­u­lar ap­proach to di­plo­macy and shape our vi­sion of a bet­ter world for all.” DIRCO adds that Ubuntu en­tails re­spect of all na­tions, peo­ples, and cul­tures. In ad­di­tion, Ubuntu also means recog­ni­tion that South Africa’s national in­ter­est is linked to the pro­mo­tion and sup­port of the pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment of oth­ers. One must ask how Ubuntu has shaped South Africa’s re­la­tions with China and how it has been used in eval­u­at­ing the plight of the Ti­betan peo­ple. If the phi­los­o­phy of Ubuntu is in­deed re­flected in the idea that we af­firm our hu­man­ity when we af­firm the hu­man­ity of oth­ers, how have our ac­tions as a coun­try af­firmed the hu­man­ity of the Ti­betan peo­ple? Clearly, South Africa has cho­sen not to af­firm the hu­man­ity of the Ti­betan peo­ple, pre­sum­ably be­cause Ti­betans have noth­ing to of­fer. China, on the other hand, has a lot to of­fer. The in­duce­ment, as DIRCO points out, is eco­nomic. Now, let’s be real. Would China stop in­vest­ing or trad­ing with South Africa if we al­lowed the Dalai Lama to visit? The an­swer has to be a re­sound­ing no. We send China min­er­als and they ship to us man­u­fac­tured goods. They need raw min­er­als as much as they need mar­kets for their man­u­fac­tured goods. Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship is driven by prag­ma­tism, which ex­plains why China never cut ties with the US de­spite its mil­i­tary sup­port for Tai­wan. China may have whis­pered to their SA coun­ter­parts that they are un­happy about the Dalai Lama’s visit, and in re­sponse to such whis­pers, lead­ers of a sov­er­eign state would know what to say. Un­less, of course, South Africa’s po­lit­i­cal lead­ers have se­cured dol­lops of Chi­nese cash for the ANC, which the Chi­nese can cut off with­out af­fect­ing China’s eco­nomic in­ter­ests.",南非
za,The Sunday Independent,20180909,KOEKSISTERS AND LOANS ON GOOD TERMS,"LIT­TLE did I think that when I opened the room ser­vice menu last week at the In­ter­con­ti­nen­tal Bei­jing San­l­i­tun ho­tel I could or­der tomato bredie and koeksisters. I was keen to know if they would de­liver the Cape Malay type or the one drip­ping in syrup, both of which I find ir­re­sistible. Turns out, the Bei­jing ver­sion is more like a Latin Amer­i­can churro. Never mind, they tried. It was my first time ac­com­pa­ny­ing Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa on a state visit abroad, and this one co­in­cided with the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion, or Focac, in Bei­jing, which proved to be a far grander oc­ca­sion than I could have imag­ined. Fifty-three African heads of state flew to the city to par­tic­i­pate in the Sum­mit. For all the talk among the pun­dits about China be­ing a new colo­nial power on the con­ti­nent, Africa’s heads of state came with other is­sues in mind. Their over­ar­ch­ing agenda was how to lever­age in­ter­est-free loans to build es­sen­tial in­fra­struc­ture to con­nect our con­ti­nent’s cap­i­tals to im­prove lev­els of in­tra-African trade, train and skill our youth and con­nect the ru­ral poor to the in­ter­net, and cre­ate in­dus­trial hubs so that we ex­port more man­u­fac­tured goods to the one bil­lion-strong Chi­nese mar­ket. Un­der­ly­ing that agenda was a keen un­der­stand­ing that China has lifted 800 mil­lion of its peo­ple out of poverty, and Africa would like to do the same. The fact that China’s im­ports from Africa tend to be what we dig out of the ground, and their ex­ports to us tend to be what they pro­duce in their fac­to­ries was quite openly dis­cussed, and the Focac Be­ji­ing Action plan for the next three years is geared to cor­rect such im­bal­ances. In his key­note speech to the African fra­ter­nity, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping seemed to go out of his way to ad­dress these pri­or­i­ties head on, and an­nounce pro­grammes and ini­tia­tives that would jump start Africa’s fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion. At the last Focac Sum­mit in 2015, the world was flab­ber­gasted that China had pledged $60 bil­lion (R908bn) in de­vel­op­ment fi­nanc­ing to the con­ti­nent over three years, with the Amer­i­cans and the Bri­tish say­ing they sim­ply couldn’t com­pete. The nar­ra­tive in the West­ern me­dia then be­came that China was set­ting a debt trap for the con­ti­nent that African coun­tries would be un­able to climb out of, and would end up hand­ing over con­trol of key na­tional as­sets to the Chi­nese when they couldn’t re­pay their loans. To avoid pre­cisely this type of debt trap, which works against Africa’s eco­nomic free­dom, when Xi an­nounced a fur­ther $60bn in de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance and fi­nanc­ing for Africa last week, he added an im­por­tant caveat. Xi also an­nounced that small and un­der­de­vel­oped African coun­tries and is­land states that had their debts in­curred by 2018 would have their debts ex­empted. He also spec­i­fied that $15bn of the to­tal fi­nanc­ing would be in­ter­est-free and con­ces­sional loans. More than any­thing, we need to take ad­van­tage of the Chi­nese open­ing its huge mar­ket to African goods, and that starts by par­tic­i­pat­ing in the China In­ter­na­tional Ex­port Expo in Novem­ber, where African com­pa­nies are be­ing en­cour­aged to show­case their wares to Chi­nese buyers. There is much we can learn from the Chi­nese and it is for us to seize the mo­ment.",南非
za,The Mercury,20190110,His­tory en­cour­ages South Africans to em­brace their past,"IF SOUTH Africa were to look to Asia it would be bet­ter off. Of­ten black peo­ple in South Africa say things like the “land was stolen from us”. Now I have to won­der if this is the truth. Not in any way to de­tract from the years of apartheid, I won­der what South Africa would be like had it not been for apartheid. Would it be rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent now? Would the crime sit­u­a­tion be bet­ter? I have some black Amer­i­can friends who seems to blame all of South Africa’s ills on whites, coloni­sa­tion and their de­stroy­ing the fab­ric of so­ci­ety. Con­quests have been hap­pen­ing since time im­memo­rial. If I look at the his­tory of China, is it any dif­fer­ence to that of South Africa? Well no, not re­ally. There were dif­fer­ent fac­tions, tribes and kings who in­vaded and counter-in­vaded over the cen­turies. If you look at his­tory on YouTube, the thing that will shock you is how many times China was in­vaded over the cen­turies. They must have built the Great Wall of China for a rea­son, right? It was to keep the in­vaders out. So what did the whites bring to South Africa? Well, for one thing the al­pha­bet. Let’s not for­get the Ro­man oc­cu­pa­tions and in­va­sions, and although around 2 000 years ago they still hap­pened. Eng­land had been ruled by other coun­tries for well over 1 300 years be­fore its own cul­ture started to emerge from the ashes mixed in and fused with the other lan­guages and cul­tures around it. English is, if any­thing, a col­lec­tion of Eu­ro­pean lan­guages and in­flu­ences which still ex­ist to­day. Did it make Eng­land stronger and more vi­brant? Ab­so­lutely, it did. From the Ro­mans to the Vik­ings, An­gloSax­ons and the Nor­man in­va­sion, Eng­land was ruled by other coun­tries for cen­turies, even mil­len­nia. South Africa is a richer place be­cause of the in­va­sions and cul­tures that helped shape it, with cul­ture and tech­nol­ogy which aided in South Africa’s rapid ad­vance. When they found gold in Jo­han­nes­burg in 1886 and it was noth­ing but a flat piece of ground, who helped to get it out of the ground? With­out money, know-how and tech­nol­ogy they would never have suc­ceeded in mak­ing Jo­han­nes­burg, and South Africa, the vi­brant place it is to­day. Did they do some things wrong? Damn sure they did. Was apartheid wrong? Ab­so­lutely. When the coun­try should have been in­te­grat­ing it was be­ing di­vided. But in­stead of throw­ing out the baby with the bath­wa­ter, I think the coun­try would do bet­ter if it em­braced its past and looked to­wards the fu­ture, where the economies grew like Sin­ga­pore’s has. If South Africa looked to­wards Asia it would be bet­ter off than look­ing to­wards the US and Europe. Asia has lifted it­self out of poverty over the last five decades and South Africa and Africa could do the same. MARTIN LEE South­east Asia",南非
za,The Star Early Edition,20151013,Fo­cus on symp­toms won’t solve poverty,"THE UBIQ­UI­TOUS “de­vel­op­ment goals” cho­sen by the UN – first Mil­len­nium (MDGs) in 2000 and now Sus­tain­able (SDGs) – were and are and will be a dis­trac­tion from the real work of fight­ing poverty done by so­cial jus­tice ac­tivists, in­clud­ing South Africans. The New York meet­ings late last month her­alded another of the an­nual UN head­sof-state sum­mits at which in­ap­pro­pri­ate tar­gets, pro­cesses and eval­u­a­tion sys­tems are re­con­firmed. Politi­cians joined mul­ti­lat­eral bu­reau­crats to con­grat­u­late each other for hit­ting many of the MDG tar­gets dur­ing the 2000-15 pe­riod. Now there are 17 new SDGs with 169 new tar­gets and more than 300 in­di­ca­tors to aim for by 2030. But since most state elites are not truly com­mit­ted to these, the big ques­tion is whether SDGs can mo­ti­vate ac­tivists work­ing in the trenches against the sys­tems of power that cre­ate poverty, hunger, dis­ease and cli­mate change. The UN, in con­trast, shies away from con­sid­er­ing or at­tribut­ing causes, pre­fer­ring to fo­cus on symp­toms. As a re­sult, the poverty-cre­at­ing and ecol­ogy-de­stroy­ing fea­tures of the world econ­omy will pro­ceed en­tirely un­hin­dered by UN hot air. Tellingly, there are no con­crete manda­tory green­house gas emis­sions-cut goals in the SDG “13 – Cli­mate ac­tion”, which sim­ply en­cour­ages the Paris UN cli­mate sum­mit in De­cem­ber to adopt vol­un­tary pledges. These are, frankly, use­less. Manda­tory cuts are vi­tal if catas­tro­phe is to be avoided. And il­lus­trat­ing the UN’s bean-count­ing con­tor­tions, the very first SDG is, “by 2030, erad­i­cate ex­treme poverty for all peo­ple ev­ery­where, cur­rently mea­sured as peo­ple liv­ing on less than $1.25 (about R16) a day”. That mea­sure comes from heart­less World Bank econ­o­mists, and gives us a 2015 world poverty count of just 1.2 bil­lion peo­ple. But what if you need not just food but min­i­mal health care, a roof over your head and cloth­ing? The UN Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment says the tar­get should be $5 a day. At one in­valu­able watchdog group, “The Rules”, Jason Hickel de­bunks: “The drafters of the SDGs know this fact. So why stick with the dis­cred­ited $1.25 mea­sure? Be­cause it’s the only one that will al­low them to get any­where near their goal of erad­i­cat­ing poverty by 2030. If we mea­sure poverty by the more ac­cu­rate $5/day line, the to­tal poverty head­count rises to 4.3 bil­lion peo­ple, more than 60 per­cent of hu­man­ity.” That’s 370 mil­lion more peo­ple than in 1990. Here in South Africa, World Bank econ­o­mists claimed late last year that at $1.25/day, ex­treme poverty rate is suf­fered by just 16.5 per­cent of our 55 mil­lion res­i­dents, half what it was be­fore con­sid­er­ing state grants to chil­dren and the el­derly. More­over, added the bank: “Thanks to ef­fec­tive use of fis­cal pol­icy to achieve re­dis­tri­bu­tion, the Gini co­ef­fi­cient on in­come falls from 0.77 to 0.59,” a fib ob­vi­ous to any­one aware of the vast state cor­po­rate wel­fare ben­e­fits bank staff brazenly ig­nored. Bank sta­tis­tics were then re­peat­edly used by a lo­cal gag­gle of ne­olib­er­als to drum-beat for greater aus­ter­ity, and so in Fe­bru­ary, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nh­lanhla Nene obliged by shrink­ing the real value of grants by 3 per­cent. Yet at the same time, a poverty rate of 53 per­cent was cal­cu­lated by Sta­tis­tics SA us­ing $1.88/day as the bare sur­vival level. A few weeks ago, Univer­sity of Cape Town re­searchers counted $2.50/day costs of 2 100 kilo­calo­ries of food and other es­sen­tial ex­pen­di­tures and reck­oned that poverty is closer to 62 per­cent. “Tor­tur­ing the data un­til they con­fess” is what ne­olib­eral poverty ex­perts ap­par­ently feel is nec­es­sary in de­fence of their dark arts. In 2006, Africa’s lead­ing po­lit­i­cal economist, Samir Amin, de­scribed MDGtalk as “in­tended to le­git­imise the poli­cies and prac­tices im­ple­mented by dom­i­nant cap­i­tal and those who sup­port it, ie in the first place, the gov­ern­ments of the triad coun­tries (US, EU and Ja­pan), and sec­on­dar­ily, gov­ern­ments in the South”. As for MDGs cut­ting ex­treme poverty and hunger by half, Amin said: “This is noth­ing but an empty in­can­ta­tion as long as the poli­cies that gen­er­ate poverty are not an­a­lysed and de­nounced and al­ter­na­tives pro­posed.” In the jour­nal Gen­der &amp; De­vel­op­ment, Caribbean, po­lit­i­cal economist Peggy Antrobus of De­vel­op­ment Al­ter­na­tives with Women for a New Era re­named MDGs “Ma­jor Dis­trac­tion Gim­micks”. For fem­i­nists, said Antrobus: “The ex­clu­sion of the goal of women’s sex­ual and re­pro­duc­tive rights re­flects the power of the forces of re­li­gious fun­da­men­tal­ism.” The MDGs’ fo­cus on the out­comes masks the process, she told an in­ter­viewer for al­liance: “We ought to be help­ing peo­ple to un­der­stand how these things are the con­se­quences of struc­tures that are pro­foundly un­just.” She said: “The cur­rent macro con­text in which these MDGs have emerged con­tains the twin de­mons of re­li­gious and eco­nomic fun­da­men­tal­ism. Both have at their core the sub­or­di­na­tion and ex­ploita­tion of women’s time, labour, and sex­u­al­ity for the ben­e­fit of pa­tri­ar­chal power on the one hand, and cap­i­tal­ism on the other.” But the point here is that cre­ative peo­ple con­stantly fight ne­olib­er­al­ism, racism, pa­tri­archy and cli­mate catas­tro­phe, even if the UN ig­nores them and their ef­forts. In our cri­tique of the Global Call to Ac­tion Against Poverty a decade ago, my col­leagues Dennis Bru­tus, Vir­ginia Set­shedi and I pointed out that its open­ing news­let­ter was silent on “or­ganic an­tipoverty ac­tivism in the Global South, such as – in no par­tic­u­lar or­der – labour strikes, pop­u­lar mo­bil­i­sa­tions for Aids-treat­ment and other health ser­vices, re­con­nec­tions of wa­ter/elec­tric­ity, land and hous­ing oc­cu­pa­tions, anti-GMO and pro-food se­cu­rity cam­paigns, women’s or­gan­is­ing, mu­nic­i­pal bud­get cam­paigns, stu­dent and youth move­ments, com­mu­nity re­sis­tance to dis­place­ments caused by dam con­struc­tion and the like, anti-debt and repa­ra­tions move­ments, en­vi­ron­men­tal jus­tice strug­gles, im­mi­grants’ rights cam­paigns, po­lit­i­cal move­ments to take state power, etc”. We con­tin­ued, in a cri­tique that ap­plies even more to the UN: “It’s as if the for­mi­da­ble re­cent up­surge of un­rest – 1980s-’90s IMF ri­ots, high-pro­file in­dige­nous peo­ple’s protests since Za­p­atismo in 1994, global jus­tice ac­tivism since Seat­tle in 1999, the So­cial Fo­rum move­ment since 2001, an­ti­war demos since 2001, au­tonomist protests and the Latin Amer­i­can left’s re­vival – never hap­pened, don’t ex­ist, aren’t wor­thy of ac­knowl­edg­ment much less in­te­gra­tion and am­pli­fi­ca­tion.” Since then, add the north African upris­ing and the Oc­cu­piers of 2011, the rise of the south­ern Euro­pean and Ir­ish left (and maybe in the UK and US too, judg­ing by elec­toral trends), the anti-race/class/re­pres­sion move­ment in the US, NGO cam­paign­ing against il­licit fi­nan­cial flows, cli­mate cam­paign­ers against ma­jor pol­luters, antiex­trac­tivist strug­gles across the south, and more re­cent mass protests against so­cioe­co­nomic in­jus­tice and au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism in Brazil, Burk­ina Faso, China, In­dia, South Africa, Tur­key and so many other sites of strug­gle. At such mo­ments, you can count on the World Bank and UN of­fi­cials to run in the other di­rec­tion. Another di­rec­tion the SDGs dare not ven­ture to­wards is ask­ing why poverty and eco­log­i­cal chaos are re­peat­edly re­pro­duced as the flip side of wealth: in short, un­even de­vel­op­ment. In “hack­ing” the SDGs, The Rules cam­paign­ers ask three un­com­fort­able ques­tions that SDGites dare not con­sider: “How is poverty cre­ated? Who’s de­vel­op­ing whom? And why is growth the only an­swer?” Hope­fully these are the ques­tions that jour­nal­ists and the gen­eral public also start ask­ing their na­tional poverty of­fi­cials. And hope­fully, the tough cri­tiques from The Rules and scholar-ac­tivists such as Amin and Antrobus are given more air time. Oth­er­wise, with­out at­ten­tion to poverty causal­ity, with­out the ac­tivists who make so­cial change pos­si­ble, and with­out in­tel­lec­tual crit­ics un­in­tim­i­dated by of­fi­cial­dom’s back-slap­ping, these SDGs are un­sus­tain­able dis­trac­tions whose def­i­ni­tions of de­vel­op­ment and en­vi­ron­ment con­tinue be­ing twisted be­yond recog­ni­tion.

za,Pretoria News,20210127,Ramaphosa calls for fair vac­cine roll-out,"PRES­I­DENT Cyril Ramaphosa has called for greater global col­lab­o­ra­tion on the roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines to en­sure that peo­ple from poorer coun­tries get vac­ci­nated. Ramaphosa spoke out against what he called vac­cine na­tion­al­i­sa­tion yes­ter­day, telling the vir­tual World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) meet­ing that the pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of na­tional in­ter­est above col­lab­o­ra­tion had led to un­equal ac­cess in the fight against a global pan­demic. Ramaphosa said that poor coun­tries had been left fac­ing long waits for their first doses as rich na­tions had gob­bled nearly all the global sup­ply of the two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cines. He said that South Africa was pro­mot­ing the need for uni­ver­sal, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines. Ramaphosa said that the global pan­demic will not end if some coun­tries were vac­ci­nat­ing while oth­ers were not. “Coro­n­avirus af­fects all of us equally, and our reme­dies and ac­tions to com­bat it must also be equal,” Ramaphosa said. “End­ing the pan­demic world­wide will re­quire greater col­lab­o­ra­tion on the roll-out of vac­cines, en­sur­ing that no coun­try is left be­hind in this ef­fort,” he said. The World Bank has re­ported that ex­treme poverty was ex­pected to rise glob­ally for the first time in more than 20 years as the dis­rup­tion caused by the pan­demic ex­ac­er­bates the ef­fects of con­flict, cli­mate change and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. A group of cam­paign­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing Amnesty In­ter­na­tional, Front­line Aids, Global Jus­tice Now and Ox­fam, also warned that 9 out of 10 peo­ple in poor coun­tries are set to miss out on Covid-19 vac­cine this year. World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO) direc­tor gen­eral Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus last week pointed out that only 25 peo­ple had been vac­ci­nated in Africa com­pared with 39 mil­lion in rich coun­tries Ghe­breye­sus said that the world was on the “brink of a cat­a­strophic moral fail­ure”. The AU has es­tab­lished a Covid-19 African Vac­cine Ac­qui­si­tion Task Team to se­cure and find sources of fund­ing for suf­fi­cient vac­cines. To date, the Task Team has se­cured a pro­vi­sional 270 mil­lion doses for African coun­tries di­rectly through vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers, in ad­di­tion to the 600 mil­lion doses ex­pected from the Co­vax ini­tia­tive. Gavi chief ex­ec­u­tive Seth F Berkley said that Co­vax wanted eq­ui­table ac­cess to the a port­fo­lio of vac­cines, to keep re­search and de­vel­op­ment go­ing, and en­sure readi­ness with reg­u­la­tory sys­tems. Co­vax is plan­ning to have 145 to 150 mil­lion doses de­liv­ered in the first quar­ter, he said. “There’s a little bit of vac­cine panic – many coun­tries want doses as of to­day – and we are do­ing our best to move things for­ward,” Berkley said. Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said the ques­tion of who re­ceived vac­ci­na­tions would cre­ate a new nar­ra­tive. “This is the hour of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism does not only mean some­how work­ing to­gether, it also means shar­ing trans­parency,” Merkel said. “We have to be hon­est that at the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic we have prob­a­bly not been as trans­par­ent as we ought to have been, for ex­am­ple the in­for­ma­tion re­leased by China as for the ori­gins of this virus and pol­icy of the WHO,” Merkel said.",南非

Song­tian, who ar­rived in SA two weeks ago, has ded­i­cated him­self to im­prov­ing diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries that are trad­ing part­ners and form part of the Brics bloc. “China puts peo­ple ahead of gov­ern­ment. We have a mantra that says ‘don’t for­get the peo­ple or you’ll be for­got­ten by the peo­ple’. “That’s why the Com­mu­nist Party of China has a pur­pose to fol­low peo­ple whole­heart­edly. You have to get ready to serve peo­ple and for­get about your­self,” he said. The for­mer am­bas­sador to Liberia and Malawi has ar­rived amid po­lit­i­cal ten­sions in the coun­try, with the ANC deeply di­vided –more than ever be­fore – and grap­pling with fac­tion­al­ism. He also ar­rives at a time when civil so­ci­ety and op­po­si­tion par­ties have cast doubt on Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma’s lead­er­ship on many oc­ca­sions, in­clud­ing in­sti­tut­ing a mo­tion of no con­fi­dence vote against him in Par­lia­ment. Song­tian pointed out that in his na­tive coun­try, lead­ers were not too con­cerned about who should lead but rather fo­cused on the task as hand – how to en­sure the coun­try is be­ing run ef­fec­tively. “We don’t have to worry about who will be pres­i­dent.

But the man who has served as the Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral for African Af­fairs in the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry noted he was not here to blast the coun­try over its poli­cies or po­lit­i­cal af­fairs. His mis­sion was to vig­or­ously fos­ter solid diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween South Africa and China dur­ing his ten­ure. Pre­sent­ing the China-Africa Ten Co-op­er­a­tion Plans geared to­wards devel­op­ment, Song­tian said one of the top pri­or­i­ties was to as­sist South Africa to cre­ate jobs and im­prove in­fra­struc­ture. Giv­ing tips on how China had emerged out of poverty to be­com­ing the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world and largest man­u­fac­turer, Song­tian said the coun­try had opened it­self up to at­tract for­eign in­vest­ment. “We have such a huge pop­u­la­tion in a poor coun­try. But ours has al­ways been to main­tain sta­bil­ity and fo­cus on eco­nomic devel­op­ment. That’s where China wants to go. “China is a coun­try sit­ting in a boat. We have 56 na­tion­al­i­ties.

We have also re­formed our­selves and have adapted to new sit­u­a­tions through our pol­icy, gov­er­nance and be­hav­iour.” Song­tian delved into the pri­or­i­ties out­lined in the African Union 2063 Agenda, say­ing China was com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing Africa’s ef­forts to break through devel­op­ment bot­tle­necks, namely in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture, lack of pro­fes­sional, skilled per­son­nel and short­ages in fi­nan­cial re­sources. Song­tian who spoke at a press brief­ing at the Chi­nese Em­bassy also used the plat­form to give a stern warn­ing to those from his coun­try in­volved in rhino poach­ing. “Il­le­gal trad­ing is pro­hib­ited. Who­ever does any­thing il­le­gal, we will come for you. When you do any­thing against the law you dam­age the im­age of China. I will never al­low you to. We will bring you to the law.” He said the em­bassy planned to launch a joint cam­paign in South Africa against il­le­gal hunt­ing of an­i­mals and trad­ing, which will in­clude a part­ner­ship with the US, the UK, In­ter­pol as well as other African coun­tries such as Kenya, Namibia and Ethiopia. “As the new am­bas­sador to South Africa it is my most im­por­tant mis­sion and core task to con­stantly deepen and en­rich the China-SA com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship. “Also, to take con­crete ac­tions to sup­port ef­forts of the South African gov­ern­ment to grow its econ­omy and im­prove peo­ple’s liveli­hoods. “We will ac­tively sup­port the ef­forts of the SA gov­ern­ment in eco­nomic and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion, through eco­nomic growth, job cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion so as to achieve uni­ver­sal in­clu­sive growth,” he said. THE De­part­ment of Higher Ed­u­ca­tion and Train­ing yes­ter­day bid farewell to 23 South African stu­dents who had been granted schol­ar­ships to study in China. The farewell cer­e­mony was held at the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Pre­to­ria, and one of the stu­dents head­ing to China was No­math­am­saqa Maimela, from Mon­u­ment Park. Maimela said she had a Mas­ters in home­opa­thy and would be study­ing to­wards a PhD in on­col­ogy at the Huazhong Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy. “When I re­ceived the fi­nal con­fir­ma­tion that I was go­ing, the feel­ing was out of this world. This is very ex­cit­ing,” she said. She would be in China for three years and was thrilled about the pro­gramme she would be study­ing, she said. Maimela said af­ter com­plet­ing her qual­i­fi­ca­tion she would re­turn home, open up a few clin­ics in the town­ship and make med­i­cal cen­tres ac­ces­si­ble to the com­mu­nity. “A lot of stu­dents study abroad and re­ceive bet­ter of­fers and end up work­ing in West­ern so­ci­eties, whereas our own coun­try needs us the most. I will def­i­nitely come back as soon as I fin­ish my PhD and make a dif­fer­ence in our coun­try.” With a sup­port­ive fam­ily be­hind her, she be­lieved she could achieve a lot. “I have been told os­are tlisetsa mo-China (do not bring us a Chi­nese hus­band) and that I am too tall for a Chi­nese man but other than that, my fam­ily is very sup­port­ive and happy for me,” she quipped. Tsh­wane Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy (TUT) lec­turer and re­searcher Lizl Steyn­berg, who will be study­ing to­wards a PhD in tech­nol­ogy econ­omy and man­age­ment at the He­bei Prov­ince Uni­ver­sity of Tech­nol­ogy, said: “I’ve been to China be­fore. My time there will be to en­hance a vi­brant re­la­tion­ship be­tween South Africa and China.” Steyn­berg said she would leave on Septem­ber 5, adding that she would be ac­com­pa­nied by Por­tia Tladi, also from the uni­ver­sity. Tladi, TUT’s man­age­ment sci­ences re­search of­fi­cer from Hart­beespoort, will be study­ing to­wards a PhD in busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion at the Harbin In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy. She would be leav­ing her 15-yearold son Obak­eng be­hind and said it was the most heart­break­ing thing for her. “It is heart­break­ing but he knows this is good for the fu­ture of both of us,” she said. She too would be in China for three years. Chi­nese Am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian told the stu­dents they were wel­come to stay in China. The coun­try was very safe and boasted am­ple his­tory and a cul­ture to learn from, he said. He re­minded them to main­tain dis­ci­pline and re­mem­ber why they were there, to study and for the con­tri­bu­tion they would need to make when they re­turned. The De­part­ment of Higher Ed­u­ca­tion and Train­ing’s Ghaleeb Jep­pie also wished the stu­dents well. Schol­ar­ships were given to stu­dents fo­cused in ar­eas of short­age, such as agri­cul­tural eco­nomics, man­age­ment and en­gi­neer­ing, he said.",南非
za,Cape Argus,20151201,Sum­mit will foster friendly eco­nomic and so­cial ties,"THE FO­RUM on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) sum­mit to be held in Joburg on Fri­day and Satur­day, will set the next agenda for Sino-Africa bi­lat­eral ties and strengthen part­ner­ship in new ar­eas of mu­tual ben­e­fit, said the am­bas­sador of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC) to Kenya, Liu Xianfa. Liu said the sum­mit would prove a wa­ter­shed mo­ment for the PRC and Africa as they charted a new, broad, agenda for co­op­er­a­tion. Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and dozens of African lead­ers will at­tend the sum­mit, which has his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance, ac­cord­ing to Liu. “State lead­ers from China and Africa will jointly dis­cuss mea­sures to strengthen the link­age of China-Africa de­vel­op­ment strate­gies, and in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion,” said Liu, adding that the theme of the sum­mit “Africa-China Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment” in­di­cated com­mon goals. Since the in­cep­tion of Focac in 2000, Sino-African bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion has flour­ished due to good­will on both sides, said Liu. He noted that Sino-Africa co­op­er­a­tion has grown, par­tic­u­larly in the ar­eas of trade, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, in­dus­try, tech­nol­ogy and peo­pleto-peo­ple ex­changes. “Sta­tis­tics in­di­cate that in 2014, trade be­tween China and Africa ex­ceeded $220 bil­lion and China’s in­vest­ment stock in Africa sur­passed $30bn,” Liu said. Beijing is the lead­ing source of for­eign direct in­vest­ment in Africa’s eco­nomic re­nais­sance, Liu claimed. He said in­vest­ments by Chi­nese firms in Africa had helped to al­le­vi­ate en­demic African poverty and un­em­ploy­ment. “Chi­nese com­pa­nies have in­vested in var­i­ous fields such as fi­nance, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion, en­ergy, man­u­fac­tur­ing and agri­cul­ture, thus cre­at­ing more than 100 000 lo­cal jobs,” said the en­voy. The PRC has pro­vided fi­nance and tech­ni­cal skills to help bridge Africa’s in­fra­struc­ture deficit, Liu said. By Septem­ber, about 5 675km of rail­ways and 4 507km of roads had been built or were un­der con­struc­tion in Africa thanks to Chi­nese fi­nan­cial sup­port, he said. Sino-Africa bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion had also flour­ished in health, agri­cul­ture, arts and cul­ture, Liu said. The PRC had helped to re­solve con­flicts and pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, he said. Liu claimed that the PRC had dis­patched the largest num­ber of peace­keep­ing troops to African hotspots. He also said that the PRC had helped to build new schools and hos­pi­tals.” The PRC also took a lead­ing role in help­ing Africa fight the Ebola epi­demic and was in­volved in re­search for new anti-malar­ial medicines, he said. The up­com­ing Focac sum­mit will pro­vide a plat­form for po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, pol­i­cy­mak­ers and schol­ars from both the PRC and Africa to re­vi­talise part­ner­ships, said Liu. He said that the PRC and its African al­lies shared a com­mon past and des­tiny, adding that the Focac sum­mit would en­dorse new mea­sures to ac­cel­er­ate so­cio-eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion in Africa. “China is will­ing to es­tab­lish three de­vel­op­ment sys­tems in Africa that pro­mote the pro­cess­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try, food se­cu­rity and pub­lic health.” “China will lever­age the ad­van­tages of China-Africa po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust and eco­nomic com­ple­men­tar­ily to help break Africa’s twin de­vel­op­ment bot­tle­necks of in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture and hu­man re­sources.” – ANA",南非
za,Cape Argus,20190205,Does SA’s po­si­tion on Venezuela mat­ter?,"SOUTH Africa can be pi­geon-holed as an ex-British colony and a for­mer apartheid state. Its pol­i­tics is ide­o­log­i­cally in­con­sis­tent. The fact that South Africa was once colonised by the British had an im­pact on the man­ner in which the apartheid gov­ern­ment or­gan­ised it­self. They used the fact that Bri­tain and the US were against com­mu­nism to mo­bilise sup­port from the two coun­tries. In ad­di­tion, the ANC was as­so­ci­ated with Rus­sia and com­mu­nism. This also meant the ANC was the en­emy of democ­racy and cap­i­tal­ism. More so, the apartheid gov­ern­ment em­pha­sised this, know­ing the West would per­ceive the ANC as their ad­ver­sary. In 1994, com­mu­nism was never in­tro­duced, at least for­mally. The ANC chose to use some of the prin­ci­ples of com­mu­nism or so­cial­ism per se, such as pro­vid­ing free houses, ed­u­ca­tion and so­cial grants. It is worth high­light­ing that while pro-cap­i­tal­ists say the ANC-led gov­ern­ment is noth­ing but a sub­tle form of com­mu­nism, those at the bot­tom of the food chain be­lieve its emer­gence to power brought noth­ing but cap­i­tal­ism. South Africa is now a two-in-one coun­try pulling in dif­fer­ent directions. Those who ben­e­fited (white South Africans) are mostly in sup­port of cap­i­tal­ism, since their lives flour­ished un­der cap­i­tal­ism and con­tinue to do so. In con­trast, those who con­tinue to linger in poverty (mostly black South Africans) be­lieve the ANC has sold out to the cap­i­tal­ists. The line be­tween sup­port­ing com­mu­nism for the pur­pose of el­e­vat­ing the poor and sup­port­ing cor­rup­tion has proven to be thin in the case of the ANC. Thus, their sup­port for Venezuela’s Ni­co­las Maduro is quite con­cern­ing in as much as the pro­posed coup (or regime change) by the US is. Venezuela un­der Maduro has im­ple­mented some ap­peal­ing eco­nomic poli­cies, such as the tak­ing of the land and giv­ing it to the poor. Such a move has led to crit­i­cism by the pro­po­nents of pri­vate prop­erty rights. Venezuela is now in tat­ters due to heavy sanc­tions by the US and EU. These sanc­tions are based on the un­der­stand­ing that Maduro’s gov­ern­ment has in­fringed upon hu­man rights, si­lenced the me­dia and there have been re­ports of po­lit­i­cal in­tol­er­ance. The con­se­quences of Maduro’s so­cial­ist regime has some­how led to the preva­lence of ex­ces­sive poverty. The US (sup­ported by Bri­tain) has a bad record of top­pling gov­ern­ments and leav­ing the coun­tries in ru­ins while ex­tract­ing their nat­u­ral re­sources. Thus, it is not clear as to whether the US and its al­lies are con­cerned with the state of democ­racy in Venezuela or the aim is to get to the oil re­serves. Rus­sia is against the pro­posed regime change. South Africa is not the only coun­try in sup­port of Maduro. How­ever, Rus­sia is eco­nom­i­cally stronger than South Africa, which re­lies on in­vest­ment from the West. Hence, South Africa can be eas­ily swayed into agree­ing or vot­ing with the US in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. South Africa’s po­si­tion is un­for­tu­nately in the hands of the West, since the coun­try is eco­nom­i­cally de­pen­dent on their trade. This is not to un­der­mine the fact that South Africa does trade with China and Rus­sia. None­the­less, the West still plays a sig­nif­i­cant role in shap­ing the econ­omy.",南非

za,The Citizen (KZN),20191016,Oo­dles of noo­dle is­sues,"Manila – A diet heavy on cheap, mod­ern food like in­stant noo­dles that fills bel­lies but lacks key nu­tri­ents has left mil­lions of chil­dren un­healthily thin or over­weight in south­east Asia, ex­perts say. The Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Malaysia have boom­ing economies and ris­ing stan­dards of liv­ing, yet many work­ing par­ents do not have the time, money or aware­ness to steer clear of food hurt­ing their kids. In those three na­tions, an av­er­age of 40% of chil­dren aged five and be­low are mal­nour­ished, higher than the global av­er­age of one-in-three, ac­cord­ing to a re­port out yes­ter­day from Unicef, the UN chil­dren’s agency. “Par­ents be­lieve that fill­ing their chil­dren’s stom­ach is the most im­por­tant thing. They don’t re­ally think about an ad­e­quate in­take of pro­tein, cal­cium or fi­bre,” Has­bul­lah Thabrany, a pub­lic health ex­pert in In­done­sia, said. Unicef said the harm done to chil­dren was both a symp­tom of past de­pri­va­tion and a pre­dic­tor of fu­ture poverty, while iron de­fi­ciency im­paired a child’s abil­ity to learn and raised a woman’s risk of death dur­ing or shortly af­ter child­birth. To give some sense of scale to the prob­lem, In­done­sia had 24.4 mil­lion chil­dren un­der five last year, while the Philip­pines had 11 mil­lion and Malaysia 2.6 mil­lion, Unicef data showed. Mueni Mu­tunga, Unicef Asia nu­tri­tion spe­cial­ist, traced the trend back to fam­i­lies ditch­ing tra­di­tional di­ets for af­ford­able, easy-to-pre­pare “mod­ern” meals. Noo­dles are low on es­sen­tial nu­tri­ents and mi­cronu­tri­ents like iron and are also pro­tein-de­fi­cient while hav­ing high fat and salt con­tent, Mu­tunga added. In­done­sia was the world’s sec­ond-big­gest con­sumer of in­stant noo­dles, be­hind China, with 12.5 bil­lion serv­ings last year, ac­cord­ing to the World In­stant Noo­dles As­so­ci­a­tion. This is more than the to­tal con­sumed by In­dia and Ja­pan put to­gether. Nu­tri­ent-rich fruits, veg­eta­bles, eggs, dairy, fish and meat are dis­ap­pear­ing from di­ets as the ru­ral pop­u­la­tion moves to the cities in search of jobs, the Unicef re­port said. Though the Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Malaysia are all mid­dle-in­come coun­tries by World Bank mea­sures, tens of mil­lions of their peo­ple strug­gle to make enough money to live. “Poverty is the key is­sue,” said T Jaya­balan, a pub­lic health ex­pert in Malaysia, ad­ding that house­holds where both par­ents work need quickly made meals. Low-in­come house­holds in Malaysia de­pended largely on noo­dles, sweet pota­toes and soya-based prod­ucts for ma­jor meals, he said. Rolling back the in­flu­ence in­stant nod­dles have on the lives, and health, of south­east Asians will likely re­quire gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion, ex­perts said. Thabrany added: “There is mas­sive dis­tri­bu­tion. In­stant noo­dles are avail­able ev­ery­where.”",南非
za,Pretoria News,20150414,China set to be world’s No1 pol­luter,"CHINA is poised to over­take the US as the main cause of man-made global warm­ing since 1990, the bench­mark year for UN-led ac­tion, in a his­toric shift that may raise pres­sure on Bei­jing to act. China’s cu­mu­la­tive green­house gas emis­sions since 1990, when govern­ments were be­com­ing aware of cli­mate change, will out­strip those of the US this year or 2016, ac­cord­ing to sep­a­rate es­ti­mates by ex­perts in Nor­way and the US. The shift, re­flect­ing China’s stel­lar eco­nomic growth, raises ques­tions about his­tor­i­cal blame for ris­ing tem­per­a­tures and more floods, de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion, heat­waves and the rise in sea lev­els. Al­most 200 na­tions will meet in Paris in De­cem­ber to work out a global deal to fight cli­mate change be­yond 2020. “A few years ago China’s per capita emis­sions were low, its his­tor­i­cal re­spon­si­bil­ity was low. That’s chang­ing fast,” said Glen Pe­ters of the Cen­tre for In­ter­na­tional Cli­mate and En­vi­ron­men­tal Re­search, Oslo (Cicero), who says China will over­take the US this year. Us­ing slightly dif­fer­ent data, the US-based World Re­sources In­sti­tute think-tank es­ti­mated that China’s cu­mu­la­tive car­bon diox­ide emis­sions will to­tal 151 bil­lion tons for 1990-2016, over­tak­ing the US to­tal of 147 bil­lion next year. The rise of cu­mu­la­tive emis­sions “ob­vi­ously does open China up to claims of re­spon­si­bil­ity from other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries”, said Daniel Far­ber, a pro­fes­sor of law at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley. In a UN prin­ci­ple laid down in 1992, rich na­tions are meant to lead in cut­ting green­house gas emis­sions be­cause their wealth is based on burn­ing coal, oil and nat­u­ral gas since the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion be­gan in the 18th cen­tury. Emerg­ing na­tions, mean­while, can burn more fos­sil fu­els to catch up and end poverty. But the rapid eco­nomic rise of China, In­dia, Brazil and many other emerg­ing na­tions is strain­ing the tra­di­tional di­vide be­tween rich and poor. “All coun­tries now have re­spon­si­bil­ity. It’s not just a story about China – it’s a story about the whole world,” said Ottmar Eden­hofer of the Pots­dam In­sti­tute for Cli­mate Im­pact Re­search and co-chair­man of a UN cli­mate re­port last year. In­dia will over­take Rus­sia’s cu­mu­la­tive emis­sions since 1990 in the 2020s to rank fourth be­hind China, the US and the Euro­pean Union, ac­cord­ing to the Cicero cal­cu­la­tions. China sur­passed the US as the top an­nual emit­ter of car­bon diox­ide in about 2006 and now emits more each year than the US and the EU com­bined. Per capita emis­sions by its 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple are around EU lev­els. Bei­jing says the best yard­stick for his­tor­i­cal re­spon­si­bil­ity is per capita emis­sions since the 18th cen­tury, by which mea­sure its emis­sions are less than a 10th those of the US.

za,Weekend Argus (Sunday Edition),20150118,Tech­nol­ogy can help mil­lions tran­scend poverty,"Since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, there has been an ex­plo­sion of en­trepreneur­ship around the world. Asian coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly In­dia and China, have demon­strated their abil­ity to cre­ate high-growth start-ups. Around the world, there are 70 or so pri­vate en­ter­prises val­ued at above $1 bil­lion (R11.5bn), and Asia is home to 15 of them. But most of th­ese ven­tures are prod­ucts of hor­i­zon­tal progress (go­ing “from one to n”, to use Thiel’s ex­pres­sion) and not ver­ti­cal progress (“from zero to one”). Strictly speak­ing, even in­ter­net gi­ants such as China’s Alibaba Group and In­dia’s Flip­kart are not tech­nol­ogy pi­o­neers: their well-earned suc­cess has been in de­ploy­ing and scal­ing a proven business model in their home mar­ket. So far, China, In­dia and other emerg­ing mar­kets have grown by adopt­ing and adapt­ing tech­nolo­gies and business mod­els from ad­vanced economies. But can eco­nomic growth be sus­tained and de­liv­ered through the glob­al­i­sa­tion model alone? Large pop­u­la­tions in Asia and Africa as­pire to join the ranks of the mid­dle class; bring­ing sus­tain­abil­ity to so many peo­ple will take in­no­va­tion across a wide range of in­dus­tries, which have so far re­mained rel­a­tively un­touched by the rapid pace of change af­fect­ing in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nolo­gies (ICT). There is an enor­mous amount of la­tent con­sumer de­mand across the de­vel­op­ing world that will be dif­fi­cult to meet with­out in­no­va­tion. Con­sider the chal­lenges in en­ergy, health care and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, for ex­am­ple. En­ergy and power re­quire­ments are so enor­mous that meet­ing them with fos­sil fuel-based tech­nolo­gies would re­sult in se­ri­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, as China’s ex­pe­ri­ence is prov­ing. In health care, large sec­tions of the poor are be­ing priced out of the mar­ket for life- sav­ing drugs, and the in­dus­try re­quires a more cost-ef­fec­tive drug-de­vel­op­ment model, as well as new gov­ern­ment wel­fare mech­a­nisms to de­liver medicines to the bot­tom of the pyra­mid, with­out violating in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights of drug in­no­va­tors. In fi­nance, tens of mil­lions of peo­ple re­main with­out bank ac­counts and are cut off from the for­mal fi­nan­cial sys­tem. Rapidly evolv­ing crypto-cur­rency tech­nolo­gies such as the Bit­coin (com­bined with in­ter­net-en­abled smart­phones) can help widen fi­nan­cial ac­cess. The scale of need across th­ese and other in­dus­tries is such that the glob­al­i­sa­tion ap­proach alone is not suf­fi­cient: new tech­nol­ogy is ur­gently re­quired. En­trepreneurs have to de­liver in­no­va­tions in mul­ti­ple sec­tors, not just ICT-re­lated in­dus­tries, to be able to make a large-scale im­pact. Fi­nally, it is more dif­fi­cult for en­trepreneurs and in­vestors in ad­vanced economies to de­liver such in­no­va­tions be­cause they are not close to the cus­tomer. In­creas­ingly, en­trepreneurs in emerg­ing mar­kets will need to take the ini­tia­tive and at­tempt to do what no­body has done, be­cause the prob­lems in th­ese mar­kets will be prob­lems that no­body has re­ally solved be­fore. Ad­di­tion­ally, th­ese will be prob­lems that ad­vanced economies don’t re­ally have a stake in solv­ing. In other words, emerg­ing-mar­ket en­trepreneurs will need to think of how to go “from zero to one” in a myr­iad of in­dus­tries if they are to de­liver sus­tain­able and eq­ui­table growth for their large do­mes­tic pop­u­la­tions. It poses a se­ri­ous risk for global eco­nomic growth, but also presents the en­tre­pre­neur­ial op­por­tu­nity of the cen­tury. In­no­va­tors who square the cir­cle will not only cre­ate sub­stan­tial wealth; they will also have done a tremen­dous ser­vice to so­ci­ety by help­ing the tran­si­tion out of poverty for mil­lions.

za,Pretoria News,20200422,Egypt sends sup­plies to US,"AN A C-130 mil­i­tary air­craft loaded with med­i­cal sup­plies from Egypt was sched­uled to land at Dulles In­ter­na­tional Air­port yes­ter­day to help fight the coro­n­avirus, a US of­fi­cial said, a ges­ture meant to show sup­port for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and the US-Egypt al­liance. The sup­plies, ac­cord­ing to a log provided by Mike Evans, a Texas writer and Chris­tian ac­tivist who has ad­vised Trump and met fre­quently with Mid­dleeast­ern lead­ers in­clud­ing Egyp­tian Pres­i­dent Abdel-Fat­tah el-Sisi, in­clude anaes­the­sia drugs and an­tibi­otics as well as body bags, masks and test­ing swabs. Evans called the ship­ments “hu­man­i­tar­ian aid” to the coun­try of a pres­i­dent who Sisi highly re­spects. The ship­ments were the lat­est from Egypt to coun­tries in the West, and fol­low gifts to Italy and Bri­tain. They also come a few days af­ter Egypt re­ceived four tons of med­i­cal pro­tec­tive sup­plies from China to help it fight the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to the Egyp­tian Health Min­istry. The aid was the first in a se­ries of ship­ments, said Chi­nese am­bas­sador to Cairo Liao Liqiang. “Does Egypt re­ally have enough of these things to be giv­ing them away or ex­port­ing them?” asked Michele Dunne, di­rec­tor of the Mid­dle East pro­gramme at the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace. She noted re­ports that there have been out­breaks of the virus in some Egyp­tian hos­pi­tals, and some drug hoard­ing. A third of Egypt’s pop­u­la­tion of more than 100 mil­lion peo­ple live in ex­treme poverty. “Egypt giv­ing away or ex­port­ing aid will cause con­cern or even re­sent­ment in­side Egypt,” Dunne said. “What el-Sisi is do­ing with gifts or sales is to show he’s on top of Covid-19 in­side Egypt and he wants to build up some of his im­por­tant re­la­tion­ships.” The coro­n­avirus death rate in Egypt is more than 7%, Egypt To­day re­ported on Sun­day, cit­ing the coun­try’s health min­is­ter. Ac­cord­ing to the web­site of the US Em­bassy in Egypt, as of Sun­day there were 3 144 con­firmed cases. The Ital­ian en­ergy gi­ant Eni is work­ing with Egypt on de­vel­op­ing a mas­sive nat­u­ral gas field in the Mediter­ranean, said Michael Wahid Hanna at the Cen­tury Foun­da­tion. Egyp­tian of­fi­cials have por­trayed the med­i­cal ship­ments as friendly ges­tures be­tween Egypt and these na­tions in light of their his­tor­i­cal al­liances.

za,Daily News,20151106,We need to keep kids safe at school,"IN THE wake of matrics writ­ing their fi­nal ex­ams, I can­not help but be con­cerned when I read about teach­ers sex­u­ally as­sault­ing pupils. Re­cently the South African Coun­cil of Ed­u­ca­tors tabled its re­port about teacher mis­con­duct in Par­lia­ment, three days later a pupil from a Jo­han­nes­burg school was al­legedly sex­u­ally as­saulted by a teacher who tried to rape her. In my opin­ion, all sex­ual preda­tors should be dealt the harsh­est pos­si­ble pun­ish­ment. As a par­ent, you get to know your child’s teach­ers and, af­ter a while, you start to feel con­tent in the knowl­edge that your child is safe while at school. Un­til the un­think­able hap­pens and your child starts los­ing the zeal and pos­i­tive out­look on life that goes with be­ing at school. When chil­dren have been sex­u­ally abused, they start los­ing fo­cus, they be­come with­drawn, anx­ious, de­pressed, and start be­hav­ing dif­fer­ently – they be­come ag­gres­sive, which goes hand-in­hand with prob­lems re­lat­ing to sleep­ing and eat­ing dis­or­ders and many other dis­or­ders, in­clud­ing abus­ing drugs, al­co­hol, self-harm and hav­ing sui­ci­dal ten­den­cies. Ed­u­ca­tion is the ba­sic and es­sen­tial fac­tor in help­ing to sus­tain so­ci­eties. If our chil­dren feel threat­ened by go­ing to a learn­ing in­sti­tu­tion of any kind for the bet­ter­ment of them­selves and to add value to their com­mu­ni­ties, par­ents should be hell­bent on want­ing to nur­ture and not harm our young peo­ple. To be recog­nised for who they are, our young peo­ple should be given op­por­tu­ni­ties and not have their abil­i­ties stunted by preda­tors of any kind as they face chal­lenges to trans­form our world to be­come a bet­ter place. Let’s all stand to­gether and keep our chil­dren safe. RIANNA WENTZEL Grassy Park Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma and Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi of In­dia be­fore the start of their bi­lat­eral meet­ing at Hy­der­abad House in New Delhi, In­dia, last month. CHINA is woo­ing Africa and is now joined by In­dia – and their strong in­flu­ence is felt. In­dia to­day is the fastest grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy, hav­ing made strides in ev­ery sphere of life in the past 20 years or so. While the two gi­ants are im­prov­ing the economies of their coun­tries, they can­not keep pace, par­tic­u­larly In­dia with the big­gest pop­u­la­tion in the world, to pro­vide a bet­ter life for its mil­lions of poor. They live in ab­ject poverty and there is mas­sive un­em­ploy­ment. Those liv­ing in squalid con­di­tions have given up hope of ever see­ing a bet­ter life. Chil­dren at the age of 8 and 10 are put to work earn­ing a mea­gre salary. More than 363 mil­lion live be­low the poverty line. In­dia, like China, is af­ter nat­u­ral resources. In­dia is in talks with South Africa to buy coal mines pro­duc­ing up to 90 mil­lion tons of cook­ing coal each year to feed its grow­ing steel industry. South Africa is al­ready a ma­jor coal sup­plier to In­dia. Nev­er­the­less, it must be said that part­ner­ship with In­dia and China is fo­cused on ex­ploita­tion – they will ben­e­fit but South Africa will not. South Africa is one of the part­ners of Brics, and the ANC gov­ern­ment has trans­ferred a large amount of tax­pay­ers money into the Brics trea­sury, but we have not seen any re­turn so far. Presently our coun­try is go­ing through financial and eco- nomic dif­fi­cul­ties as spelled out by Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nonhlanla Nene. I do not think stay­ing on with Brics will be of ben­e­fit to us, but the other part­ners will greatly ben­e­fit by im­prov­ing their economies. Why spend bil­lions in South Africa and Africa, when In­dia and China can spend it at home to im­prove the qual­ity of life of their peo­ple? Pres­i­dent Zuma was quick to cre­ate a part­ner­ship with Brics, but I be­lieve it was not a wise move. Sooner or later, it will be dis­cov­ered that South Africa is not ben­e­fit­ing as ex­pected, while the other part­ners thrive. ISMAIL M MOOLLA uMz­into",南非

za,The Star Early Edition,20191002,Build­ing a con­ti­nent that is in­clu­sive,"THE World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa meet­ing in South Africa re­cently was dom­i­nated by a sideshow: acts of xeno­pho­bic vi­o­lence were spread­ing from Gaut­eng into other prov­inces and across borders. The tense at­mos­phere was fur­ther height­ened by the coun­try mourn­ing the grue­some mur­der of UCT stu­dent, Uyinene Mr­wetyana. The dream of many Pan-African­ist thinkers of a united Africa re­mains a far-off, but pos­si­ble dream. But what­ever hope re­mains is go­ing up in smoke un­less de­ci­sive lead­er­ship, which un­for­tu­nately seems to be lack­ing, brings the vi­o­lence to an abrupt end. The at­tack on African for­eign na­tion­als in South Africa is a re­flec­tion of an Africa that has not yet found its own iden­tity. In 2008, the coun­try wit­nessed at­tacks and killings of for­eign na­tion­als in which 62 peo­ple, in­clud­ing 23 South Africans, lost their lives. Since then many the­o­ries have been given and much re­search has been con­ducted in search of not only the rea­sons but also so­lu­tions for this phe­nom­ena. Some of the rea­sons posited in­clude lack of em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, al­leged il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties and sell­ing of fake goods. Sur­pris­ingly, the waves of vi­o­lence do not af­fect Euro­pean and other East Asia peo­ple (In­dia, China, Ja­pan) who are also among for­eign na­tion­als liv­ing in South Africa. Re­ly­ing not just on the SARB data de­tail­ing the lack of trust, we need to dig deeper and make sense of why South Africans treat for­eign na­tion­als dif­fer­ently while the lev­els of dis­trust are sim­i­lar. In my opin­ion, we have not yet found what unites us as Africans and we fo­cus on what makes us dif­fer­ent. Part of the prob­lem is that as South Africans we put our­selves on a pedestal based on the idea that South Africa has over­come apartheid, has a func­tion­ing democ­racy and a strong econ­omy that some­how makes us su­pe­rior. There is a sense of look­ing down on other Africans as peo­ple who are not en­ti­tled to pro­tec­tion and free­dom that our con­sti­tu­tion af­fords ev­ery­one in South Africa. Our his­tory of colo­nial­ism and apartheid con­di­tioned us to think that if a per­son is black and poor they should not be af­forded their full in­her­ent hu­man dig­nity. Cou­pled with poverty and unem­ploy­ment the sense of su­pe­ri­or­ity is height­ened by a no­tion that for­eign­ers are also tak­ing away eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties. What we all know as black Africans is that struc­tural poverty and vi­o­lent sys­tems of colo­nial­ism and apartheid were and are still af­fect­ing us. As vic­tims of such crimes against hu­man­ity, we should mo­bilise and unite to­wards an Africa that is at peace with it­self so that we can build an Africa that is in­clu­sive, demo­cratic and fair for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. We need to tell our sto­ries to each other, find our shared iden­tity and start to build an Africa that is one. Kwame Nkrumah rightly states, “The forces that unite us are in­trin­sic and greater than the su­per­im­posed in­flu­ences that keep us apart.”",南非

za,Cape Times,20190103,Let’s care­fully ap­ply our minds to African trends,"WHAT kind of a year should Africans ex­pect? What do trends from 2018 tell us about what we can log­i­cally and rea­son­ably ex­pect of 2019? It is pos­si­ble to look closely at last year’s trends in order to an­tic­i­pate the state of the con­ti­nent this year. This is partly be­cause trends in African pol­i­tics and eco­nomics do not start and end with years but tend to spill over from year to year. It is be­cause real trends in Africa are of a long-term na­ture. If the DRC con­tin­ues with its elec­toral and post-elec­toral vi­o­lence, then South­ern and Cen­tral Africa are likely to feel the im­pact es­pe­cially if this vi­o­lence is pro­tracted. Sim­i­larly, a peace­ful post-elec­toral en­vi­ron­ment marked by na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and so­cial co­he­sion will likely au­gur well for the en­tire re­gion. The fact that Zim­babwe averted a full cri­sis af­ter a coup in 2017 helped pre­vent a melt­down in South­ern Africa. The one good rea­son why we must ap­ply our minds to trends for this year is that it is bet­ter to an­tic­i­pate than to re­spond to devel­op­ments af­ter the fact. This ap­plies equally to lead­ers of econ­omy, pol­i­tics and so­ci­ety as it does to thinkers, com­men­ta­tors and ac­tivists. It is good to heed an an­cient African proverb that main­tains: “Even if it drowned your child, you will still need wa­ter.” That need for us to an­tic­i­pate means that even if things don’t al­ways work in our favour, hope should still re­side in us at all times. The first ma­jor cur­rent trend we are tak­ing into 2019 is go­ing to be the dis-junc­ture be­tween pos­i­tive growth rates and low lev­els of devel­op­ment. Many economies are among high growth cases but poverty re­mains rooted in our so­ci­eties. Growth with­out jobs trans­lates to an im­pov­er­ished qual­ity of life. An­other chal­lenge is the over-re­liance on the good­ness of big and pop­u­lar lead­ers at the ex­pense of in­sti­tu­tions. The for­tunes of many coun­tries still hang on lead­ers who hold things to­gether as in Rwanda and Gabon or who let things fall apart as in Cameroon and Bu­rundi. While there is a de­cline in the in­ci­dence of wars there is also a rise of in­ternecine vi­o­lence that comes in dif­fer­ent forms such as com­mu­nal, pas­toral, elec­tion-re­lated and gen­der-based vi­o­lence. These are trends we need to care­fully watch es­pe­cially in the Sa­hel and other semi-arid ar­eas. Lack of so­cial part­ner­ships that bind to­gether the state, civil so­ci­ety and busi­ness re­main a com­mon prob­lem. This robs coun­tries like Chad, Mada­gas­car and Su­dan of so­cial co­he­sion nec­es­sary to plot a way out of low growth, high de­spair and an ex­ter­nal de­pen­dency trap. Re­source de­pen­dency like over-re­liance on one or two eco­nomic sec­tors deep­ens the age-old prob­lem of a nar­row base of eco­nomic pro­duc­tion. Un­der these con­di­tions, economies are un­able to of­fer path­ways out of poverty and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Coun­tries like the DRC and Congo Braz­zav­ille over-rely on abun­dant re­sources, whose ex­ploita­tion is not gov­erned The one good rea­son is that it is bet­ter to an­tic­i­pate than to re­spond to devel­op­ments af­ter the fact SIPHAMANDLA ZONDI Univer­sity of Pre­to­ria well and as a re­sult, the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple re­main mired in poverty. If we don’t fix the chal­lenges that be­set us, re­gional in­te­gra­tion and con­ti­nen­tal in­te­gra­tion will re­main rhetoric and mere sum­mit as it is un­likely that states will this time de­cide to cede some sovereignty to re­gional in­sti­tu­tions in order to enable them to make and pur­sue a firm de­ci­sion on in­te­gra­tion. The laud­able “Africa We Want Plan” geared to­wards Agenda 2063 will re­main a com­mit­ment in prin­ci­ple and not in prac­tice. Un­der the cur­rent con­di­tions, the young will con­tinue to move from out­ly­ing ar­eas to the al­ready con­gested cities to eke out a liv­ing. With this comes grow­ing des­ti­tu­tion, dis­con­tent and dis­il­lu­sion­ment. In these cur­rent con­di­tions, ter­ror­ism and crim­i­nal­ity thrive. Young peo­ple will con­tinue to un­der­take those per­ilous trips across the Sa­hara Desert and across the Mediter­ranean Sea in search of ba­sic liv­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the more pros­per­ous con­ti­nent of Europe. The trends we have seen thus far such as the change of lead­er­ship style with the emer­gence of the likes of Joao Manuel Lourenzo in An­gola, Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Ge­orge Weah of Liberia and Emer­son Mnan­gagwa of Zim­babwe per­haps sig­nals a new crop of lead­ers who may po­ten­tially bring about the wave of change African coun­tries so des­per­ately need. The ex­ter­nal fac­tor is also key to Africa’s plight. The sup­port from China is per­haps the big­gest game changer from out­side fol­lowed by grow­ing investment from other emerg­ing economies that range from Qatar to Turkey to In­dia and Brazil. But the ri­valry be­tween the US and China and Rus­sia will af­fect Africa in var­i­ous ways in 2019. This is be­cause Africa’s strate­gic in­ter­ests will be made sec­ondary to those of these big pow­ers fight­ing their own bat­tles on African soil. But we need a birth of new cit­i­zens, new cit­i­zens move­ments and new ac­tivism that will back up those lead­ers who are bold enough to en­sure a bet­ter life for all and new cit­i­zens who will play a watch­dog role over all those who are in author­ity. The Africa of 2019 is not the only one filled with chal­lenges and prospects of change and con­ti­nu­ity but also prospects of pit­falls. This year will de­pend on what cit­i­zens and lead­ers are pre­pared to do to har­ness the spirit of unity and so­cial co­he­sion in order to move Africa closer to the idea of a bet­ter life for all.",南非
za,Cape Argus,20151019,Bet­ter in­fra­struc­ture can break the cy­cle of ru­ral poverty,"GOOD news seems hard to find nowa­days given the con­stant flow of re­port­ing on war, refugees, bloop­ers by pres­i­dents and cor­po­rate scan­dals. While I am not a pro­po­nent of calls for a pos­i­tive news net­work, we are over­look­ing one of the most im­por­tant events of our time. This is to be found in a longer term per­spec­tive on the global in­ci­dence of ex­treme poverty, il­lit­er­acy and dis­ease that has showed an in­cred­i­ble de­cline since the 1990s. Glob­ally, the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing in ex­treme poverty, de­fined as per­sons who sur­vive on less than $1.25 a day by the World Bank, has de­creased from 43 to 17 per­cent dur­ing the pe­riod 1991 to 2011 (more re­cent un­of­fi­cial data puts the cur­rent fig­ure closer to 10 per­cent). Dur­ing this 20-year pe­riod the num­ber of chil­dren who die be­fore the age of 5 de­creased by 50 per­cent and the num­ber of girls who com­plete el­e­men­tary school in the de­vel­op­ing world has risen to 80 per­cent of their age co­hort. Much of this suc­cess can be at­trib­uted to East Asia (China, In­done­sia, Viet­nam, etc) where the por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion who live in ex­treme poverty has de­creased from 54 to 8 per­cent, thereby re­mov­ing more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple from ex­treme poverty. This is stag­ger­ing given a cur­rent re­gional pop­u­la­tion of just over 2 bil­lion peo­ple, of whom 70 per­cent are Chi­nese. At this point the good news start to wear thin since 17 per­cent of the global pop­u­la­tion still rep­re­sents just over a bil­lion peo­ple world­wide. A 50 per­cent re­duc­tion in the num­ber of chil­dren who die be­fore the age of 5, still trans­lates to 5.9 mil­lion child deaths an­nu­ally, a fright­en­ing 11 ev­ery minute. Add to this the lo­cal­ity of per­sis­tent poverty in places like sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa which, with a pop­u­la­tion of around 900 mil­lion, has shown lim­ited progress dur­ing this pe­riod given that 46 per­cent still live in ex­treme poverty, down from 57 per­cent dur­ing the early 1990s. Be­fore we di­gress to echo­ing the now de­bunked stereo­type of Africa as the dis­mal con­ti­nent, the change in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa’s ex­treme poverty has to be put in per­spec­tive. The re­duc­tion is sub­stan­tial in light of the fact that the re­gion’s pop­u­la­tion dou­bled in this pe­riod as a re­sult of an av­er­age growth rate of 2.5 per­cent per year. This re­duc­tion in poverty is par­tially the re­sult of in­creased agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity since real agri­cul­tural out­put ex­panded by more than 3 per­cent an­nu­ally since 2000. Cur­rently, more than a mil­lion small-scale Zam­bian farm­ers (most of whom farm on less than five hectares) are help­ing to shore up South Africa’s food sup­ply fol­low­ing a drought in our main white-maize pro­duc­ing ar­eas. To­tal white-maize im­ports from them is pro­jected to ex­ceed 60 000 tons this year. While this is dwarfed by our an­nual do­mes­tic har­vest of more than 6 mil­lion tons, it serves as ev­i­dence of the pro­duc­tion of an ex­portable sur­plus. It also chal­lenges South Africa’s ex­cep­tion­al­ism and serves as a pre­cur­sor of how the re­gion’s food sys­tem will de­velop. The ris­ing pros­per­ity in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa is also ev­i­denced by the fact that 43 per­cent of South Africa’s ap­ple ex­ports went to the rest of the re­gion last year, up from 13 per­cent in 2005. In fact, the rest of Africa now acts as South Africa’s main trad­ing part­ner for agri­cul­tural ex­ports. Re­turn­ing to the mega trends. For an even more com­plete view of the trends in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa the av­er­age pop­u­la­tion growth rate has to be un­packed fur­ther given the large dis­par­ity be­tween the ur­ban and ru­ral rates. The lat­ter rate is cur­rently ex­pand­ing at an av­er­age of 4.1 per­cent a year, thereby mak­ing sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa the only re­gion in the world with an ex­pand­ing ru­ral pop­u­la­tion. There is also the emer­gence of a so-called “youth bulge” where 62 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion is un­der 25 years. This phe­nom­e­non presents it­self as a dou­bleedged sword with a loom­ing em­ploy­ment cri­sis on the one side or the po­ten­tial op­por­tu­nity of a “de­mo­graphic div­i­dend” on the other. The op­por­tu­nity stems from a grow­ing labour force rel­a­tive to the num­ber of de­pen­dants, which is the ex­cep­tion rather than the norm glob­ally. In or­der to cap­i­talise on this po­ten­tial, sub­Sa­ha­ran Africa will have to echo the Chi­nese model that is driven by an in­creased out­put in man­u­fac­tur­ing. This will re­quire po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and global com­pet­i­tive­ness through in­creased spend­ing on ed­u­ca­tion and sub­stan­tial in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. To use in­fra­struc­ture as an ex­am­ple: sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa has a nor­malised paved road den­sity of 31 units ver­sus the 134 of other de­vel­op­ing re­gions, with to­tal road den­sity of 137 ver­sus 211 and main rail line den­sity of 10 ver­sus 78. The im­pact of this deficit is il­lus­trated by re­cent re­search on in­tra-African trade, show­ing that in­fras­truc­tural chal­lenges act as the ma­jor con­straint, com­pared with other re­gions where tar­iffs and trade agree­ments take the top spot. In sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, tar­iff ne­go­ti­a­tions and other trade bar­ri­ers are neg­li­gi­ble given the in­fras­truc­tural chal­lenges. There is cause for some cel­e­bra­tion on World Food Day , which was marked on Fri­day given the long term global progress in re­duc­ing the in­ci­dence of ex­treme poverty, il­lit­er­acy and dis­ease glob­ally. How­ever, in ab­so­lute and re­gional terms many chal­lenges re­main, es­pe­cially in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Given this year’s theme of “So­cial Pro­tec­tion and Agriculture: Break­ing the Cy­cle of Ru­ral Poverty” some would ar­gue for a need to help peo­ple in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa in­crease their pro­duc­tion. I would ar­gue that the em­pha­sis should fall on in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture in or­der to im­prove the in­te­gra­tion of farm­ers and man­u­fac­tur­ers with re­gional and in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. This, to­gether with im­proved ed­u­ca­tion, will en­able the re­gion’s ris­ing youth to ex­cel and ul­ti­mately to break the cy­cle of ru­ral poverty.

za,Sunday Tribune,20180617,HOW THE ‘SLEEP­ING LION’ HAS RISEN,"NAPOLEON was only half-right when he warned more than two cen­turies ago that “China is a sleep­ing lion. Let her sleep, for when she wakes she will shake the world”. China has wo­ken up and is, in­deed, shak­ing the world. But it is shak­ing the world gen­tly. Why? Chi­nese his­tory has mir­rored that of Europe. Un­til the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion, the Euro­pean elites lived well while the masses suf­fered brutish con­di­tions. The Chi­nese masses, by con­trast, suf­fered the same plight un­til as re­cently as 1978. Af­ter that year, when Deng Xiaop­ing launched the Four Moderni­sa­tions Pro­gramme, China ex­pe­ri­enced the great­est up­lift of the hu­man con­di­tion in his­tory: 800 mil­lion peo­ple were res­cued from ab­so­lute poverty. In­fant mor­tal­ity plum­meted. Vir­tu­ally ev­ery child in China goes to school to­day. How did China ac­com­plish this? It made a mas­sive U-turn. In the past, China built great walls and shut it­self in. In 1978, China’s econ­omy opened up and in­te­grated it­self with the world. An even more mo­men­tous de­ci­sion was to join the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001. The sub­se­quent ex­plo­sion of the Chi­nese econ­omy was phe­nom­e­nal. In 2000, Amer­ica’s econ­omy was 8.5 times that of China. By 2015, it was only 1.6 times larger. Within a decade, China is likely to have the world’s largest econ­omy. A resur­gent China that plays by Western­de­signed rules should, in the­ory, be wel­comed by the US. Sadly, Amer­ica is shoot­ing it­self in the foot by be­com­ing more ag­gres­sively uni­lat­eral when it should be­come more mul­ti­lat­eral. To put it bluntly, ev­ery shackle of mul­ti­lat­eral rules that the world’s cur­rent No 1 power, the US, ac­cepts for it­self is a shackle that will be passed on to the next No 1 power: China. The re­verse is also true. Ev­ery loop­hole that the US cre­ates for it­self to­day is a loop­hole that China will use to­mor­row. Even if the world will only be shaken gen­tly, some mul­ti­lat­eral rules and prac­tices will change to ac­com­mo­date China’s rise. It is writ­ten in the con­sti­tu­tion of the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund that the or­gan­i­sa­tion must be head­quar­tered in the cap­i­tal of the world’s largest econ­omy – Amer­ica will ex­pe­ri­ence its first bit of pain when the IMF shifts its HQ to Beijing. The IMF may even get its first non-euro­pean boss – since its cre­ation and that of the World Bank in 1945, there has been an un­writ­ten rule that the head of the IMF must be Euro­pean and the head of the World Bank be Amer­i­can. Such anachro­nis­tic rules and prac­tices will have to go. Tra­di­tion­ally, the global re­serve cur­rency has been that of the top eco­nomic power too. This is why the US dol­lar has reigned supreme for a cen­tury. This also con­fers on Amer­ica an “ex­or­bi­tant priv­i­lege”. Chi­nese work­ers have to toil to pro­duce goods to ex­port to Amer­ica. China gets US dol­lars in re­turn. To make good use of these dol­lars, it lends them to the Amer­i­can govern­ment by buy­ing US Trea­sury bills. And how does the Amer­i­can govern­ment re­turn these Chi­nese loans? It uses its print­ing presses to print dol­lars. Chi­nese toil is re­paid with made-up Amer­i­can money. What hap­pens when the US loses this priv­i­lege, as it in­evitably will? Amer­ica has also de­vel­oped a care­less and often thought­less in­stinct to pun­ish other coun­tries with sanc­tions. Even its al­lies have not been spared. Bri­tish banks were fined when they fi­nanced ex­ports to Iran. In­ter­na­tional law was not breached, but as these banks used US dol­lars, they ran afoul of US law. Imag­ine a world where China copies this Amer­i­can prac­tice. Clearly, it would be an un­com­fort­able place. This is why the US and Europe have to wake up now and ask them­selves a sim­ple ques­tion: Which as­pects of their in­ter­na­tional be­hav­iour would they like China to repli­cate when it be­comes the world’s top dog? And which as­pects would they like China not to repli­cate? Har­vard pro­fes­sor Gra­ham Al­li­son has noted that Amer­i­cans en­joy lec­tur­ing the Chi­nese peo­ple about need­ing to be “more like us”. He then ad­vises his fel­low Amer­i­cans to be more care­ful what they wish for. In sum, let us hope that China con­tin­ues with its cur­rent prac­tice – of only gen­tly shak­ing the world as it rises. – The New York Times",南非
za,Pretoria News,20171101,China spells out plans for new era,"CHI­NESE Am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian ad­dressed the me­dia in Pre­to­ria yes­ter­day on the out­comes of the Com­mu­nist Party of China’s (CPC) 19th Na­tional Congress, hav­ing re­turned from his coun­try’s most im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal meet­ing of the past five years, which was a his­toric mile­stone. The fun­da­men­tal out­come of the congress is that China will con­tinue striv­ing to build a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety, with the goal of erad­i­cat­ing poverty by 2020. “The congress has formed two ma­jor po­lit­i­cal judge­ments. The first is that the prin­ci­ple con­tra­dic­tion in the Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved. It is now the con­tra­dic­tion be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life,” am­bas­sador Lin said. “In the past, the prin­ci­ple con­tra­dic­tion was be­tween the ever-grow­ing ma­te­rial and cul­tural needs of the peo­ple and the back­ward­ness of so­cial pro­duc­tion. To­day, the needs to be met for the peo­ple to live a bet­ter life are in­creas­ingly broad.” Lin shared with jour­nal­ists and aca­demics that to­day there are in­creas­ing de­mands for fair­ness and jus­tice, rule of law, se­cu­rity, en­vi­ron­ment, bal­anced ur­ban and ru­ral de­vel­op­ment, and eq­ui­table in­come dis­tri­bu­tion. Cen­tral to the out­comes of the congress is that so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics has en­tered a new era where from 2020-2035 China will strive to be­come a mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try, and will im­prove the qual­ity of de­vel­op­ment. “The congress laid out a new blue­print for China’s so­cial­ist mod­erni­sa­tion drive. This congress made com­pre­hen­sive plan­ning for China’s de­vel­op­ment from now to the mid-21st cen­tury,” Lin said. This new era will es­tab­lish so­cial­ist rule of law and com­pre­hen­sively ad­vance law-based gov­er­nance. Not only did the congress high­light the new era China is mov­ing into, and out­line the new blue­print for its de­vel­op­ment, but it laid out the new thought of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the CPC. “The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics is a ma­jor the­o­ret­i­cal in­no­va­tion by the CPC in the new era,” Lin re­marked. When Xi set forth the ba­sic pol­icy on de­vel­op­ment, gov­er­nance, and the mil­i­tary, it be­came a guid­ing prin­ci­ple to unite the party and its peo­ple. Most im­por­tantly, Xi’s thought was writ­ten into the CPC’s con­sti­tu­tion, which will en­sure the longevity of his ideas. Key to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of Xi’s vi­sion will be the new gen­er­a­tion of elected lead­ers which have joined the cen­tral com­mit­tee of the CPC. The congress pri­ori­tised dis­cus­sions on how to build a strong mil­i­tary, trans­form­ing the Peo­ples’ Forces to world-class forces. The CPC seeks to en­sure its lead­er­ship over the army. Key to dis­cus­sions was also Xi’s fo­cus on “strictly gov­ern­ing the party”, and how to in­sti­tu­tion­alise the fight against cor­rup­tion while main­tain­ing a demo­cratic sys­tem. “Xi de­picted the fight against cor­rup­tion as a never-end­ing strug­gle,” Lin said. The com­mit­ment to pun­ish the “tigers and the flies” in­di­cates a com­mit­ment to deal with the cor­rup­tion of both high and low-rank­ing party of­fi­cials.

za,The Star Late Edition,20190626,China shows firm com­mit­ment to sup­port South Africa’s eco­nomic and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion and de­vel­op­ment,"H.E. AM­BAS­SADOR LIN SONG­TIAN 1. Q: Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa made his first SONA ad­dress yesterday at the new South African Par­lia­ment. Now South Africa has en­tered the New Era. Why the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment de­cided to send such a large eco­nomic and trade del­e­ga­tion to South Africa at this time? What does it mean for bi­lat­eral re­la­tions? Could you please brief us on the Chi­nese del­e­ga­tion and the ma­jor out­comes of the visit? A: It is known that both China and South Africa be­long to the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and emerg­ing mar­ket economies, are fac­ing the com­mon chal­lenge of erad­i­cat­ing poverty and the shared mis­sion of na­tional de­vel­op­ment for a bet­ter life of our peoples. The com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship be­tween China and South Africa are sup­ported by four co­op­er­a­tion plat­forms, namely the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC), BRICS co­op­er­a­tion, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) and SouthSouth Co­op­er­a­tion. Our bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have been boosted by a strong mo­men­tum of po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust, eco­nomic mu­tual ben­e­fit, peo­ple-topeo­ple friend­ship and in­ter­na­tional co­or­di­na­tion. China has be­come the most im­por­tant and re­li­able part­ner of South Africa for its eco­nomic and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion. Yesterday, in his first SONA ad­dress since be­ing elected, H.E. Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa out­lined the pri­or­i­ties of im­prov­ing in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, jobs cre­ation, a bet­ter life for peo­ple, and drew up a beau­ti­ful blue­print to lead South Africans to re­al­ize the “South African Dream” of na­tional de­vel­op­ment and re­newal. To­day, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment sends such a pow­er­ful eco­nomic and trade del­e­ga­tion of 40 ma­jor Chi­nese en­ter­prises to South Africa, for busi­ness co­op­er­a­tion with their South African coun­ter­parts. Just now, 89 Chi­nese and South African en­ter­prises signed 93 in­vest­ment and trade agree­ments worth of nearly US$ 2 bil­lion, with the pro­cure­ment of min­eral prod­ucts such as chrome, man­ganese, nickel, cobalt, cop­per, as well as agri­cul­tural prod­ucts such as fruits, nuts, lob­sters, beef, lucerne and wool, etc. The sig­nif­i­cance of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment tak­ing the lead to take such ma­jor ac­tions goes be­yond the eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion it­self. First, it fully demon­strates China’s firm po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment to sup­port the ef­forts of the new South African gov­ern­ment led by H.E. Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa for its eco­nomic and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion and de­vel­op­ment. Sec­ond, it also fully shows China’s strong con­fi­dence in South Africa re­al­iz­ing de­vel­op­ment and re­newal. Third, it sends out a pos­i­tive, clear and strong mes­sage to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­ni­ties that South Africa is on track to move for­ward the na­tional de­vel­op­ment and re­newal and will en­cour­age more coun­tries, com­pa­nies and tourists to South Africa for in­vest­ment, busi­ness and tourism. We are happy to see that the new South African Min­is­ter of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Co­op­er­a­tion Dr. Naledi Pan­dor, Min­is­ter of Trade and In­dus­try Ebrahim Patel, Min­is­ter of Agri­cul­ture, Land Re­form and Ru­ral De­vel­op­ment Thoko Didiza, Chair­man of the Port­fo­lio Com­mit­tee on In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Co­op­er­a­tion of the Na­tional Assem­bly Tandi Ma­ham­behlala, the Di­rec­tor-Gen­er­als and Deputy Di­rec­tor-Gen­er­als of the three de­part­ments and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from all sec­tors of South Africa at­tended and wit­nessed the sign­ing cer­e­mony. Though un­able to at­tend due to his di­ary, H.E. Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa con­veyed his mes­sage of con­grat­u­la­tions through Min­is­ter Patel to the sign­ing cer­e­mony. It fully shows that the South African side highly ap­pre­ci­ates China’s ac­tions and will surely more Chi­nese en­ter­prises to carry out in­vest­ment and trade co­op­er­a­tion in South Africa for the com­mon de­vel­op­ment of our two coun­tries. Th facts have shown again that the most im­por­tant ad­van­tage and out­stand­ing fea­ture of China-South Africa and China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion is that we al­ways honor our com­mit­ment and take highly ef­fi­cient and prac­ti­cal im­ple­men­ta­tion. There is no empty talks but only ac­tions in our co­op­er­a­tion. China wel­comes the US, EU and other de­vel­oped coun­tries to fol­low suite and take con­crete ac­tions, to join China to sup­port the sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment of South Africa and Africa, rather than to sab­o­tage China-South Africa and China-Africa mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion by fab­ri­cat­ing such fake news or fal­la­cies of China cre­at­ing “debt cri­sis” and “debt trap” for Africa, or “tak­ing over strate­gic as­sets”. 2. Q: It is the top pri­or­ity of the new South African gov­ern­ment led by Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa to at­tract for­eign in­vest­ment to de­velop its econ­omy, cre­ate jobs, alle­vi­ate poverty and im­prove peo­ple’s liveli­hood. How does China view South Africa’s in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment? What is the out­look of China-South Africa in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion in the near fu­ture? A: South Africa ranks the top in Africa in terms of com­pre­hen­sive na­tional strengths. It has three unique ad­van­tages of abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, unique ge­o­graphic lo­ca­tion and bet­ter con­di­tions and foun­da­tions for de­vel­op­ment. More im­por­tantly, the coun­try has a strong lead­er­ship like H.E. Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa who is pro­fi­cient in econ­omy, prag­matic in diplo­macy, and com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, at­tract­ing for­eign in­vest­ment to de­velop econ­omy, cre­ate more jobs and build­ing a de­vel­op­men­tal gov­ern­ment. We fully ap­pre­ci­ate and agree with Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa’s gov­ern­ing ideas and pol­icy guide­lines that the top pri­or­ity for the new gov­ern­ment is to en­hance ef­fi­ciency, build a safe and se­cure Africa, and im­prove the en­vi­ron­ment to at­tract more in­vest­ments to de­velop its econ­omy. We strongly be­lieve that South Africa is among the best po­ten­tial des­ti­na­tions in the world for in­vest­ment, busi­ness and tourism. Many po­ten­tial Chi­nese in­vestors share with me their strong de­sire to in­vest in South Africa, but also their three ma­jor con­cerns of per­sonal and prop­erty safety, pref­er­en­tial poli­cies and le­gal pro­tec­tion, and gov­ern­ment ef­fi­ciency. In my view, such con­cerns are widely shared by other for­eign in­vestors. Those are also the most press­ing is­sues for the South African gov­ern­ment to solve in or­der to im­prove in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment to at­tract for­eign in­vest­ment. First, the so­cial se­cu­rity is­sue must be solved to make in­vestor feel “safe”. No safety, no for­eign in­vestors, no tourists and no de­vel­op­ment. Sec­ond, com­pet­i­tive and pref­er­en­tial poli­cies, which shall be le­gal­ized into laws, are very nec­es­sary to at­tract in­vestors and make them feel “re­as­sured”. South Africa has a lot of pref­er­en­tial poli­cies for for­eign in­vest­ment. But we did not find them in laws. Third, gov­ern­ment ser­vice and ef­fi­ciency need to be im­proved to make things easy and in­vestor feel “com­fort­able”. The South African gov­ern­ment has al­ready set up some One-Stop Shops, but it seems to us it still needs a lot of work to do to stream­line the process and re­duce red tape. Another headache is­sue for for­eign in­vestors and tourists is that it is very hard to get visas to South Africa. Given the size and scope of China-South Africa co­op­er­a­tion and ex­changes of per­son­nel, and with only 3 South African visa of­fi­cials in China, we can im­age how dif­fi­cult it is to get visas to South Africa. Ac­tu­ally, this is only a tech­ni­cal is­sue that can be solved by send­ing more visa of­fi­cials to China. By do­ing so, not only more jobs will be cre­ated and more for­eign ex­changes be earned, but also tourism and na­tional de­vel­op­ment will be pro­moted. We are happy to learn that the South African De­part­ment of Home Af­fairs has de­cided to take ac­tion to solve it. Another is­sue of con­cep­tion is that it is more dif­fi­cult for for­eign in­vestors to get work­ing per­mits in South Africa. For high-tech com­pa­nies like Huawei and ma­jor in­vest­ment projects like the BAIC fac­tory in Co­gea In­dus­trial Park, it is im­por­tant to pro­vide nec­es­sary work­ing per­mits to some key tech­ni­cal and high-level man­age­ment per­son­nel to en­sure smooth op­er­a­tion of their in­vest­ment projects. Any for­eign in­vest­ment projects with 90% of lo­cal em­ploy­ment should be em­braced and wel­comed. Trust them, in­vestors will not bring the work­force far from China if they could find the ap­pro­pri­ate per­son­nel here in South Africa, be­cause it is too costly to take care of the em­ploy­ees from China 24 hours a day. Tourists will not come to South Africa if they feel dif­fi­cult to get visas. But if the key tech­ni­cal and high­level man­age­ment per­son­nel of the in­vest­ment projects can­not get visas and work­ing per­mits, it will be hard for them to make the de­ci­sion to in­vest or ex­pand their in­vest­ment in South Africa. South Africa should firstly make it clear whether or not they need to at­tract in­vestors and tourists. If you need, you make it eas­ier. Of course, visa is a sov­er­eign is­sue. We fully un­der­stand and re­spect any de­ci­sion made by the South African gov­ern­ment. With a vast con­sumer mar­ket of 1.4 bil­lion pop­u­la­tion, in­clud­ing over 400 mil­lion mid-in­come pop­u­la­tion, China im­ports over $2 tril­lion of goods, in­vests more than $100 bil­lion abroad, and makes more than 150 mil­lion over­seas trips ev­ery year. China stands ready to be­come the most im­por­tant and re­li­able part­ner of South Africa for its eco­nomic and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion, and share our de­vel­op­ment achieve­ment and huge mar­ket with South Africa for win-win co­op­er­a­tion and com­mon de­vel­op­ment. As long as South Africa could ad­dress the above con­cerns of in­vestors and tourists, China-South Africa co­op­er­a­tion in in­vest­ment, trade and tourism will em­brace a broad prospect and promis­ing fu­ture. 3. Q: The G20 Osaka Sum­mit will be held be­fore the end of June and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will meet dur­ing the Sum­mit. There is a strong ex­pec­ta­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity that China and the US could reach agree­ment at the sum­mit on the trade is­sue and stop the trade war. Is it pos­si­ble? Given the cur­rent sit­u­a­tions, will the G20 Osaka Sum­mit make new con­tri­bu­tions to global eco­nomic gov­er­nance? and will Africa ben­e­fit from it? A: Un­for­tu­nately, as the only su­per­power in the world, the US trum­peted “Amer­ica First” and launches a global trade war in or­der to main­tain its hege­mony and “make Amer­ica great again”. The global trade war has af­fected China, In­dia, Mex­ico, Ja­pan, Europe and even the whole world, and more se­ri­ously, un­der­mined the rules­based free trade sys­tem and univer­sal val­ues of fair­ness, jus­tice and rule of law. It ex­erted neg­a­tive im­pact on the global eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion. There­fore, it def­i­nitely meets strong op­po­si­tion of peo­ple all over the world. All coun­tries and peo­ple in the world sin­cerely hope that Amer­ica can aban­don the “win­ner takes all” law of jun­gle and zero-sum men­tal­ity of the Cold War, and learn to live in har­mony and en­gage in win-win co­op­er­a­tion with other coun­tries. With the ut­most sin­cer­ity, China has sent a del­e­ga­tion headed by Vice Premier Liu He to hold 11 rounds of ne­go­ti­a­tion with the US and reached a se­ries of im­por­tant con­sen­sus. How­ever, it is known to all, the cur­rent US gov­ern­ment is very good at do­ing busi­ness, and the more is of­fered, the more it wants. It forces oth­ers to sell and buy, so as to max­i­mize its own in­ter­ests. Maybe even the God does no know when the global trade war launched by the US will end. Only the US has the abil­ity to de­cide whether or not to launch the trade war and when to stop it. The ball is at the US’s court. It is un­fair for the peoples all over the world and also sab­o­tage the spirit of democ­racy, equal­ity and rule of law. Trade it­self is re­cip­ro­cal and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial. There will be no win­ner in trade war. The US does not ben­e­fit from the trade war, but in­stead iso­lates it­self from the Chi­nese mar­ket be­cause of the trade war. In the first five months this year, Chi­nese im­ports from the US de­clined by 30%. It is pre­dicted that the trade war will cost the US more than 2 mil­lion jobs and 1% of its GDP. Each Amer­i­can fam­ily will in­cur an ad­di­tional ex­pen­di­ture of US$2000 per year. In the mid and long run, the US will lose the huge mar­ket of China. On 19 June, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping held tele­phone talks with Pres­i­dent Trump at re­quest. Pres­i­dent Trump said that he looks for­ward to meet­ing Pres­i­dent Xi again dur­ing the G20 Osaka Sum­mit and have in-depth dis­cus­sions on bi­lat­eral re­la­tions and is­sues of com­mon con­cern. Pres­i­dent Xi pointed out that both China and US gain from co­op­er­a­tion and lose from con­fronta­tion. The two sides should, in ac­cor­dance with the con­sen­sus reached by the two heads of state, push for­ward the Chi­naUS re­la­tions fea­tur­ing co­or­di­na­tion, co­op­er­a­tion and sta­bil­ity on the ba­sis of mu­tual re­spect and mu­tual ben­e­fit. As the world’s two big­gest economies, China and US should jointly play a lead­ing role in push­ing for pos­i­tive out­comes at the G20 Osaka Sum­mit, so as to in­ject con­fi­dence and vi­tal­ity into the global mar­ket. Pres­i­dent Xi said he is ready to to meet with Pres­i­dent Trump dur­ing the G20 Osaka Sum­mit to ex­change views on fun­da­men­tal is­sues con­cern­ing the de­vel­op­ment of China-US re­la­tions. We sin­cerely hope that the US can hear the call of ra­tion and jus­tice from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, and re­turn to the ne­go­ti­a­tion ta­ble to end the China-US trade fric­tion as soon as pos­si­ble. G20 is an im­por­tant plat­form of global eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial gov­er­nance. There­fore, the whole world is full of ex­pec­ta­tions for the Osaka Sum­mit and hopes that lead­ers at­tend­ing the sum­mit can hear the call of the peo­ple, and make a strong voice to safe­guard mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and free trade sys­tem with the WTO at its core, up­hold fair­ness, jus­tice and the rules­based free trade or­der, firmly op­pose uni­lat­er­al­ism, trade pro­tec­tion­ism and bul­ly­ing acts, and reach new con­sen­sus and in­ject new im­pe­tus to win-win co­op­er­a­tion for com­mon pros­per­ity. Apart from Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa of South Africa, other African lead­ers such as Pres­i­dents of Egypt and Sene­gal will also at­tend the sum­mit. Africa is a promis­ing and ris­ing con­ti­nent with great po­ten­tial for de­vel­op­ment. We hope that this sum­mit could also fo­cus on Africa, lis­ten to its voice and sup­port the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the AU Agenda 2063. We also hope that de­vel­oped coun­tries can ful­fill their obli­ga­tions of help­ing Africa for its de­vel­op­ment, in­crease their in­vest­ment and fi­nan­cial sup­port to help Africa achieve self­sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. 4. Q: US Deputy Sec­re­tary of Com­merce and As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for African Af­fairs are at­tend­ing the 12th US-Africa Busi­ness Sum­mit in Mozam­bique. As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State Ti­bor Nagy is also on a visit to South Africa. This co­in­cides with the visit of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment eco­nomic and trade del­e­ga­tion. May I take it that China and the United States are con­test­ing with each other in Africa? A: Africa be­longs to African, and is also an im­por­tant part of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. To sup­port Africa re­al­ize durable peace and self­sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment serves the com­mon in­ter­ests of peo­ple all over the world and is also the com­mon re­spon­si­bil­ity of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. In the in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion with Africa, there is never lack of meet­ings or prom­ises, but con­crete ac­tions to de­liver. We wel­come the US and other de­vel­oped coun­tries to take con­crete mea­sures to re­pay the debt his­tor­i­cally owed to the African coun­tries, and ful­fill their due in­ter­na­tional obli­ga­tions. It is our sin­cere hope that the US of­fi­cials’ visit to Africa can in­ject pos­i­tive en­ergy to Africa’s ef­forts for peace and de­vel­op­ment, and put money in the bas­ket to sup­port Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion and mod­ern­iza­tion, in­stead of lec­tur­ing African lead­ers by us­ing their out­dated and in­valid text­books as proven by prac­tice. We are ready to hon­estly share with our Amer­i­can friends our views on Africa and stand ready to work to­gether with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity in­clud­ing the US, to sup­port Africa’s ef­forts to achieve last­ing peace and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. At present, African coun­tries are com­mit­ted to ac­cel­er­at­ing in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion and agri­cul­tural mod­ern­iza­tion and need huge in­vest­ments and fi­nan­cial sup­port from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, so as to break­through three bot­tle­necks of in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture, lack of pro­fes­sional and skilled per­son­nel, and short of fi­nan­cial re­sources. Ac­cord­ing to statis­tics, at present, one fifth of the in­fra­struc­ture projects in Africa are fi­nanced by China, and one third of the projects are con­structed by China. The US only fi­nanced 1.7% of those projects. As the only su­per­power in the world, the US shall pay due at­ten­tion to the peace and de­vel­op­ment in Africa. Ex­cept for mak­ing some empty prom­ises to African coun­tries from time to time, the US has dra­mat­i­cally de­creased its in­vest­ments, trade and aid to Africa since 2014. More re­gret­tably, while re­luc­tant to help Africa, the US is only con­cerned that China’s sup­port to Africa will help it to re­al­ize eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence and then po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence. This is why the US has been fab­ri­cat­ing such fake news or fal­la­cies as China cre­at­ing “debt cri­sis” or “debt trap”, “neo-colo­nial­ism” or “tak­ing over strate­gic as­sets”, so as to smear China, scare Africa and sab­o­tage China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion. Africa should be a stage for in­ter­na­tional win-win co­op­er­a­tion rather than an arena of big-power com­pe­ti­tion and ri­valry. We sin­cerely hope our Amer­i­can friends could truly pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port and take con­crete ac­tions as China does, to sup­port Africa build in­fra­struc­ture and open up their mar­ket to Africa, in­stead of mak­ing empty prom­ises to Africa, lec­tur­ing the African gov­ern­ments and peo­ple, or mak­ing fake news to un­der­mine China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion and Africa’s de­vel­op­ment.",南非
za,The Citizen (Gauteng),20191016,Oo­dles of noo­dle is­sues,"Manila – A diet heavy on cheap, mod­ern food like in­stant noo­dles that fills bel­lies but lacks key nu­tri­ents has left mil­lions of chil­dren un­healthily thin or over­weight in south­east Asia, ex­perts say. The Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Malaysia have boom­ing economies and ris­ing stan­dards of liv­ing, yet many work­ing par­ents do not have the time, money or aware­ness to steer clear of food hurt­ing their kids. In those three na­tions, an av­er­age of 40% of chil­dren aged five and be­low are mal­nour­ished, higher than the global av­er­age of one-in-three, ac­cord­ing to a re­port out yes­ter­day from Unicef, the UN chil­dren’s agency. “Par­ents be­lieve that fill­ing their chil­dren’s stom­ach is the most im­por­tant thing. They don’t re­ally think about an ad­e­quate in­take of pro­tein, cal­cium or fi­bre,” Has­bul­lah Thabrany, a pub­lic health ex­pert in In­done­sia, said. Unicef said the harm done to chil­dren was both a symp­tom of past de­pri­va­tion and a pre­dic­tor of fu­ture poverty, while iron de­fi­ciency im­paired a child’s abil­ity to learn and raised a woman’s risk of death dur­ing or shortly af­ter child­birth. To give some sense of scale to the prob­lem, In­done­sia had 24.4 mil­lion chil­dren un­der five last year, while the Philip­pines had 11 mil­lion and Malaysia 2.6 mil­lion, Unicef data showed. Mueni Mu­tunga, Unicef Asia nu­tri­tion spe­cial­ist, traced the trend back to fam­i­lies ditch­ing tra­di­tional di­ets for af­ford­able, easy-to-pre­pare “mod­ern” meals. Noo­dles are low on es­sen­tial nu­tri­ents and mi­cronu­tri­ents like iron and are also pro­tein-de­fi­cient while hav­ing high fat and salt con­tent, Mu­tunga added. In­done­sia was the world’s sec­ond-big­gest con­sumer of in­stant noo­dles, be­hind China, with 12.5 bil­lion serv­ings last year, ac­cord­ing to the World In­stant Noo­dles As­so­ci­a­tion. This is more than the to­tal con­sumed by In­dia and Ja­pan put to­gether. Nu­tri­ent-rich fruits, veg­eta­bles, eggs, dairy, fish and meat are dis­ap­pear­ing from di­ets as the ru­ral pop­u­la­tion moves to the cities in search of jobs, the Unicef re­port said. Though the Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Malaysia are all mid­dle-in­come coun­tries by World Bank mea­sures, tens of mil­lions of their peo­ple strug­gle to make enough money to live. “Poverty is the key is­sue,” said T Jaya­balan, a pub­lic health ex­pert in Malaysia, ad­ding that house­holds where both par­ents work need quickly made meals. Low-in­come house­holds in Malaysia de­pended largely on noo­dles, sweet pota­toes and soya-based prod­ucts for ma­jor meals, he said. Rolling back the in­flu­ence in­stant nod­dles have on the lives, and health, of south­east Asians will likely re­quire gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion, ex­perts said. Thabrany added: “There is mas­sive dis­tri­bu­tion. In­stant noo­dles are avail­able ev­ery­where.” –",南非
za,Cape Times,20151222,Steel work­ers’ jobs saved,"THE Depart­ment of Labour said a gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion had helped se­cure con­tin­ued em­ploy­ment for 650 work­ers at Evraz Highveld Steel, who had been fac­ing pos­si­ble re­trench­ment. The depart­ment said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it had worked to­gether with the Depart­ment of Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment to give Evraz Highveld Steel ac­cess to the Depart­ment of Labour’s Train­ing Lay­off Scheme, part of gov­ern­ment’s broader re­sponse to prob­lems ex­pe­ri­enced in the steel sec­tor.

za,Pretoria News,20190103,What lies ahead for Africa?,"WHAT kind of a year should Africans ex­pect? What do trends from 2018 tell us about what we can log­i­cally and rea­son­ably ex­pect of 2019? It is pos­si­ble to look closely at last year’s trends in or­der to an­tic­i­pate the state of the con­ti­nent this year. This is partly be­cause trends in African pol­i­tics and eco­nomics do not start and end with years but tend to spill over from year to year. It is be­cause real trends in Africa are of a long-term na­ture. If the DRC con­tin­ues with its elec­toral and post-elec­toral vi­o­lence, then South­ern and Cen­tral Africa are likely to feel the im­pact es­pe­cially if this vi­o­lence is pro­tracted. Sim­i­larly, a peace­ful post-elec­toral en­vi­ron­ment marked by na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and so­cial co­he­sion will likely au­gur well for the en­tire re­gion. The fact that Zim­babwe averted a full cri­sis af­ter a coup in 2017 helped pre­vent a melt­down in South­ern Africa. The one good rea­son why we must ap­ply our minds to trends for this year is that it is bet­ter to an­tic­i­pate than to re­spond to de­vel­op­ments af­ter the fact. This ap­plies equally to lead­ers of econ­omy, pol­i­tics and so­ci­ety as it does to thinkers, com­men­ta­tors and ac­tivists. It is good to heed an an­cient African proverb that main­tains: “Even if it drowned your child, you will still need wa­ter.” That need for us to an­tic­i­pate means that even if things don’t al­ways work in our favour, hope should still re­side in us at all times. The first ma­jor cur­rent trend we are tak­ing into 2019 is go­ing to be the dis-junc­ture be­tween pos­i­tive growth rates and low lev­els of de­vel­op­ment. Many economies are among high growth cases but poverty re­mains rooted in our so­ci­eties. Growth without jobs trans­lates to an im­pov­er­ished qual­ity of life. An­other chal­lenge is the over-re­liance on the good­ness of big and pop­u­lar lead­ers at the ex­pense of in­sti­tu­tions. The for­tunes of many coun­tries still hang on lead­ers who hold things to­gether as in Rwanda and Gabon or who let things fall apart as in Cameroon and Bu­rundi. While there is a de­cline in the in­ci­dence of wars there is also a rise of in­ternecine vi­o­lence that comes in dif­fer­ent forms such as com­mu­nal, pas­toral, elec­tion-re­lated and gen­der-based vi­o­lence. Th­ese are trends we need to care­fully watch es­pe­cially in the Sa­hel and other semi-arid ar­eas. Lack of so­cial part­ner­ships that bind to­gether the state, civil so­ci­ety and busi­ness re­main a com­mon prob­lem. This robs coun­tries like Chad, Mada­gas­car and Su­dan of so­cial co­he­sion ne­c­es­sary to plot a way out of low growth, high de­s­pair and an ex­ter­nal de­pen­dency trap. Re­source de­pen­dency like over-re­liance on one or two eco­nomic sec­tors deep­ens the age-old prob­lem of a nar­row base of eco­nomic pro­duc­tion. Un­der th­ese con­di­tions, economies are un­able to of­fer path­ways out of poverty and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Coun­tries like the DRC and Congo Braz­zav­ille over-rely on abun­dant re­sources, whose ex­ploita­tion is not gov­erned well and as a re­sult, the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple re­main mired in poverty. If we don’t fix the chal­lenges that be­set us, re­gional in­te­gra­tion and con­ti­nen­tal in­te­gra­tion will re­main rhetoric and mere sum­mit as it is un­likely that states will this time de­cide to cede some sovereignty to re­gional in­sti­tu­tions in or­der to en­able them to make and pur­sue a firm de­ci­sion on in­te­gra­tion. The laud­able “Africa We Want Plan” geared to­wards Agenda 2063 will re­main a com­mit­ment in prin­ci­ple and not in prac­tice. Un­der the cur­rent con­di­tions, the young will con­tinue to move from out­ly­ing ar­eas to the al­ready con­gested cities to eke out a liv­ing. With this comes grow­ing des­ti­tu­tion, dis­con­tent and dis­il­lu­sion­ment. In th­ese cur­rent con­di­tions, ter­ror­ism and crim­i­nal­ity thrive. Young peo­ple will con­tinue to un­der­take those per­ilous trips across the Sa­hara Desert and across the Mediter­ranean Sea in search of ba­sic liv­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the more pros­per­ous con­ti­nent of Europe. The trends we have seen thus far such as the change of lead­er­ship style with the emer­gence of the likes of Joao Manuel Lourenzo in An­gola, Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Ge­orge Weah of Liberia and Emer­son Mnan­gagwa of Zim­babwe per­haps sig­nals a new crop of lead­ers who may po­ten­tially bring about the wave of change African coun­tries so des­per­ately need. The ex­ter­nal fac­tor is also key to Africa’s plight. The sup­port from China is per­haps the big­gest game changer from out­side fol­lowed by grow­ing in­vest­ment from other emerg­ing economies that range from Qatar to Turkey to In­dia and Brazil. But the ri­valry be­tween the US and China and Rus­sia will af­fect Africa in var­i­ous ways in 2019. This is be­cause Africa’s strate­gic in­ter­ests will be made sec­ondary to those of th­ese big pow­ers fight­ing their own bat­tles on African soil. But we need a birth of new cit­i­zens, new cit­i­zens move­ments and new ac­tivism that will back up those lead­ers who are bold enough to en­sure a bet­ter life for all and new cit­i­zens who will play a watch­dog role over all those who are in au­thor­ity. The Africa of 2019 is not the only one filled with chal­lenges and prospects of change and con­ti­nu­ity but also prospects of pit­falls. This year will de­pend on what cit­i­zens and lead­ers are pre­pared to do to har­ness the spirit of unity and so­cial co­he­sion in or­der to move Africa closer to the idea of a bet­ter life for all.

The ma­jor is­sue con­fronting our new ANC demo­cratic govern­ment was the ab­ject poverty, the ab­sence of ba­sic ser­vices and the lack of education and train­ing of more than three-quar­ters of our pop­u­la­tion. Many of those in ex­ile had stud­ied the Chi­nese and Rus­sian eco­nomic mod­els, and ac­quired education at their univer­si­ties. Yet, when the ANC came to power, they did not use the de­vel­op­men­tal knowl­edge they had ac­quired. In China, within five years of the rev­o­lu­tion, for ex­am­ple, ev­ery Chi­nese per­son was guar­an­teed one hot meal a day. In South Africa, ev­ery­thing should have been con­cen­trated on the coun­try’s eco­nomic and ed­u­ca­tional needs. We didn’t just need the prom­ise of free education, we needed an eco­nomic plan as to how this could work. Then we needed the coun­try’s econ­o­mists to be brought to­gether in or­der to thrash out work­able pro­grammes to sus­tain the econ­omy in or­der to pro­vide what was re­quired to carry for­ward the rev­o­lu­tion, which was al­ready the envy of the world. If we are to con­tinue with our so­cial­ist sys­tem of pro­vid­ing many free ser­vices to the poor, a flour­ish­ing econ­omy also needs to be in place, through big busi­ness and in­dus­try, to pro­vide fis­cal re­sources. Be­cause of our skewed elec­toral sys­tem, the ANC will surely re­main in power for the next few years. But two mas­sive prob­lems face them. First, all the prob­lem-solv­ing they cur­rently do is very much on an un­planned, ad hoc ba­sis. For ex­am­ple, the education cri­sis arises, so­lu­tion? Let’s find a few bil­lion rand to plas­ter over the prob­lem. No plan, for a sit­u­a­tion any­one could have pre­dicted 20 years ago. The se­cond ma­jor fault is that they do not take ad­vice, not even from the top ex­perts in the coun­try. They want to be seen to be ini­ti­at­ing ev­ery­thing, in or­der to feed their in­sa­tiable ap­petite for the ag­gran­dis­e­ment of their or­gan­i­sa­tion, which func­tions much like a feu­dal lord. The ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem is tes­ta­ment to their ex­per­i­ments with the lives of South Africans. So, if we pro­pose to learn from the Chi­nese eco­nomic model, let’s have a rig­or­ous five-year re­cov­ery plan. Set up think tanks of top econ­o­mists, bankers, busi­ness­men, in­dus­tri­al­ists, med­i­cal spe­cial­ists and academics, and ed­u­ca­tion­ists to make pro­pos­als for a work­able sys­tem.

za,The Star Late Edition,20090713,Na­tion­al­i­sa­tion de­stroyed many economies. It’s a fact,"THE IM­PRES­SION cre­ated by Stan­dard Bank’s econ­o­mist Goolam Bal­lim in The Star of July 8, that China has had some suc­cess through state own­er­ship of pro­duc­tion, is mis­lead­ing, It raises a con­cern as to his knowl­edge in such mat­ters and the ef­fect his ad­vice may have on Stan­dard Bank funds re­liant on that ad­vice. Bal­lim would do well to un­der­stand the dy­nam­ics of the “lim­ited suc­cess” of state own­er­ship in China, and in­deed the ram­i­fi­ca­tions of na­tion­al­i­sa­tion. If he stud­ied the mat­ter he would find re­stric­tive labour prac­tices, unions dom­i­nated by the state, and nowhere near the free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion and de­mand mech­a­nism that we have here. Nei­ther our whites nor blacks are Chi­nese and will­ing to work for very low wages, no strikes and no “de­mand” cul­ture. The Chi­nese labour unions are beginning to be­come more ac­tive, but they still face con­trol from the state. This lim­ited free­dom, how­ever, moves hand in hand with more pri­vati­sa­tion of pre­vi­ously state-dom­i­nated com­pa­nies. Na­tion­al­i­sa­tion and sub­se­quent own­er­ship by a state of min­ing com­pa­nies, fail. There are no long-term suc­cesses. For two sim­ple rea­sons. Risky ven­tures (such as the cycli­cal com­mod­ity busi­ness) are fi­nanced by dif­fer­ent in­vestors at dif­fer­ent times; they bring cap­i­tal, with­draw cap­i­tal, make some re­turns (cap­i­tal or profit) or make some losses. Cap­i­tal moves. Fur­ther, at times cap­i­tal has to be ruth­less in terms of shed­ding or em­ploy­ing peo­ple. The state can do nei­ther of th­ese things. The state’s cap­i­tal, once in­vested, stays. Re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion to take ad­van­tage of op­por­tu­ni­ties or to main­tain as­sets sel­dom hap­pens timeously, sim­ply be­cause there are so many com­pet­ing pri­or­i­ties for state funds. Nei­ther can the state hire or fire peo­ple at will. (How many state em­ploy­ees, for in­stance, have lost their job dur­ing the cur­rent fi­nan­cial cri­sis?) The so­cial con­tract, which is pol­i­tics, does not al­low job dis­missals. The gov­ern­ment that fires hun­dreds of peo­ple would have a tough time come elec­tions. The point which has to be made is that na­tion­al­i­sa­tion de­stroys. Few com­men­ta­tors ever talk about the ef­fect of that de­struc­tion, and that is where the dan­ger lies. Peo­ple talk about scar­ing of for­eign in­vestors, but what does the man in the street care about the for­eign in­vestor? So what if they can’t come here and make money? This point is self-ev­i­dent in the eco­nomic his­tory of all of Africa since in­de­pen­dence in coun­tries that tried na­tion­al­i­sa­tion. All failed, with ter­ri­ble con­se­quences which in­cluded mass poverty, star­va­tion, civil wars and the de­struc­tion of eco­nomic sys­tems lead­ing to an African econ­omy which to­day is a frac­tion of what it was at the time of in­di­vid­ual coun­tries’ in­de­pen­dence. Why th­ese con­se­quences? Sim­ple. As a re­sult of na­tion­al­i­sa­tion or the threat thereof in­vestors will no longer pro­vide cap­i­tal in­flows. The state then has to pro­vide all the cap­i­tal and there sim­ply is not enough of that, since the state also has a duty to spend money on so­cial struc­tures. It means that as­sets will be con­sumed rather than grown, earn­ing ever less for­eign ex­change. No, or much less, for­eign ex­change means no more Ben­zes, or spares for them, no more flat-screen TVs ex­cept for those op­er­a­tors who do their busi­ness ruth­lessly and much of it out­side the law. They will have the dol­lars. To buy the dol­lars will be ex­pen­sive. The cur­rency will ad­just and lose value. Those want­ing dol­lars will de­stroy fur­ther as­sets to get them. The state ul­ti­mately sees that it’s trea­sury weak­ens, and to ac­cess ever-de­creas­ing re­turns it re­sorts to de­stroy­ing and mon­etis­ing that which is left for the ben­e­fit of those in the in­ner cir­cle. Na­tion­al­i­sa­tion is the road to ex­treme poverty for all. A fact. D Reck­son Bryanston, Sand­ton",南非
za,Cape Times,20151204,Focac sum­mit will help forge a closer com­mu­nity,"TWO days ago, at the in­vi­ta­tion of Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping once again ar­rived in this beau­ti­ful rain­bow na­tion for a state visit to South Africa. To­day, Xi will co-chair the Sand­ton sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) with Zuma. This is Pres­i­dent Xi’s sec­ond state visit to South Africa in three years. The two pres­i­dents had a fruit­ful meet­ing and wit­nessed the sign­ing of a se­ries of agree­ments. The visit is a great suc­cess, mark­ing an­other mile­stone in the history of China-South Africa re­la­tions. The two sides have fur­ther con­sol­i­dated po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust and tra­di­tional friend­ship, and reached new im­por­tant con­sen­sus on co-op­er­a­tion in key ar­eas, which will fur­ther pro­mote the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the five-to-10-year strate­gic pro­gramme for co-op­er­a­tion and the de­vel­op­ment of the com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship. To­day, the Focac sum­mit opens at the Sand­ton Con­ven­tion Cen­tre. This is a his­toric event as it is the sec­ond sum­mit of the fo­rum fol­low­ing the 2006 Beijing sum­mit, and the first sum­mit to be held on African soil. The sum­mit has cho­sen the theme “Africa-China Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co-op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment”. Lead­ers and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from 50 African mem­ber states of Focac as well as lead­ers of the African Union and other ma­jor in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions will at­tend. Xi will com­pre­hen­sively elab­o­rate on China’s new vi­sions, poli­cies and mea­sures to fur­ther strengthen Chi­naAfrica sol­i­dar­ity and co-op­er­a­tion. The sum­mit will also adopt the Johannesburg Dec­la­ra­tion and the Ac­tion Plan (2016-2018). In a word, this sum­mit is des­tined to be­come a his­toric, grand event. The sum­mit will fur­ther syn­er­gise China and Africa’s re­spec­tive de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. Cur­rently, both China and Africa are at the cru­cial stage of de­vel­op­ment and have formulated am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. China has put for­ward two cen­te­nary goals and the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee has pro­posed the 13th five-year pro­gramme. The AU has adopted agenda 2063 and its first 10-year im­ple­men­ta­tion plan. China and Africa are mov­ing for­ward in the same di­rec­tion. Dur­ing the up­com­ing sum­mit, lead­ers will dis­cuss ways to fur­ther align China and Africa’s de­vel­op­ment strate­gies and map out the new blueprint for co-op­er­a­tion. The sum­mit will pro­mote China-Africa prac­ti­cal co-op­er­a­tion. Dur­ing the sum­mit, China will an­nounce new mea­sures of co-op­er­a­tion with Africa for the next three years, which is both a tra­di­tion and a defin­ing fea­ture of Focac. Th­ese new mea­sures will di­rectly serve the de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of both sides. Pri­or­ity will be given to ad­dress two ma­jor bot­tle­necks con­strain­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely the back­ward in­fra­struc­ture and lack of pro­fes­sion­als. More­over, China will fo­cus on is­sues con­cern­ing African peo­ple’s well-be­ing, like food, em­ploy­ment and health, and strengthen co-op­er­a­tion in such ma­jor ar­eas as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture build­ing, pub­lic health and poverty re­duc­tion, in­vest­ment and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, peo­ple-topeo­ple ex­changes, peace and se­cu­rity, and green de­vel­op­ment. I be­lieve there will be many ex­cit­ing high­lights. The sum­mit will greatly pro­mote south­south co-op­er­a­tion. Africa is home to the largest num­ber of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and China is the largest de­vel­op­ing coun­try in the world. China-Africa co-op­er­a­tion fol­lows the trend of world de­vel­op­ment and the col­lec­tive rise of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and will make a pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tion to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Well be­gun is half done. I am fully con­fi­dent that, just like Pres­i­dent Xi’s state visit, the Focac sum­mit will also be a great suc­cess. I be­lieve China and Africa will forge an even closer com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture, shared in­ter­ests and de­vel­op­ment.

za,Cape Argus,20091224,"Oil pumps out, China pumps in cash … and An­golans re­main in poverty","LUANDA: From mag­a­zine cov­ers to bill­boards, mes­sages of “Viva An­gola” and “Proud to be An­golan” in Luanda mark the war-scarred na­tion’s ris­ing in­ter­na­tional pres­ence. Within three weeks, An­gola will stage the foot­ball African Cup of Na­tions (CAN) on the back of host­ing Tues­day’s pow­er­ful Opec oil car­tel and se­cur­ing its first In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) loan seven years af­ter the end of a 27-year civil war. “An­gola sees it­self as a re­gional su­per­power,” said Alex Vines of Lon­don-based think-tank Chatham House. “The ex­pand­ing num­ber of em­bassies open­ing in Luanda at­test to its grow­ing in­flu­ence.” Africa’s top oil sup­plier has boomed since the 2002 cease­fire, with dou­ble digit growth be­tween 2004 and 2008. Growth for 2010 is fore­cast at over 8 per­cent af­ter the re­ces­sion and emer­gency oil quo­tas slashed the years of up­swing in 2009, with 95 per­cent of ex­port in­come de­rived from the vast crude re­serves. Luanda’s crane-dom­i­nated sky­line is tes­ti­mony to a construction frenzy, with in­fra- struc­ture spending on next month’s four-city CAN tour­na­ment es­ti­mated at $1 bil­lion (about R7.7bn). Chi­nese firms have sev­eral key con­tracts. Chi­nese credit lines to An­gola are be­lieved to ex­ceed $5bn. Fear of China’s en­try into Africa played di­rectly into An­gola’s hands af­ter years of half­hearted re­cep­tion from re­form­push­ing in­ter­na­tional lenders, said Nom­fundo Ng­wenya of the South African In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs. “China’s step­ping into the scene was un­doubt­edly a game- changer. An­gola sud­denly found a seem­ingly in­fi­nite source of fi­nance, without the strin­gency of ex­ter­nally im­posed po­lit­i­cal, so­cial and eco­nomic re­form,” she said. “Sud­denly ev­ery­body is act­ing as a suitor and the An­golans are beat­ing their ch­ests about their abil­ity to en­gage a wide range of play­ers without be­ing dic­tated to, some­thing that not many African coun­tries can boast.” Seen as a sign of cred­i­bil­ity, An­gola’s se­cur­ing of its first post-war IMF loan of $1.4bn last month came with com­men- da­tions from the global lender for com­mit­ment to re­forms. But de­spite the cur­rent bask in the spot­light, two-thirds of An­golans live on less than $2 a day and Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional last month scored An­gola as the 18th most cor­rupt state on its an­nual cor­rup­tion in­dex. Ng­wenya voiced un­cer­tainty as to whether An­gola’s im­age had changed de­spite the cur­rent spot­light and high-pro­file vis­its this year by US Sec­re­tary of State Hil­lary Clin­ton and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Dmitry Medvedev. “An­gola is still syn­ony­mous with cor­rup­tion and poverty and it is not yet clear how the wind­fall is be­ing used,” she said. “The truth is that the coun­try has been so in­ward-looking for so long that they have yet to craft a strat­egy for sell­ing them­selves to the rest of the world.” An­gola was be­ing forced to re­flect on what it wanted from re­gional and broader for­eign pol­icy, she added. For Vines, the key for An­gola is to de­velop its hu­man cap­i­tal. “An­gola’s hu­man de­vel­op­ment in­dices still re­main stub­bornly low,” he said. At a fill­ing sta­tion this week, 23-year-old Evan­dro Mon­duro said few had reaped the ben­e­fits of liv­ing in Africa’s top crude pro­ducer. “I don’t see any­thing,” he said. “If you see here, maybe 20 peo­ple see the ben­e­fits. Only 20,” he said, point­ing to a 500me­tre queue for petrol stretch­ing be­hind him, as the exclusive Opec oil club gath­ered un­der Luanda’s pres­i­dency. – Sapa-AFP",南非
za,Daily Dispatch,20201230,From child mar­riages to re­venge porn. 10 set­backs for women,"CAR­ING DU­TIES/ UN­PAID LABOUR Even be­fore Covid-19, women were do­ing three times as much un­paid care and do­mes­tic work as men, ac­cord­ing to UN data, but this has soared in 2020 with women un­der­tak­ing the lion’s share of car­ing for sick fam­ily mem­bers and chil­dren off school. One sur­vey of par­ents in five wealthy coun­tries showed moth­ers’ un­paid work at home had nearly dou­bled to 65 hours a week — al­most a third more than for fa­thers. A woman’s equal­ity group in Bri­tain said there were “hints of a re­turn to the 1950s” in terms of the divi­sion of labour. In Tur­key, re­search found women did four times as much house­hold and care work as men dur­ing lock­downs. JOB LOSSES Covid-19 has dis­pro­por­tion­ately hit sec­tors em­ploy­ing high num­bers of women in­clud­ing hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail and tourism. Some women have also cut back paid work to take on ex­tra car­ing du­ties. One re­port found moth­ers in Eng­land were 47% more likely than fa­thers to have lost or left jobs. In de­vel­op­ing coun­tries most women work in the in­for­mal econ­omy with few pro­tec­tions against lay­offs. In Kenya, 20% of women have lost jobs or in­come com­pared to 12% of men, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment. The pan­demic has had a par­tic­u­larly dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on mi­grant work­ers. In Le­banon, some for­eign maids have been thrown on the street by em­ploy­ers un­able to pay them. DO­MES­TIC VI­O­LENCE Long swept un­der the car­pet, do­mes­tic vi­o­lence made head­lines in 2020 as lock­downs left women trapped at home with abu­sive part­ners. The United Na­tions warned the cri­sis could lead to a 20% rise in do­mes­tic abuse, de­scrib­ing it as a “shadow pan­demic”. Hor­ri­fied by the surge in vi­o­lence, UN Sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res called for a cease­fire at home”. Helplines in some places saw a five-fold rise in calls but lock­downs made it harder for ser­vices to reach vic­tims. Some coun­tries con­verted ho­tels and hol­i­day-lets into refuge spa­ces and set up ini­tia­tives to en­cour­age vic­tims to seek help dur­ing trips to the su­per­mar­ket or phar­macy. There were re­ports of in­creased femi­cides dur­ing lock­downs. GIRLS EDUCATION ’ Covid-19 forced school clo­sures in most coun­tries, im­pact­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of girls. In Africa, child rights groups fear many girls could drop out of school per­ma­nently, jeop­ar­dis­ing decades of work to re­verse deep-rooted gen­der in­equal­i­ties. School clo­sures have put girls at in­creased risk of sex­ual vi­o­lence and child mar­riage, while lock­down poverty has forced some into “trans­ac­tional sex to buy ba­sics. Sev­eral coun­tries are al­ready re­port­ing spikes in teen preg­nan­cies and early mar­riages, rais­ing con­cerns that many girls may never re­turn to class. CHILD MAR­RIAGE The United Na­tions has pre­dicted the pan­demic could lead to an ex­tra 13 mil­lion child mar­riages over the next decade, po­ten­tially un­do­ing decades of work to end the prac­tice, as deep­en­ing poverty pushes fam­i­lies to marry off daugh­ters early. School clo­sures have ex­ac­er­bated the risks. Author­i­ties in Ethiopia have res­cued hun­dreds of girls since schools shut. In Malawi, one char­ity re­ported a 350% rise in calls linked to child and forced mar­riages in the spring. FE­MALE GEN­I­TAL MU­TI­LA­TION The United Na­tions has pre­dicted 2 mil­lion more girls than pre­vi­ously pre­dicted could un­dergo FGM in the next decade as Covid-19 dis­rupts ef­forts to end the prac­tice. In­creased rates of cut­ting have been re­ported across East and West Africa with lock­downs seen as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out FGM un­de­tected. Hard­ship has fu­elled the rise in some cases be­cause par­ents think they can get better “bride prices if daugh­ters are cut, cam­paign­ers say. In So­ma­lia, cir­cum­cis­ers have gone door-to-door of­fer­ing to cut girls stuck at home. Cam­paign­ers in Kenya, which has vowed to end FGM by 2022, have re­ported mass cut­tings in the Kuria com­mu­nity, with girls pa­raded through town cen­tres and show­ered with gifts. In Egypt, global me­dia re­ported that a man was ar­rested for al­legedly get­ting a doc­tor to cut his three daugh­ters after con­ning them into think­ing they were having COVID vac­ci­na­tions. ABOR­TION Poland im­posed a near-to­tal ban on ter­mi­na­tions in Oc­to­ber, lead­ing to mas­sive street protests. In the US, abor­tion rights groups fear the ap­point­ment of re­li­gious con­ser­va­tive Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court could jeop­ar­dise a land­mark 1973 rul­ing which le­galised abor­tion na­tion­wide. In Malawi, pow­er­ful re­li­gious groups are strongly re­sist­ing a bill to ease re­stric­tions on abor­tion. Glob­ally, coro­n­avirus has in­creased bar­ri­ers to abor­tion for many women due to travel re­stric­tions, clinic clo­sures and over­loaded health ser­vices. MA­TER­NAL HEALTH The num­ber of women dy­ing in preg­nancy and child­birth has fallen by more than a third since 2000, but health ex­perts say the pan­demic could erode gains as women lose ac­cess to con­tra­cep­tion and re­pro­duc­tive health care. The Guttmacher In­sti­tute, a Us-based re­pro­duc­tive health re­search or­gan­i­sa­tion, es­ti­mated even mod­est dis­rup­tions to health ser­vices would lead to 15 mil­lion un­in­tended preg­nan­cies, 28,000 ma­ter­nal deaths, and 3.3 mil­lion un­safe abor­tions. Coro­n­avirus shut clin­ics and out­reach pro­grammes in many places this year as staff were re­de­ployed to fight the virus. Fac­tory clo­sures and ship­ping de­lays also caused short­ages of con­tra­cep­tives and abor­tion pills. Across Latin Amer­ica, U.N ex­perts es­ti­mate 18 mil­lion women and teenagers could stop us­ing con­tra­cep­tion, po­ten­tially lead­ing to more than 600,000 un­wanted preg­nan­cies. TRAF­FICK­ING In­creas­ing poverty and school clo­sures have left many girls and women more vul­ner­a­ble to traf­fick­ing in­clud­ing on­line sex­ual ex­ploita­tion, ac­cord­ing to UN ex­perts. They say the eco­nomic down­turn and job losses will likely in­crease traf­fick­ing from coun­tries with the fastest and most pro­longed falls in em­ploy­ment — a pat­tern seen dur­ing the global 2007-2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Char­i­ties say the traf­fick­ing of Cam­bo­dian “brides” to China has al­ready risen sharply. Glob­ally, there has also been a surge in cy­ber­sex traf­fick­ing in which women and chil­dren are forced into sex­ual acts livestreamed for pay­ing clients world­wide. The Philip­pines — con­sid­ered the epi­cen­tre of cy­ber­sex traf­fick­ing — re­ported that cases of on­line child sex abuse had tripled un­der coro­n­avirus. RE­VENGE PORN Women have re­ported a rise in “re­venge porn” — on­line posts of in­ti­mate images, usu­ally by abu­sive part­ners or ex­part­ners — dur­ing lock­downs. One helpline in Bri­tain said its cases had dou­bled in April. In France, an ac­tivist started a cam­paign called #stop­fisha to help vic­tims re­port abuse after notic­ing an in­crease in pho­tos and videos of naked girls on social me­dia, tagged with their names. In Morocco a social me­dia cam­paign has em­bold­ened hun­dreds of “re­venge porn” vic­tims to fight back against a phe­nom­e­non that has driven some to con­sider sui­cide. While many vic­tims are tar­geted by venge­ful for­mer part­ners, oth­ers are sin­gled out by strangers who hack their social me­dia ac­counts to steal pho­tos and in­for­ma­tion.

Both the South African gov­ern­ment and the Nel­son Man­dela Cen­tre of Mem­ory con­grat­u­lated Obama on his re-elec­tion. “We value our re­la­tions with the United States and look for­ward to strength­en­ing bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion in the years to come,” said Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma in a mes­sage on be­half of the South African gov­ern­ment. He said the US had an im­por­tant role to play in Africa’s de­vel­op­ment. In win­ning the elec­tion, Obama be­came the sec­ond Demo­crat to win a sec­ond four-year term in the White House since World War 2. The Nel­son Man­dela Cen­tre of Mem­ory also recorded its con­grat­u­la­tions. “On be­half of our founder [for­mer pres­i­dent] Nel­son Man­dela and our board of trus­tees, we con­grat­u­late you upon your re­elec­tion,” spokesman Sello Hatang said. He said the US was a vi­tal part­ner in Africa’s ef­forts to over­come poverty and in­equal­ity. World­wide, the word “phew” trended on Twit­ter in re­sponse to Obama’s re-elec­tion. Even Tom McGrath, pres­i­dent of Republicans Abroad France, con­ceded: “It’s clear if they could vote, Europe would vote 80% for Obama.” Praise for Obama was not univer­sal. Pak­istani Tal­iban spokesman Ah­san­ul­lah Ah­san said Mus­lims should not ex­press hap­pi­ness about Obama’s vic­tory.

The 2nd Min­is­te­rial Fo­rum on China-Africa Health De­vel­op­ment held in Cape Town yesterday reaf­firmed the co-op­er­a­tion agree­ment orig­i­nally reached dur­ing a sum­mit in Bei­jing in 2013. Health Min­is­ter Aaron Mot­soaledi yesterday called on the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to share its ex­per­tise in tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion with Africa to help build durable health sys­tems in the con­ti­nent and com­bat poverty, dur­ing his speech as host of the gath­er­ing. Mot­soaledi said the part­ner­ship be­tween the two coun­tries should recog­nise the im­por­tance of knowl­edge shar­ing as a means to em­power each other. Both sides adopted a frame­work chart­ing the fu­ture course of co-op­er­a­tion over the next three years un­der the theme of “Pro­mot­ing the ac­cess of Healthcare ser­vice in Africa, Im­prov­ing China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion in Public Health in post-Ebola era”. It fo­cused on public health, hu­man re­sources de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion, the cre­ation of in­fra­struc­ture, lab­o­ra­tory ser­vices, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and in­for­ma­tion shar­ing, ac­cess to med­i­cal ser­vices, short med- ical mis­sions, co-op­er­a­tion be­tween med­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions, co­op­er­a­tion in tra­di­tional medicine and im­prov­ing Africa’s ac­cess to med­i­cal prod­ucts. The Chi­nese would con­tinue to send China Med­i­cal Teams to work in African coun­tries, and re­cruit med­i­cal staff. They would also take new mea­sures to or­gan­ise short­term med­i­cal teams com­posed of clin­i­cal spe­cial­ists to 40 African coun­tries and work with their African coun­ter­parts to pro­vide spe­cific med­i­cal ser­vices with train­ing, such as free cataract surgery to the lo­cal peo­ple on mu­tual agree­ment. Train­ing The Chi­nese also agreed to con­tinue to pro­vide schol­ar­ships and train­ing cour­ses to public health pro­fes­sion­als in Africa, both in China and in African coun­tries. African coun­tries agreed to sup­port the re­cruit­ment process and en­sure that qual­i­fied can­di­dates are iden­ti­fied and re­tained. African coun­tries welcome China’s of­fer to send public health pro­fes­sion­als to work with their African coun­ter­parts, and will pro­vide the nec­es­sary cour­te­sies and sup­port for them to work in Africa. The Min­is­te­rial Fo­rum on China-Africa Health De­vel­op­ment, brought to­gether more than 30 African health min­is­ters, Chi­nese of­fi­cials and heads of in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and World Bank to dis­cuss the fu­ture of China-Africa health co-op­er­a­tion.

In terms of the dec­la­ra­tion, all sig­na­to­ries con­sid­ered that health should be an in­trin­sic part of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The China-Africa health col­lab­o­ra­tion should be guided by African coun­tries’ ac­tion pro­grammes and strate­gies, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ac­tion pro­grammes, the AU’s Agenda 2063 and the UN Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. The sig­na­to­ries em­pha­sised the need to take ac­tion against non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases, pre­ventable com­mu­ni­ca­ble and emerg­ing dis­eases, such as Ebola Virus Dis­ease (EVD), HIV/Aids, TB and malaria.

For Africa, which is try­ing to move away from a donorde­pen­dency syn­drome and to de­velop its own man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, China is a nat­u­ral part­ner. in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions lec­turer at the US In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity in Nairobi, Kenya. “The prospects are bright. The two sides would need to de­velop a com­mon vi­sion as to in­dus­tries and other as­pects of hu­man de­vel­op­ment,” he said. Chung, also the au­thor of Zim­babwe Look­ing East, said a skewed model of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Africa and the West was partly to blame for the un­der­de­vel­op­ment and wide­spread poverty in Africa as it fo­cused mainly on the pro­duc­tion of pri­mary goods for the West. How­ever, China, as a tra­di­tional friend of Africa, will not fol­low Western coun­tries’ track and will not sac­ri­fice Africa’s en­vi­ron­ment and long-term in­ter­ests. Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi has said that China will help Africa with in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, food se­cu­rity, pub­lic health and dis­ease preven­tion. China will help Africa achieve self-de­vel­op­ment and cre­ate a peace­ful and stable en­vi­ron­ment for long-term progress. China does not at­tach po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions to as­sis­tance, nor does it con­strain or in­ter­fere in the do­mes­tic af­fairs of African coun­tries, Wang said.

The boom­ing in­fra­struc­ture pro­grammes ex­em­plify the win-win co-op­er­a­tion. “With im­proved in­fra­struc­ture and com­mu­ni­ca­tions sys­tems in Africa, both China and African coun­tries re­duce their unit cost of op­er­a­tion, which it­self is a wealth cre­ation,” Macharia said. “This helps to ac­cel­er­ate eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion, as the sav­ings in terms of time and fi­nance are ploughed back into the re­spec­tive economies,” he pointed out. Though China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion is hailed by the two sides, there are chal­lenges. Ikiara said those chal­lenges in­clude low ex­ist­ing ca­pac­ity among African coun­tries, so­cioe­co­nomic un­cer­tainty and po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity. More­over, “global pro­pa­ganda” against China and its re­la­tion­ship with Africa is a chal­lenge which needs to be closely mon­i­tored be­fore it causes dis­rup­tions, he said.

Emerg­ing economies pointed to the spi­ralling deficits in Europe and the US as the most im­me­di­ate threat to the re­cov­ery. The fears grew af­ter Greece on Fri­day asked for a $60 bil­lion (R445bn) emer­gency bailout from the EU and IMF to help it avoid de­fault­ing on its debt. “The pri­mary risks to the global econ­omy come from de­vel­oped coun­tries,” said Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China’s cen­tral bank. “Sov­er­eign debt risk has be­come a ma­jor and real threat to global fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and eco­nomic re­cov­ery.” Greek’s request over­shad­owed many of the meet­ings of fi­nance min­is­ters last week, in­clud­ing a gath­er­ing of the Group of 20 bloc on Fri­day. Strauss-Kahn said Greece “shouldn’t fear the IMF” as they worked on im­ple­ment­ing the pack­age. But the is­sue of restor­ing “bal­ance” to the global econ­omy had also been a key topic in the past week as a se­ries of IMF re­ports noted that the world’s emer­gence from re­ces­sion was un­even. Asia is lead­ing the way as wealthy coun­tries such as the US and much of Europe con­tinue strug­gling. Span­ish Fi­nance Min­is­ter Elena Sal­gado, whose coun­try now holds the ro­tat­ing EU pres­i­dency, said: “Global im­bal­ances re­main a chal­lenge for global macroe­co­nomic and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.” “With­out an ap­pro­pri­ate mul­ti­lat­eral strat­egy to struc­turally re­duce those im­bal­ances, the strength and sus­tain­abil­ity of the re­cov­ery may be neg­a­tively af­fected.” In­dus­tri­alised na­tions are push­ing for grow­ing pow­ers such as China to boost do­mes­tic de­mand and al­low their cur­ren­cies to ap­pre­ci­ate to pro­vide a more level play­ing field in the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery. “In large emerg­ing economies, we have seen en­cour­ag­ing signs of a shift to­wards more rapid con­sump­tion growth that needs to be sus­tained and re­in­forced by a re­turn to mar­ket-ori­ented ex­change rates,” ac­cord­ing to US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Ti­mothy Gei­th­ner. The IMF has also warned that some Asian and Latin Amer­i­can economies were at risk of over­heat­ing in the near fu­ture as in­vestors be­gan pour­ing money into grow­ing emerg­ing coun­tries. Brazil­ian Fi­nance Min­is­ter Guido Man­tega said that he recog­nised the dan­ger and that de­vel­op­ing coun­tries would have to do their part to avoid al­low­ing an up­surge in in­vest­ment to cre­ate bub­bles in their own economies. “Pru­den­tial mea­sures and cap­i­tal con­trols are in­creas­ingly be­com­ing nec­es­sary to mit­i­gate these harm­ful ef­fects,” said Man­tega. THE WORLD Bank’s pri­vate­sec­tor lender ex­pected to in­vest $16 bil­lion (R118.5bn) this fis­cal year in emerg­ing coun­tries to spur eco­nomic growth amid a tepid global re­cov­ery that had pushed mil­lions of peo­ple into poverty, its chief ex­ec­u­tive said on Satur­day. “I think we would do $16bn in­clud­ing fi­nanc­ing mo­bilised from other par­ties,” Lars Thunell, the chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (IFC) said on the side­lines of meet­ings of the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund in Washington. This is an in­crease of $1.5bn from last year af­ter 64 mil­lion more peo­ple world­wide fell be­low the poverty line due to the global eco­nomic cri­sis. Thunell said con­sumer goods sec­tors in emerg­ing coun­tries with large and young pop­u­la­tions was where he saw most of the in­vest­ment go­ing. “It is not only in tra­di­tional sec­tors like ex­tract­ing (com­modi­ties) or in­fra­struc­ture, but on lo­cal con­sump­tion. You see it in China and Africa. What you call the base of the pyra­mid is a ma­jor busi­ness op­por­tu­nity,” Thunell said. He pointed to sites in western China as one area where this was hap­pen­ing. Thunell also said in­ter­est in coun­tries marred by war, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Rwanda, had risen as the po­lit­i­cal risk pro­file of these coun­tries im­proved. “You have much less con­flicts and wars in Africa.

za,Pretoria News,20200803,Yet more tooth­less rhetoric against ram­pant cor­rup­tion,"THERE is an un­der­stand­ing that the fight against cor­rup­tion in South Africa con­sists only of harsh – but tooth­less – rhetoric cou­pled with a string of com­mis­sions of in­quiry. Since the last decade com­mis­sions of in­quiry have per­sisted un­der the guise of ul­ti­mate ser­vice to­wards democ­racy and pub­lic in­ter­est. How­ever, th­ese com­mis­sions tend to take away re­sources and at­ten­tion from the main busi­ness of gov­ern­ment aimed at de­liv­ery of pub­lic goods. In South Africa, com­mis­sions of in­quiry have so far proven in­ef­fec­tive in the fight against ram­pant cor­rup­tion. It is clear that cor­rup­tion has be­come the main­stay of South African democ­racy. In fact, cor­rup­tion dis­guised un­der the veil of demo­cratic pro­ce­dures seem to have be­come a com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor among most na­tions of post-independent Africa. Re­cently, loot­ers of the Covid-19 emer­gency funds have also joined the demo­cratic pro­ce­dures route to es­cape pros­e­cu­tion. Th­ese pub­lic of­fice hold­ers have ex­posed the pub­lic to the dou­ble threat of Covid-19 and a hunger cri­sis. What is then the an­swer to the Covid-19 gravy train, in­so­lent cor­rup­tion? Well, to date, the Covid-19 cor­rup­tion has been met with the usual threat­en­ing but tooth­less rhetoric. When ev­i­dence of ram­pant cor­rup­tion is pre­sented by the me­dia, the gov­ern­ment will in­form the pub­lic that, “there will be in­ves­ti­ga­tions and those found guilty will face the full might of the law”. How­ever, to date most per­pe­tra­tors con­tinue as if noth­ing has hap­pened or they en­joy paid leave of ab­sence while wait­ing their turn at cus­tom­ary com­mis­sions of in­quiry. Un­der th­ese cir­cum­stances, how can the grass-roots pop­u­la­tion fight cor­rup­tion? Al­ready be­fore the Covid19 pan­demic the em­ploy­ment rate in South Africa was at 16 mil­lion. En­ter Covid-19, that fig­ure has added an­other 3 mil­lion within a pe­riod of four months. There seem to be no fea­si­ble so­lu­tions in sight for the greater pop­u­la­tion, but a down­ward spi­ral to­wards im­pov­er­ished ex­is­tence. Will the gov­ern­ment take the in­creased rate of un­em­ploy­ment se­ri­ously and act upon it ac­cord­ingly? Or, should we all brace our­selves for the masses to take the law into their own hands? Is South Africa ready for yet an­other bat­tle­front amid cur­rent eco­nomic and so­cial crises ex­ac­er­bated by Covid-19? What will be­come of South Africa when the masses fi­nally de­cide to fight back and de­mand what is theirs by birth right; the dig­nity of be­ing heard an re­spected? It may seem as if fail­ure of democ­racy as an in­sti­tu­tion for build­ing a co­her­ent so­cial sys­tem and nation is ap­par­ent to all in South Africa. Such a fail­ure trans­lates into hold­ers of pub­lic of­fice loot­ing state funds with in­so­lence and with­out fear of pros­e­cu­tion. Among the grass roots, the fail­ure is man­i­fested through per­va­sive in­dig­nity and be­ing con­demned to a life of liv­ing in squalor. Th­ese con­tra­dic­tions, cou­pled with the scourge of the Covid-19, con­sti­tute ex­treme so­cial crises from which there is no re­turn or amend­ment. The Cor­rup­tion Per­cep­tions In­dex, an in­dex pub­lished an­nu­ally by Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional since 1995, places South Africa at num­ber 70 out of 179 coun­tries, as the worst cor­rupt nation for the year 2019. One may calmly guess that at the cur­rent rate, South Africa will have fallen be­low the 100th po­si­tion post the Covid-19 era. China, at the height of its re­forms, which be­gan in 1978, de­vel­oped ram­pant cases of cor­rup­tion through temp­ta­tions brought by the in­tro­duc­tion to the mar­ket econ­omy. Pub­lic of­fice hold­ers and pri­vate en­ter­prise lead­ers used their po­si­tions to loot state funds and en­rich them­selves. Some pur­chased ex­pen­sive prop­erty and sent their en­tire fam­i­lies to study and live abroad. The rapid rise of China as an eco­nomic gi­ant in global mar­kets be­came a breed­ing ground for do­mes­tic, ram­pant cor­rup­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, upon his as­cent to of­fice in 2012, made the fight against cor­rup­tion his pri­or­ity and a mis­sion for the en­tire party. The anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paign was dubbed “Catch­ing Tigers and Flies”. Flies re­ferred to low-level of­fi­cials and Tigers to high-level of­fi­cials found guilty of di­verse forms of cor­rup­tion. Since then more than a mil­lion lowand high-level of­fi­cials in­clud­ing top min­is­ters, busi­ness and me­dia per­son­ages have been pros­e­cuted and pun­ished with the ma­jor­ity of the top tier re­ceiv­ing cap­i­tal pun­ish­ment. One is not sug­gest­ing in any man­ner or form that we learn from China and its sys­tem of gov­er­nance. The propo­si­tion is that we em­u­late China in serv­ing the peo­ple first. South Africans are well ca­pa­ble of fight­ing cor­rup­tion by them­selves. We do not need a for­eign power to tell us that our peo­ple are hun­gry. We do not need a for­eign power to tell us that our peo­ple are left with­out re­course against poverty. We do not need a for­eign power to teach us that seg­re­gated ge­ogra­phies of the apartheid regime are still in place. What we need to do is to link eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to our na­tional de­vel­op­ment. Un­til now we have man­aged to link eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to the Western “First World Cap­i­tal­ist” demo­cratic bench­marks. It is for that rea­son that all our ini­tia­tives have failed to de­liver pub­lic goods. May we in­stead search for ex­am­ples from suc­cess­ful na­tions be­yond cus­tom­ary Western bench­marks. May we seek lo­cal so­lu­tions to lo­cal prob­lems. The sug­ges­tion in­cludes seek­ing tools for wag­ing a war against cor­rup­tion. The rul­ing party needs to en­gage in prac­tices that help jus­tify its le­git­i­macy be­yond the yes­ter­year dogma of a bib­li­cal mis­sion of lib­er­a­tion. Cor­rup­tion in the rul­ing party im­pedes po­lit­i­cal gov­er­nance, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and in­ven­tion of a bet­ter fu­ture. In South Africa, the jury is still out with re­gards to out­comes of the next lo­cal gov­ern­ment and na­tional elec­tions. Will the peo­ple choose to have empty demo­cratic rights that en­sure that they sleep on empty stom­achs, have no clothes on their back and no roof over their head or will they take his­tory into their own hands?

The rec­om­men­da­tions were in­formed by more than 60 re­search re­ports, aug­mented by con­sul­ta­tions and a re­view of ev­i­dence. The panel found that a na­tional min­i­mum wage of R3 500 would con­trib­ute to al­le­vi­at­ing poverty with­out ad­verse ef­fects on em­ploy­ment.

Nev­er­the­less, de­bate on whether a higher min­i­mum wage will neg­a­tively af­fect em­ploy­ment con­tin­ues. One school of thought be­lieves that, by lift­ing min­i­mum wages, job losses will be un­avoid­able. In fact, the Na­tional Trea­sury has stated that the pro­posed min­i­mum will re­sult in 715 000 jobs be­ing shed, and shave more than 2% off eco­nomic growth. This could be ex­ac­er­bated by in­creased mech­a­ni­sa­tion. An­other ar­gu­ment against the higher min­i­mum wage is that prof­its have come un­der se­vere pres­sure re­cently due to weak eco­nomic growth and ris­ing in­put costs, in­clud­ing re­silient em­ployee com­pen­sa­tion growth. The caveat is that most of the gains seem to have ac­crued to higher-in­come groups. Nev­er­the­less, the ar­gu­ment is that the gap be­tween profit and wage growth must close to en­sure the sus­tain­abil­ity of pri­vate en­ter­prise. Ris­ing labour costs may also re­duce in­ter­na­tional com­pet­i­tive­ness and have an ad­verse im­pact on ex­port growth. The at­tempt to di­ver­sify our ex­port base through in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and re­duce the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of the do­mes­tic busi­ness cy­cle to ex­ter­nal shocks would also be in­hib­ited. By con­trast, sup­port­ers of a higher min­i­mum wage em­pha­sise cor­rectly that a sus­tain­able so­ci­ety needs a liv­ing wage that can cover ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties. While a na­tional monthly min­i­mum wage of R3 500 is pro­posed, the work­ing poverty line is es­ti­mated to be R4 317 a month. Fur­ther, in­equal­ity in South Africa is ris­ing. There­fore, such a pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion can pro­tect those most vul­ner­a­ble to ad­verse eco­nomic con­di­tions, par­tic­u­larly in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment. It could also po­ten­tially catal­yse growth by nudg­ing more money to low-in­come house­holds, which have a higher propen­sity to spend. This would bol­ster do­mes­tic de­mand. A great deal of in­ter­na­tional ev­i­dence on the topic re­veals that a sen­si­ble min­i­mum wage can re­duce in­come in­equal­ity and al­le­vi­ate poverty with­out com­pro­mis­ing eco­nomic growth. Re­cent lit­er­a­ture in Brazil has found that a min­i­mum wage has a neg­li­gi­ble im­pact on over­all em­ploy­ment. In China, min­i­mum wages im­proved pro­duc­tiv­ity with­out in­cur­ring ad­verse ef­fects on em­ploy­ment. How­ever, dif­fer­ent sec­tors were af­fected dif­fer­ently. For ex­am­ple, a min­i­mum wage in China’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try pro­duced ad­verse ef­fects on em­ploy­ment but was pos­i­tive in the con­struc­tion sec­tor. For South Africa, which is char­ac­terised by ex­treme and grow­ing in­equal­ity, a well-de­signed na­tional min­i­mum-wage pro­gramme that mit­i­gates against job losses by tak­ing into ac­count the nu­ances of dif­fer­ent in­dus­tries would likely have a net pos­i­tive out­come.

It needs an at­ti­tude of peo­ple­cen­tred de­vel­op­ment RE­CENTLY China opened the world’s long­est sea bridge. Of­fi­cially called the Hong Kong-Ma­cau-Zhuhai bridge, the struc­ture, which cost $20 bil­lion (about R285bn), is about 55km long and while for the most part it crosses water, it also has a 7km tun­nel. The con­struc­tion of the bridge took eight years, and now con­nects main­land China (Zhuhai) to the semi­au­tonomous re­gions of Hong Kong and Ma­cau. Be­fore the bridge was built, it took three hours to travel be­tween Zhuhai and Hong Kong. Now it takes 30 min­utes. By build­ing this bridge it is sug­gested that Beijing seeks to en­sure that the Greater Bay Area be­comes a tech­no­log­i­cal and in­no­va­tion-fo­cused zone. Au­thor­i­ties in Beijing sug­gest that by 2030, nearly 30 000 ve­hi­cles and nearly 130 000 pas­sen­ger trips would utilise the bridge daily. Most im­por­tantly, it in­te­grates the three ter­ri­to­ries and gives life to the “One China” pol­icy. China, a de­vel­op­ing coun­try once plagued with op­pres­sion, in­equal­ity, dis­ease, famine and poverty, has now emerged as a de­vel­oped na­tion. As we en­ter a new phase of glob­al­i­sa­tion and with the on­set of the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, at the 13th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress in 2017, in­tro­duced the Xi Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era. Meet­ing with 13 African heads of state on the side­lines of his first BRICS Sum­mit in SA in 2013, Xi em­pha­sised the need for in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture on the African con­ti­nent. This is not far from the em­pha­sis placed on the in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture by the AU’s Agenda 2063. By us­ing it­self as a roadmap, China, Xi pointed out, wished to en­sure that African peo­ple them­selves were in­ter­con­nected and en­abled to con­nect with each other. A number of ex­press high­ways have been ini­ti­ated and built on the African con­ti­nent. For ex­am­ple, the $476m ex­press high­way be­tween Kam­pala and En­tebbe in Uganda, and the Omakange and Rua­cana road up­grade in Namibia. Sadly, SA’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem is not a peo­ple-centred op­er­a­tion. Even the last mega projects, the Gau­train and the roads in Gaut­eng, have sadly placed profit and “sus­tain­abil­ity” as core pri­or­i­ties. In par­tic­u­lar, Prasa and Metro­rail have had a chal­lenge with the on­slaught of at­tacks against their rail­way in­fra­struc­ture in the Western Cape. Metro­rail, to­gether with na­tional, provin­cial and lo­cal gov­ern­ment, has launched the rail­way en­force­ment unit in Cape Town. Ac­cord­ing to news re­ports, the pri­or­ity of this unit is not the safety of com­muters, but rather “pro­tect­ing rail in­fra­struc­ture and sta­bil­is­ing train ser­vices”. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices, it would seem that SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude from those man­ag­ing our pub­lic trans­port sys­tem not to sim­ply main­tain old lega­cies, but to build new ones for the peo­ple. For this is what peo­ple-centred de­vel­op­ment is ul­ti­mately about.",南非
za,Cape Times,20101115,Roubini sees Africa as best al­ter­na­tive to Bric mar­kets,"FUND man­agers should con­sider African mar­kets such as Ghana, Kenya, Nige­ria and Tan­za­nia rather than chas­ing crowded emerg­ing mar­ket trades else­where, econ­o­mist Nouriel Roubini said on Fri­day. “It (Africa) is risky be­cause there is less liq­uid­ity and the gov­er­nance is not ideal. But in com­par­i­son to 10 years ago when there was civil strife and un­sta­ble gov­ern­ments, many things have im­proved.” Roubini, a pro­fes­sor of eco­nom­ics and in­ter­na­tional busi­ness at the Stern School of Busi­ness in New York, is best known for fore­cast­ing the credit crunch. He was not as op­ti­mistic as those who see sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa as the next mem­ber of Bric (the bloc of Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China), cit­ing fun­da­men­tal prob­lems of dis­ease, poverty and a lack of hu­man and phys­i­cal cap­i­tal, but he said Africa was an al­ter­na­tive for in­vestors be­com­ing wary of toppy main­stream emerg­ing mar­kets. Roubini, speak­ing to Reuters on the side­lines of the CFA In­sti­tute’s Euro­pean In­vest­ment Con­fer­ence, said a wall of money was rush­ing in­dis­crim­i­nately into emerg­ing mar­kets such as China, In­dia and In­done­sia, with in­vestors fail­ing to look closely at un­der­ly­ing fun­da­men­tals. Ac­cord­ing to Lip­per FMI, Euro­pean-domi­ciled emerg­ing mar­ket bond funds alone have achieved net sales of 9.5 bil­lion (R90.5bn) this year, with emerg­ing mar­ket eq­uity funds win­ning net sales of 15.6bn. Roubini was par­tic­u­larly wary of In­dian eq­ui­ties, where val­u­a­tions were be­com­ing dis­con­nected from fun­da­men­tals, and South Africa, where the rand looked over-stretched. So-called fron­tier or ex­otic mar­kets such as those in sub­Sa­ha­ran Africa were in vogue just prior to the credit crunch but a lack of liq­uid­ity and in­vestable as­sets have hin­dered devel­op­ment. – Reuters",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20180301,How we can help save our coun­try,"LIS­TEN­ING to Malusi Gi­gaba’s first and last Bud­get speech, with his new teleprompters hid­den be­hind a mini jun­gle of green­ery, de­liv­ered in a mono­tone, was per­haps sym­bolic of the body politic be­hind the words and mes­sage. The ANC is in­ca­pable of arous­ing the col­lec­tive imag­i­na­tion of the coun­try, some­thing we need if we are to avoid the abyss which the Zuma/Gupta/state cap­ture necro­sis pushed us to.

I was hop­ing Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa would have re­moved Zupta-stained Gi­gaba be­fore the Bud­get speech, and re­placed him with some­one ex­pe­ri­enced in fi­nance. I hope Ramaphosa will be man enough to cast a wide net in ap­point­ing new cabinet min­is­ters to re­place the rot­ten corpses he in­her­ited. A true leader would look to a mul­ti­par­ti­san cabinet that com­prises some of the best peo­ple in the coun­try. Sim­i­larly, when he gets to clear­ing out the rot in the state-owned en­ter­prises (SOEs), he should in a like­wise fash­ion ap­point smart, ex­pe­ri­enced in­di­vid­u­als, re­gard­less of po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion. The Bud­get speech was patently a vote-gar­ner­ing gam­bit and not di­rected at what South Africa needs to get us on track to be­com­ing a win­ning, pro­gres­sive na­tion. Coun­tries like In­dia, China, South Korea, Thai­land, have gone from be­ing dirt poorto one on the road to pros­per­ity. China has taken about 800 mil­lion of its cit­i­zens out of poverty in the past 20 years, while Africa has put 600 mil­lion into poverty dur­ing the same pe­riod. When Ramaphosa said we have a plan – the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Plan, he should have said we would look at the China and Korea of 20 or 30 years ago and do what they did. We need to en­sure high qual­ity train­ing and ed­u­ca­tion, and forgo our sloth­ful- ness and ten­dency to­wards lib­eral medioc­racy. As a na­tion, we must pre­pare our­selves to work long, hard hours for less than we think we are worth. Our children will reap the rich re­wards as the children in China and Korea are do­ing. We in Africa are do­ing some­thing wrong. No one owes us any­thing. All coun­tries have a his­tory of con­flict, wars of sub­ju­ga­tion, lib­er­a­tion and eman­ci­pa­tion. Win­ning coun­tries are those that get over the his­tory with­out look­ing to the past for the rec­ti­fi­ca­tion of the present. Ger­many, Ja­pan and China were flat­tened in “our” life­time. They worked and built up win­ning na­tions. In his State of the Na­tion ad­dress, Ramaphosa failed to men­tion the need for South Africans to rise to the oc­ca­sion. The Bud­get made a big deal of free higher ed­u­ca­tion. The coun­try is al­most broke and yet we are pre­pared to com­mit about R50 bil­lion for free ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion, some­thing First World, rich coun­tries can’t man­age. What worth is a de­gree that re­quires a 30% pass mark? That was a cheap scam to win votes. Why did the Bud­get not an­nounce that all high school leavers with marks above a cer­tain grade, say 75%, would be en­ti­tled to state bur­saries? Clever in­cen­tives could en­cour­age more stu­dents to lean to­wards maths and science. We are pro­duc­ing un­em­ploy­able grad­u­ates who are func­tion­ally in­ca­pable, nu­mer­i­cally il­lit­er­ate and, in many cases, un­em­ploy­able. . We need a new cul­ture in the teach­ing pro­fes­sion; one of self-sac­ri­fice and pro­fes­sional ded­i­ca­tion. The South Africa Demo­cratic Teach­ers Union has ru­ined the teach­ing pro­fes­sion. This needs fix­ing ur­gently. Throw­ing money at it and is­su­ing worth­less cer­tifi­cates is not the an­swer. Some­thing to con­tem­plate for the com­ing few years: Sell 10% eq­uity of all SOE ev­ery year for the next four to eight years and ul­ti­mately re­duce state own­er­ship to 0%. If al­lowed to op­er­ate as listed com­pa­nies, the likes of Transnet, SAA, the SABC and Eskom – would be profit cen­tres, net em­ploy­ers and con­trib­u­tors to the fis­cus. Put ed­u­ca­tion into the pri­vate sec­tor which pro­duces most of the top rankers ev­ery year. Put the health sys­tem un­der pri­vate own­er­ship.

za,The Star Early Edition,20150615,Africa needs to fol­low in China’s foot­steps to achieve higher rates,"WHEN you are look­ing over the beau­ti­ful At­lantic Ocean from the har­bour in Cape Town, host city of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa 2015, it is easy to con­vince your­self that Africa’s longterm out­look is pos­i­tive. A num­ber of fac­tors are pulling it in the right di­rec­tion. The top 10 per­form­ing African coun­tries have a com­bined growth rate that av­er­aged 7.6 per­cent over the past decade. Nige­ria, Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozam­bique, An­gola and Zam­bia also have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of around 700 mil­lion peo­ple. Even over the past five years, hardly a be­nign en­vi­ron­ment, growth has been 6.6 per­cent. Th­ese stats are im­pres­sive. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that pop­u­la­tion growth has been around 2.5 per­cent year on year, which means that per capita growth has been run­ning at around 5 per­cent. A 5 per­cent rate of growth means that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita will more than dou­ble in the next 20 years and that in 30 years, GDP in th­ese coun­tries will be where Morocco and Ja­maica are to­day; in 40 years they will reach the same level as In­done­sia in 2014. There will be progress, but not a rapid Asian-es­que trans­for­ma­tion. If Africa’s top 10 were able to match Asia’s growth rate – closer to 7 per­cent GDP per capita (im­ply­ing a 10 per­cent year-on-year GDP growth rate for the next decade be­fore pop­u­la­tion growth be­gins to de­cel­er­ate) – then they would be able to turn them­selves into Colom­bia and Thai­land in 30 years and to Es­to­nia and the Czech Repub­lic in 40. Africa is grow­ing fast, much faster than it did in the 1980s or 1990s, but the growth rate has to ac­cel­er­ate to de­liver what China and the south-east Asian tigers have done. Africa needs to find a road that leads to the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. Chang­ing growth mod­els With the fall in com­mod­ity prices, the ques­tion of how to boost growth is back at the top of the agenda. But there are rea­sons to be bear­ish on a quick re­cov­ery in the com­modi­ties mar­ket. China is chang­ing its growth model and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set the coun­try on a more sus­tain­able course. Mean­while, other fast-grow­ing Asian na­tions like In­dia, In­done­sia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines will not be as re­source­hun­gry as China be­cause the sub­si­dies for in­ten­sive con­sump­tion in a man­u­fac­tur­ing-driven growth model are not there. They will con­sume nat­u­ral re­sources, but not at the same pace or rate as China. This puts the brakes on Africa’s com­mod­ity-driven turbo growth, which is a chal­lenge. But I still think it’s pos­si­ble to in­crease growth to Asian lev­els. This will de­pend to a larger de­gree on the abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to im­ple­ment struc­tural re­forms. The road to 10 per­cent growth must be forged within Africa. Op­por­tu­nity to re­form To many, the elec­tion re­sult in Nige­ria came as a sur­prise. But from an­other per­spec­tive, the change of gov­ern­ment from Good­luck Jonathan to Muham­madu Buhari was a sign that Africa is ma­tur­ing. When peo­ple are si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­com­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated and more ur­banised, while in­for­ma­tion flows more freely and hu­man rights is­sues are at the fore­front, it is nat­u­ral that there will be more regular tran­si­tions be­tween gov­ern­ments. You can hardly hold Jonathan re­spon­si­ble for the col­lapse of the oil price, but Nige­ria could have done more to build buf­fers against the var­i­ous crises fac­ing the coun­try. The con­flict with Boko Haram has es­ca­lated in the north, im­port prices have been pushed up by the de­pre­ci­a­tion of the naira, cor­rup­tion is high and poverty re­duc­tion has been slower than in other coun­tries. It could be ar­gued that the best thing for Nige­ria now would be if Jonathan joins for­mer pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo as a re­spected leader in a peer role. Mean­while, if Buhari can as­sume the role of eco­nomic re­former, then this will be a game-changer. Low oil prices can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to re­form en­ergy sub­si­dies, as Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has done in In­done­sia, to strengthen public fi­nances. The fact that naira has de­pre­ci­ated heav­ily could be used as an op­por­tu­nity to open up and di­ver­sify the econ­omy. Nige­rian in­dus­try must be much more com­pet­i­tive so tar­iffs and a myr­iad of bar­ri­ers to trade can be dis­man­tled. The weak cur­rency could also boost prof­itabil­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and be­come a build­ing block for more in­clu­sive growth that does a bet­ter job of re­duc­ing poverty. A sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety is to end ‘win­ner-takes-all’ democ­racy and the con­cept of an ‘our turn to eat’ po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. If this can be­come the norm, then Africa will take a huge step to­wards reach­ing 10 per­cent growth. Lessons from China There have been con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ing role in Africa. Let me take the op­po­site po­si­tion. China’s econ­omy grew by 10 per­cent year on year for four decades, and the coun­try achieved the fastest trans­for­ma­tion from poverty to pros­per­ity. Africa needs to be­come more Chi­nese. Here are four rea­sons why: China let mar­ket forces work in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. The house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem – which gave house­holds rel­a­tive au­ton­omy over land and crops – and sub­se­quent re­forms led to 15 per­cent an­nual growth in agri­cul­ture over the years that fol­lowed. When the same hap­pens in Africa, with the dereg­u­la­tion of cof­fee in Rwanda an ex­am­ple, the re­sults will come. China did its best to pro­tect com­pet­i­tive­ness by push­ing its cur­rency to an ar­ti­fi­cially low level. A weak cur­rency is of­ten good for farm­ers who ex­port their pro­duce but prob­lem­atic for im­porters in ur­ban ar­eas. Some­times, for ex­am­ple, if a gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in its ur­ban ar­eas, a strong cur­rency to sub­sidise food im­ports seems log­i­cal, although it does hurt the ma­jor­ity of farm­ers. But an ar­ti­fi­cially weak cur­rency – even if it might up­set the US and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) – is es­sen­tial for an ex­port-led growth model and only ex­port ori­en­ta­tion can bring about 10 per­cent growth. African cur­ren­cies are now weak. Keep them weak and use this as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out struc­tural re­forms and re­move bar­ri­ers to trade. China has forced up its sav­ings rate. It peaked at 50 per­cent be­fore the cri­sis and in the mid-1990s it hov­ered around 40 per­cent. To some ex­tent this has been a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of a weak ex­change rate, low in­ter­est rates and fi­nan­cial re­pres­sion. With high sav­ings rates it’s also pos­si­ble to mo­bilise the nec­es­sary do­mes­tic cap­i­tal to sus­tain high in­vest­ment rates. Sav­ings rates in the Asian growth mir­a­cle coun­tries have in gen­eral been high and in­vest­ment lev­els are of­ten be­tween 30 per­cent to 40 per­cent of GDP. No coun­try has grown for a sus­tained pe­riod with­out in­vest­ment above 30 per­cent of GDP, but the sav­ings rate in Africa is more of­ten close to 20 per­cent. Of course, high in­vest­ment brings with it a risk of large cur­rent ac­count deficits and the dan­ger that a coun­try could run into a bal­ance of pay­ments cri­sis. High do­mes­tic sav­ings counter that risk. An es­sen­tial fea­ture of the Chi­nese road to 10 per­cent growth is open­ness to tech­nol­ogy. Tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions are slow and costly. The good news, how­ever, is that you don’t need to in­no­vate; you can just copy at very low cost. This is the Silk Road to a 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. It’s pos­si­ble for Africa’s top 10 coun­tries to move in this di­rec­tion, but there are ma­jor ob­sta­cles to over­come. The macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment has re­cently taken a more chal­leng­ing turn. The cur­rency tur­moil that will prob­a­bly fol­low the Fed­eral Re­serve’s de­ci­sion to in­crease rates will also af­fect Africa.",南非

As a na­tion, we must pre­pare our­selves to work long, hard hours for less than we think we are worth. Our chil­dren will reap the rich re­wards as the chil­dren in China and Ko­rea are do­ing. We in Africa are do­ing some­thing wrong. No one owes us any­thing. All coun­tries have a his­tory of con­flict, wars of sub­ju­ga­tion, lib­er­a­tion and eman­ci­pa­tion. Win­ning coun­tries are those that get over the his­tory with­out look­ing to the past for the rec­ti­fi­ca­tion of the present. Ger­many, Ja­pan and China were flat­tened in “our” life­time. They worked and built up win­ning na­tions. In his State of the Na­tion ad­dress, Ramaphosa failed to men­tion the need for South Africans to rise to the oc­ca­sion. The Bud­get made a big deal of free higher ed­u­ca­tion. The coun­try is al­most broke and yet we are pre­pared to com­mit about R50 bil­lion for free ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion, some­thing First World, rich coun­tries can’t man­age. What worth is a de­gree that re­quires a 30% pass mark? That was a cheap scam to win votes. Why did the Bud­get not an­nounce that all high school leavers with marks above a cer­tain grade, say 75%, would be en­ti­tled to state bur­saries? Clever in­cen­tives could en­cour­age more stu­dents to lean to­wards maths and sci­ence. We are pro­duc­ing un­em­ploy­able grad­u­ates who are func­tion­ally in­ca­pable, nu­mer­i­cally il­lit­er­ate and, in many cases, un­em­ploy­able. . We need a new cul­ture in the teach­ing pro­fes­sion; one of self-sac­ri­fice and pro­fes­sional ded­i­ca­tion. The South Africa Demo­cratic Teach­ers Union has ru­ined the teach­ing pro­fes­sion. This needs fix­ing ur­gently. Throw­ing money at it and is­su­ing worth­less cer­tifi­cates is not the an­swer. Some­thing to con­tem­plate for the com­ing few years: Sell 10% eq­uity of all SOE every year for the next four to eight years and ul­ti­mately re­duce state own­er­ship to 0%. If al­lowed to op­er­ate as listed com­pa­nies, the likes of Transnet, SAA, the SABC and Eskom – would be profit cen­tres, net em­ploy­ers and con­trib­u­tors to the fis­cus. Put ed­u­ca­tion into the pri­vate sec­tor which pro­duces most of the top rankers every year. Put the health sys­tem un­der pri­vate own­er­ship. Free ed­u­ca­tion at all lev­els with the achieve­ment of cer­tain lev­els of com­pe­tence. Make ed­u­ca­tion worth some­thing. Re­duce the bloated, fes­ter­ing cabi­net by half Im­pose hefty fines on trade unions that em­bark on un­pro­tected strikes, and puni­tive fines for dam­age to prop­erty. Land is a big is­sue but pro­duc­tive farm land is more of an is­sue for our sur­vival. The gov­ern­ment can give free­hold ti­tle to the mil­lions of hectares of land that it owns. Pro­vide new land own­ers with the tools and know-how to farm new land. We are a food-scarce coun­try and a food im­porter. We need to keep pro­duc­tive farm land in the hands of farm­ers who know how. Farm land must stay pro­duc­tive at all costs. Park­town North, Joburg",南非
za,The Star Early Edition,20150615,Africa needs to fol­low in China’s foot­steps to achieve higher rates,"WHEN you are look­ing over the beau­ti­ful At­lantic Ocean from the har­bour in Cape Town, host city of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa 2015, it is easy to con­vince your­self that Africa’s longterm out­look is pos­i­tive. A num­ber of fac­tors are pulling it in the right di­rec­tion. The top 10 per­form­ing African coun­tries have a com­bined growth rate that av­er­aged 7.6 per­cent over the past decade. Nige­ria, Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozam­bique, An­gola and Zam­bia also have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of around 700 mil­lion peo­ple. Even over the past five years, hardly a be­nign en­vi­ron­ment, growth has been 6.6 per­cent. Th­ese stats are im­pres­sive. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that pop­u­la­tion growth has been around 2.5 per­cent year on year, which means that per capita growth has been run­ning at around 5 per­cent. A 5 per­cent rate of growth means that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita will more than dou­ble in the next 20 years and that in 30 years, GDP in th­ese coun­tries will be where Morocco and Ja­maica are to­day; in 40 years they will reach the same level as In­done­sia in 2014. There will be progress, but not a rapid Asian-es­que trans­for­ma­tion. If Africa’s top 10 were able to match Asia’s growth rate – closer to 7 per­cent GDP per capita (im­ply­ing a 10 per­cent year-on-year GDP growth rate for the next decade be­fore pop­u­la­tion growth be­gins to de­cel­er­ate) – then they would be able to turn them­selves into Colom­bia and Thai­land in 30 years and to Es­to­nia and the Czech Repub­lic in 40. Africa is grow­ing fast, much faster than it did in the 1980s or 1990s, but the growth rate has to ac­cel­er­ate to de­liver what China and the south-east Asian tigers have done. Africa needs to find a road that leads to the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. Chang­ing growth mod­els With the fall in com­mod­ity prices, the ques­tion of how to boost growth is back at the top of the agenda. But there are rea­sons to be bear­ish on a quick re­cov­ery in the com­modi­ties mar­ket. China is chang­ing its growth model and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set the coun­try on a more sus­tain­able course. Mean­while, other fast-grow­ing Asian na­tions like In­dia, In­done­sia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines will not be as re­source­hun­gry as China be­cause the sub­si­dies for in­ten­sive con­sump­tion in a man­u­fac­tur­ing-driven growth model are not there. They will con­sume nat­u­ral re­sources, but not at the same pace or rate as China. This puts the brakes on Africa’s com­mod­ity-driven turbo growth, which is a chal­lenge. But I still think it’s pos­si­ble to in­crease growth to Asian lev­els. This will de­pend to a larger de­gree on the abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to im­ple­ment struc­tural re­forms. The road to 10 per­cent growth must be forged within Africa. Op­por­tu­nity to re­form To many, the elec­tion re­sult in Nige­ria came as a sur­prise. But from an­other per­spec­tive, the change of gov­ern­ment from Good­luck Jonathan to Muham­madu Buhari was a sign that Africa is ma­tur­ing. When peo­ple are si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­com­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated and more ur­banised, while in­for­ma­tion flows more freely and hu­man rights is­sues are at the fore­front, it is nat­u­ral that there will be more regular tran­si­tions be­tween gov­ern­ments. You can hardly hold Jonathan re­spon­si­ble for the col­lapse of the oil price, but Nige­ria could have done more to build buf­fers against the var­i­ous crises fac­ing the coun­try. The con­flict with Boko Haram has es­ca­lated in the north, im­port prices have been pushed up by the de­pre­ci­a­tion of the naira, cor­rup­tion is high and poverty re­duc­tion has been slower than in other coun­tries. It could be ar­gued that the best thing for Nige­ria now would be if Jonathan joins for­mer pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo as a re­spected leader in a peer role. Mean­while, if Buhari can as­sume the role of eco­nomic re­former, then this will be a game-changer. Low oil prices can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to re­form en­ergy sub­si­dies, as Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has done in In­done­sia, to strengthen public fi­nances. The fact that naira has de­pre­ci­ated heav­ily could be used as an op­por­tu­nity to open up and di­ver­sify the econ­omy. Nige­rian in­dus­try must be much more com­pet­i­tive so tar­iffs and a myr­iad of bar­ri­ers to trade can be dis­man­tled. The weak cur­rency could also boost prof­itabil­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and be­come a build­ing block for more in­clu­sive growth that does a bet­ter job of re­duc­ing poverty. A sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety is to end ‘win­ner-takes-all’ democ­racy and the con­cept of an ‘our turn to eat’ po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. If this can be­come the norm, then Africa will take a huge step to­wards reach­ing 10 per­cent growth. Lessons from China There have been con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ing role in Africa. Let me take the op­po­site po­si­tion. China’s econ­omy grew by 10 per­cent year on year for four decades, and the coun­try achieved the fastest trans­for­ma­tion from poverty to pros­per­ity. Africa needs to be­come more Chi­nese. Here are four rea­sons why: China let mar­ket forces work in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. The house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem – which gave house­holds rel­a­tive au­ton­omy over land and crops – and sub­se­quent re­forms led to 15 per­cent an­nual growth in agri­cul­ture over the years that fol­lowed. When the same hap­pens in Africa, with the dereg­u­la­tion of cof­fee in Rwanda an ex­am­ple, the re­sults will come. China did its best to pro­tect com­pet­i­tive­ness by push­ing its cur­rency to an ar­ti­fi­cially low level. A weak cur­rency is of­ten good for farm­ers who ex­port their pro­duce but prob­lem­atic for im­porters in ur­ban ar­eas. Some­times, for ex­am­ple, if a gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in its ur­ban ar­eas, a strong cur­rency to sub­sidise food im­ports seems log­i­cal, although it does hurt the ma­jor­ity of farm­ers. But an ar­ti­fi­cially weak cur­rency – even if it might up­set the US and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) – is es­sen­tial for an ex­port-led growth model and only ex­port ori­en­ta­tion can bring about 10 per­cent growth. African cur­ren­cies are now weak. Keep them weak and use this as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out struc­tural re­forms and re­move bar­ri­ers to trade. China has forced up its sav­ings rate. It peaked at 50 per­cent be­fore the cri­sis and in the mid-1990s it hov­ered around 40 per­cent. To some ex­tent this has been a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of a weak ex­change rate, low in­ter­est rates and fi­nan­cial re­pres­sion. With high sav­ings rates it’s also pos­si­ble to mo­bilise the nec­es­sary do­mes­tic cap­i­tal to sus­tain high in­vest­ment rates. Sav­ings rates in the Asian growth mir­a­cle coun­tries have in gen­eral been high and in­vest­ment lev­els are of­ten be­tween 30 per­cent to 40 per­cent of GDP. No coun­try has grown for a sus­tained pe­riod with­out in­vest­ment above 30 per­cent of GDP, but the sav­ings rate in Africa is more of­ten close to 20 per­cent. Of course, high in­vest­ment brings with it a risk of large cur­rent ac­count deficits and the dan­ger that a coun­try could run into a bal­ance of pay­ments cri­sis. High do­mes­tic sav­ings counter that risk. An es­sen­tial fea­ture of the Chi­nese road to 10 per­cent growth is open­ness to tech­nol­ogy. Tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions are slow and costly. The good news, how­ever, is that you don’t need to in­no­vate; you can just copy at very low cost. This is the Silk Road to a 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. It’s pos­si­ble for Africa’s top 10 coun­tries to move in this di­rec­tion, but there are ma­jor ob­sta­cles to over­come. The macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment has re­cently taken a more chal­leng­ing turn. The cur­rency tur­moil that will prob­a­bly fol­low the Fed­eral Re­serve’s de­ci­sion to in­crease rates will also af­fect Africa.",南非

za,Pretoria News,20150318,"China, like SA, caught in a web of cor­rup­tion","THERE’S an old Chi­nese say­ing that says: it doesn’t mat­ter if the cat is black or white, all that mat­ters is that the mouse is caught. Now that the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress (NPC) in China has wrapped up, it is time for the more than 2 000 cats – mak­ing up the largest par­lia­men­tary body in the world – to go back to their re­gions and begin the work set out by the rul­ing party for this year. Cor­rup­tion-bust­ing has been one of the key fo­cuses of this year’s NPC and the Com­mit­tee of the Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence. As part of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s war on cor­rupt “tigers and flies”, the China Com­mu­nist Party says it has brought down more than 100 000 cor­rupt of­fi­cials, many in state-owned en­ter­prises in the past two years since Xi came to power. Fear-mon­ger­ing, shor­ing up of power, or clear signs of ac­count­abil­ity? The jury is still out, here and abroad. The lat­est un­der scru­tiny is Xu Jianyi, chair­man of the China FAW Group Corp, a ma­jor car maker – he is sus­pected of “se­ri­ous vi­o­la­tions of party dis­ci­pline and the law”. In a re­port on cor­rup­tion in China, Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional said in De­cem­ber that China had, ex­cept for Turkey, fallen more than any other coun­try on its cor­rup­tion in­dex year-on-year. In­ter­na­tional banks, foun­da­tions and other or­gan­i­sa­tions con­tin­ued to be con­cerned about China’s lev­els of gov­ern­ment cor­rup­tion, said Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional. The Wall Street Jour­nal, quot­ing Pew Re­search Cen­tre data last year, said 54 per­cent of Chi­nese peo­ple con­sid­ered “cor­rup­tion among of­fi­cials a big prob­lem”. For what it’s worth, Chi­nese peo­ple – at din­ner par­ties or other so­cial func­tions – view it as a pos­i­tive that the gov­ern­ment is clamp­ing down on cor­rupt of­fi­cials. What the more than 200 mil­lion Chi­nese still living in poverty think is any­one’s guess. But what­ever its meth­ods or pur­pose at fight­ing cor­rup­tion and de­spite con­tin­ued scep­ti­cism over its poli­cies at home, the Chi­nese con­tinue apace with their “re­forms”. As the politi­cians are at pains to point out, China will con­tinue to do things its own way. Bravado backed up by an econ­omy that, while it has slowed down in re­cent times, is still set to grow at a bear-ish 7 per­cent this year – nearly more than seven times South Africa’s growth. Of South Africa, Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional said: “South Africa pos­sesses most of the in­sti­tu­tional fea­tures nec­es­sary to com­bat cor­rup­tion, no­tably a much-ad­mired Con­sti­tu­tion, an in­de­pen­dent ju­di­ciary and a ro­bust me­dia. But in most in­dices of cor­rup­tion, in­clud­ing those pro­duced by Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional, South Africa is ranked some­where in the mid­dle. “The bad news is that its rank­ing de­te­ri­o­rated for many years and has now sta­bilised at an un­sat­is­fac­tory score of 42, in­di­cat­ing a se­ri­ous prob­lem with cor­rup­tion. In the 2013 Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional Global Cor­rup­tion Barom­e­ter, 54 per­cent of the peo­ple of South Africa said cor­rup­tion is get­ting worse.” Plenty of mice, tigers and flies still to catch, here and in South Africa.

za,The Star Early Edition,20130902,In­dia needs fix­ing – fi­nan­cially and morally,"SUD­DENLY In­dia, which was cream­ing along for years with growth rates of nearly 10 per­cent, is in se­ri­ous trou­ble. Last week the ru­pee plunged to a his­toric low against the dol­lar; growth has slumped to 5 per­cent; in­ward in­vest­ment is barely 10 per­cent of China’s. And the econ­o­mists set­ting pol­icy at the Re­serve Bank of In­dia seem in a panic. In a nut­shell, their dilemma is sim­ple: Raise in­ter­est rates to restore for­eign con­fi­dence in the ru­pee and you risk chok­ing off the pal­try growth.

za,Daily News,20160323,Dis­as­ters hit Africa hard­est,"ASIA has the largest num­ber of peo­ple ex­posed to nat­u­ral dis­as­ters, but African coun­tries are the most vul­ner­a­ble to them, largely be­cause of political in­sta­bil­ity, cor­rup­tion, poverty and in­equal­ity, a new global as­sess­ment shows. In­dia has a bil­lion peo­ple at risk, with China, Bangladesh, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, Ja­pan and Pak­istan also ranked among the 10 coun­tries with the most peo­ple ex­posed to nat­u­ral haz­ards, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Verisk Maple­croft, a UK-based risk man­age­ment com­pany. In all, 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple in South Asia are ex­posed to at least one ma­jor nat­u­ral haz­ard, from se­vere storms to flood­ing and earth­quakes, re­searchers said. But the list of coun­tries most vul­ner­a­ble to dis­as­ters – in terms of their abil­ity to pre­pare for, re­spond to and re­cover from them – is topped by African na­tions, par­tic­u­larly con­flict-plagued South Su­dan, Bu­rundi and Eritrea. “Re­cent or pro­longed con­flict can erode so­ci­etal re­silience,” warned Richard Hew­ston, an an­a­lyst with Verisk Maple­croft who led the de­vel­op­ment of the nat­u­ral haz­ards data. Much vul­ner­a­bil­ity in Africa and else­where is the re­sult of poor gov­er­nance – in­clud­ing cor­rup­tion – and an in­abil­ity to im­ple­ment poli­cies to re­duce disas­ter risk, Hew­ston said. “For ex­am­ple, in In­dia and Pak­istan, to some ex­tent, there are build­ing codes in place but they are weakly im­ple­mented. You see con­struc­tion go­ing on, on the sides of land­slide-prone moun­tains or in flood plains.” “In the­ory, there’s ur­ban plan­ning,” he added. “So clearly cor­rup­tion is an is­sue.” In Ja­pan, Tai­wan and Hong Kong, more than 85% of peo­ple are ex­posed to at least one kind of nat­u­ral haz­ard, re­searchers noted. But all three coun­tries are classed as hav­ing low vul­ner­a­bil­ity, and to­gether recorded less than 32 000 deaths from nat­u­ral dis­as­ters since 1990. Haiti, on the other hand, is not as ex­posed to po­ten­tial dis­as­ters but is con­sid­ered highly vul­ner­a­ble, hav­ing suf­fered over 230 000 deaths since 1990, many in a ma­jor 2010 earth­quake. Data on cities shows Manila is the most ex­posed city, with al­most all of its 23 mil­lion peo­ple in the path of cy­clones and many also fac­ing tsunamis or earth­quakes. De­vel­op­ment Seven other ma­jor cities in Ja­pan, In­done­sia, China, Bangladesh and In­dia – par­tic­u­larly Tokyo, Jakarta and Dong­guan in China – also have large pop­u­la­tions at risk. The fast pace of de­vel­op­ment in Asian coun­tries such as Bangladesh, Pak­istan, In­dia and the Philip­pines has done lit­tle to cut that re­gion’s disas­ter risk, re­searchers noted. Some of the most vul­ner­a­ble coun­tries have shown strong eco­nomic growth, but in­fra­struc­ture and wel­fare sys­tems which could pro­tect peo­ple re­main weak, as does gov­er­nance, they said. In Nepal, for in­stance, a mas­sive 2015 earth­quake not only caused wide­spread dam­age and deaths, but cut off com­mu­ni­ca­tions and trans­port from out­ly­ing com­mu­ni­ties to the cap­i­tal. Re­duc­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity to dis­as­ters, par­tic­u­larly in places with large ex­po­sure to nat­u­ral haz­ards, will de­pend on tack­ling poverty and in­equal­ity, Hew­ston said. Pro­vid­ing education and health­care and giv­ing more peo­ple ac­cess to ser­vices can im­prove their in­comes and knowl­edge, and help them move from pre­car­i­ous places to safer ones. With losses from nat­u­ral dis­as­ters now av­er­ag­ing more than $100 bil­lion (R15.2 bil­lion) a year world­wide, busi­nesses are look­ing into ways to min­imise the threats to their fac­to­ries, work­ers and sup­ply chains.

za,Daily News,20150803,Trade with China hits R228bn SA top Africa in­vest­ment part­ner,"TRADE be­tween South Africa and China to­talled more than R228 bil­lion ($19.6bn) for the first half of this year, de­spite a frag­ile global econ­omy and slow lo­cal eco­nomic growth. This is ac­cord­ing to Rong Yan­song, Chi­nese eco­nomic and com­mer­cial coun­sel­lor to South Africa, who was a guest speaker at last Thurs­day’s Hisense Ex­port Strat­egy Con­fer­ence at La­goon Beach Ho­tel, in Mil­ner­ton, Cape Town. Hisense SA played host to a num­ber of in­ter­na­tional del­e­gates and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials at the con­fer­ence, which saw part­ners from Africa, the Mid­dle East and South Amer­ica visit Cape Town to dis­cuss trade re­la­tions and tour the firm’s At­lantis fac­tory. Yan­song said China’s cus­toms sta­tis­tics showed the trade vol­ume be­tween China and SA in the first half of the year reached more than R228bn, de­spite hav­ing de­creased by 28.2%, year-on-year, since 2009. SA is China’s 28th largest trad­ing part­ner, 29th largest ex­port mar­ket and the 10th largest im­port source. “South Africa con­tin­ues to be China’s top in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion on this con­ti­nent, with the to­tal in­vest­ment vol­ume from China ex­ceed­ing $13bn by the end of last year.” Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese Em­bassy sta­tis­tics, the lo­cal staff em­ployed by 120 larg­er­medium scale Chi­nese en­ter­prises in South Africa is more than 20 000, rep­re­sent­ing about 94% of to­tal em­ploy­ees. Yan­song said China’s in­vest­ment in SA has two ma­jor char­ac­ter­is­tics. “First, the co-op­er­a­tion on pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity be­tween our two coun­tries ap­pears to be on fast track. Sec­ond, in South Africa the Chi­nese in­vest­ment is trans­form­ing from the min­ing sec­tor to the field of man­u­fac­tur­ing, so as to help South Africa speed up its rein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process. “Over­all, China’s in­vest­ment has played a pos­i­tive role in eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment.” Nom­fu­neko Ma­jaja, chief di­rec­tor for ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing at the Depart­ment of Trade and In­dus­try (dti), said: “In ad­di­tion to some of the work un­der­taken by the dti in the last fi­nan­cial year, the depart­ment de­vel­oped a White Goods Ex­port Strat­egy to en­large South Africa’s foot­print in­ter­na­tion­ally and na­tion­ally.” She said in­creas­ing ex­ports into the SADC re­gion and other re­gional mar­kets pre­sented a clear op­por­tu­nity to grow the lo­cal white goods man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, over­com­ing the con­straints of a rel­a­tively small do­mes­tic mar­ket. Min­is­ter of Trade and In­dus­try Rob Davies, speak­ing on Fri­day, said South Africa had to make “a dent in un­em­ploy­ment and poverty”. Davies added that South Africa re­quired a new ba­sis for eco­nomic growth in or­der to move up the value chain. He said poli­cies and pro­grammes – such as the gov­ern­ment’s nine-point plan an­nounced by Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma dur­ing this year’s State of the Na­tion Ad­dress, as well as the six “I’s” – should give South Africa the im­pe­tus to achieve rad­i­cal eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. “We have the abil­ity to lo­cate our­selves some­where higher up the value chain.” Keith Pereira, Hisense South Africa’s ex­port man­ager, said African coun­tries be­long­ing to the South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC) ben­e­fited from trad­ing through the group by en­joy­ing re­duced trade rates.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20150615,Africa needs to fol­low in China’s foot­steps to achieve higher rates,"WHEN you are look­ing over the beau­ti­ful At­lantic Ocean from the har­bour in Cape Town, host city of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa 2015, it is easy to con­vince your­self that Africa’s longterm out­look is pos­i­tive. A num­ber of fac­tors are pulling it in the right di­rec­tion. The top 10 per­form­ing African coun­tries have a com­bined growth rate that av­er­aged 7.6 per­cent over the past decade. Nige­ria, Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozam­bique, An­gola and Zam­bia also have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of around 700 mil­lion peo­ple. Even over the past five years, hardly a be­nign en­vi­ron­ment, growth has been 6.6 per­cent. Th­ese stats are im­pres­sive. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that pop­u­la­tion growth has been around 2.5 per­cent year on year, which means that per capita growth has been run­ning at around 5 per­cent. A 5 per­cent rate of growth means that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita will more than dou­ble in the next 20 years and that in 30 years, GDP in th­ese coun­tries will be where Morocco and Ja­maica are to­day; in 40 years they will reach the same level as In­done­sia in 2014. There will be progress, but not a rapid Asian-es­que trans­for­ma­tion. If Africa’s top 10 were able to match Asia’s growth rate – closer to 7 per­cent GDP per capita (im­ply­ing a 10 per­cent year-on-year GDP growth rate for the next decade be­fore pop­u­la­tion growth be­gins to de­cel­er­ate) – then they would be able to turn them­selves into Colom­bia and Thai­land in 30 years and to Es­to­nia and the Czech Repub­lic in 40. Africa is grow­ing fast, much faster than it did in the 1980s or 1990s, but the growth rate has to ac­cel­er­ate to de­liver what China and the south-east Asian tigers have done. Africa needs to find a road that leads to the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. Chang­ing growth mod­els With the fall in com­mod­ity prices, the ques­tion of how to boost growth is back at the top of the agenda. But there are rea­sons to be bear­ish on a quick re­cov­ery in the com­modi­ties mar­ket. China is chang­ing its growth model and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set the coun­try on a more sus­tain­able course. Mean­while, other fast-grow­ing Asian na­tions like In­dia, In­done­sia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines will not be as re­source­hun­gry as China be­cause the sub­si­dies for in­ten­sive con­sump­tion in a man­u­fac­tur­ing­driven growth model are not there. They will con­sume nat­u­ral re­sources, but not at the same pace or rate as China. This puts the brakes on Africa’s com­mod­ity-driven turbo growth, which is a chal­lenge. But I still think it’s pos­si­ble to in­crease growth to Asian lev­els. This will de­pend to a larger de­gree on the abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to im­ple­ment struc­tural re­forms. The road to 10 per­cent growth must be forged within Africa. Op­por­tu­nity to re­form To many, the elec­tion re­sult in Nige­ria came as a sur­prise. But from an­other per­spec­tive, the change of gov­ern­ment from Good­luck Jonathan to Muham­madu Buhari was a sign that Africa is ma­tur­ing. When peo­ple are si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­com­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated and more ur­banised, while in­for­ma­tion flows more freely and hu­man rights is­sues are at the fore­front, it is nat­u­ral that there will be more regular tran­si­tions be­tween gov­ern­ments. You can hardly hold Jonathan re­spon­si­ble for the col­lapse of the oil price, but Nige­ria could have done more to build buf­fers against the var­i­ous crises fac­ing the coun­try. The con­flict with Boko Haram has es­ca­lated in the north, im­port prices have been pushed up by the de­pre­ci­a­tion of the naira, cor­rup­tion is high and poverty re­duc­tion has been slower than in other coun­tries. It could be ar­gued that the best thing for Nige­ria now would be if Jonathan joins for­mer pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo as a re­spected leader in a peer role. Mean­while, if Buhari can as­sume the role of eco­nomic re­former, then this will be a game-changer. Low oil prices can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to re­form en­ergy sub­si­dies, as Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has done in In­done­sia, to strengthen public fi­nances. The fact that naira has de­pre­ci­ated heav­ily could be used as an op­por­tu­nity to open up and di­ver­sify the econ­omy. Nige­rian in­dus­try must be much more com­pet­i­tive so tar­iffs and a myr­iad of bar­ri­ers to trade can be dis­man­tled. The weak cur­rency could also boost prof­itabil­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and be­come a build­ing block for more in­clu­sive growth that does a bet­ter job of re­duc­ing poverty. A sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety is to end ‘win­ner-takes-all’ democ­racy and the con­cept of an ‘our turn to eat’ po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. If this can be­come the norm, then Africa will take a huge step to­wards reach­ing 10 per­cent growth. Lessons from China There have been con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ing role in Africa. Let me take the op­po­site po­si­tion. China’s econ­omy grew by 10 per­cent year on year for four decades, and the coun­try achieved the fastest trans­for­ma­tion from poverty to pros­per­ity. Africa needs to be­come more Chi­nese. Here are four rea­sons why: China let mar­ket forces work in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. The house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem – which gave house­holds rel­a­tive au­ton­omy over land and crops – and sub­se­quent re­forms led to 15 per­cent an­nual growth in agri­cul­ture over the years that fol­lowed. When the same hap­pens in Africa, with the dereg­u­la­tion of cof­fee in Rwanda an ex­am­ple, the re­sults will come. China did its best to pro­tect com­pet­i­tive­ness by push­ing its cur­rency to an ar­ti­fi­cially low level. A weak cur­rency is of­ten good for farm­ers who ex­port their pro­duce but prob­lem­atic for im­porters in ur­ban ar­eas. Some­times, for ex­am­ple, if a gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in its ur­ban ar­eas, a strong cur­rency to sub­sidise food im­ports seems log­i­cal, although it does hurt the ma­jor­ity of farm­ers. But an ar­ti­fi­cially weak cur­rency – even if it might up­set the US and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) – is es­sen­tial for an ex­port-led growth model and only ex­port ori­en­ta­tion can bring about 10 per­cent growth. African cur­ren­cies are now weak. Keep them weak and use this as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out struc­tural re­forms and re­move bar­ri­ers to trade. China has forced up its sav­ings rate. It peaked at 50 per­cent be­fore the cri­sis and in the mid-1990s it hov­ered around 40 per­cent. To some ex­tent this has been a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of a weak ex­change rate, low in­ter­est rates and fi­nan­cial re­pres­sion. With high sav­ings rates it’s also pos­si­ble to mo­bilise the nec­es­sary do­mes­tic cap­i­tal to sus­tain high in­vest­ment rates. Sav­ings rates in the Asian growth mir­a­cle coun­tries have in gen­eral been high and in­vest­ment lev­els are of­ten be­tween 30 per­cent to 40 per­cent of GDP. No coun­try has grown for a sus­tained pe­riod with­out in­vest­ment above 30 per­cent of GDP, but the sav­ings rate in Africa is more of­ten close to 20 per­cent. Of course, high in­vest­ment brings with it a risk of large cur­rent ac­count deficits and the dan­ger that a coun­try could run into a bal­ance of pay­ments cri­sis. High do­mes­tic sav­ings counter that risk. An es­sen­tial fea­ture of the Chi­nese road to 10 per­cent growth is open­ness to tech­nol­ogy. Tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions are slow and costly.

Out­look for de­vel­op­ing na­tions","LON­DON: The head of Nige­ria’s cen­tral bank, Lamido Sanusi, said yes­ter­day he was pre­pared to break with a decades-old ban on for­eign takeovers of its banks in an in­ter­view with the Fi­nan­cial Times. “What we have to­day is that the cen­tral bank is not likely to sup­port a for­eign bank own­ing more than 10 per­cent of a top tier Nige­rian bank. “”hat is some­thing that in my view needs to be looked at again,” Sanusi said. He said the ban was not a le­gal re­quire­ment but pol­icy of the pre­vi­ous lead­er­ship of the Cen­tral Bank of Nige­ria. “If as gov­er­nor of cen­tral bank I am okay to have a bank owned by nom­i­nees and I don’t know who owns them, why wouldn’t I be comfortable with a bank owned by Bar­clays, or HSBC or China Construction Bank, who I know?” he added. “For me it’s a no-brainer.” – Sapa-AFP WASH­ING­TON: The World Bank slashed its out­look for de­vel­op­ing na­tions’ economies yes­ter­day, es­ti­mat­ing growth at a mea­gre 1.2 per­cent this year, while warn­ing that more mea­sures were needed for a re­cov­ery to take hold.

za,Pretoria News,20151202,Much to gain from talks with China,"AFRICAN Heads of State have ev­ery­thing to gain from their high-level di­a­logue with the Pres­i­dent of the Peo­ples’ Repub­lic (PRC) of China Xi Jin­ping and his min­is­ters this week at the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion. The PRC is set to an­nounce ma­jor de­vel­op­ment projects and fi­nanc­ing for the con­ti­nent in the com­ing days, which will as­sist the con­ti­nent in op­er­a­tional­is­ing its de­vel­op­men­tal blueprint as set out in the AU’s Agenda 2063. Like all coun­tries, the PRC is driven by its own na­tional in­ter­ests, but the Chi­nese dream of re­claim­ing na­tional pride and achiev­ing per­sonal well-be­ing dove­tails neatly with Africa’s de­vel­op­men­tal agenda. To­gether the PRC and Africa will syn­er­gise their de­vel­op­ment strate­gies and find com­ple­men­tary ways to har­ness their com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages. The Focac Sum­mit will fo­cus on im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hood, poverty re­duc­tion, in­vest­ment in the least de­vel­oped coun­tries, as well as as­sist­ing Africa with in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, food se­cu­rity, pub­lic health and dis­ease preven­tion. Th­ese are pre­cisely the im­per­a­tives that Africa needs to ad­dress with ur­gency. The fact that the PRC does not at­tach po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions to its as­sis­tance, and re­frains from in­ter­fer­ing in the do­mes­tic af­fairs of African coun­tries, sug­gests that its en­gage­ment is gen­uinely one of South-South co-op­er­a­tion. The po­ten­tial for Africa to lever­age skills, tech­nol­ogy, fi­nanc­ing and ac­cess to the PRC’s mar­ket of 1.3 bil­lion is a huge op­por­tu­nity. The fact that the PRC and the African con­ti­nent have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of more than 2.4 bil­lion, or one third of the world pop­u­la­tion, sug­gests that con­certed eco­nomic col­lab­o­ra­tion could reap mas­sive div­i­dends. If our re­la­tion­ship with the PRC can re­sult in all African cap­i­tals be­ing linked by rail, ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion hubs es­tab­lished to add value to our raw ma­te­ri­als, mod­ern health in­fra­struc­ture es­tab­lished so that we can ef­fec­tively re­spond to epi­demics, and low-end in­dus­tries set up to pro­vide em­ploy­ment, we will have joined hands with the right de­vel­op­ment part­ner.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20171107,Plan­ning for a beau­ti­ful China,"THE COM­MU­NIST Party of China (CPC) suc­cess­fully con­vened its 19th Na­tional Congress in Bei­jing, China from Oc­to­ber 18 to 24. This was an ex­tremely im­por­tant meet­ing for both China and the world – al­most 900 con­grat­u­la­tory let­ters were re­ceived from lead­ers of states and po­lit­i­cal par­ties from around the world, in­clud­ing from Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma, the ANC, the SACP, and many other African lead­ers and par­ties. More than 2 000 jour­nal­ists from more than 134 coun­tries and re­gions trav­elled to Bei­jing to cover the event. WHERE IS THERE FOR CHINA TO GO AND HOW TO GET THERE? After decades of de­vel­op­ment of so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, China has emerged as a ma­jor de­vel­op­ing coun­try. Its per capita gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) has in­creased from $156 in 1978 to more than $8 000 last year, cre­at­ing fun­da­men­tal changes in China’s eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. The congress ob­served and an­a­lysed the changes and made two key judg­ments: the prin­ci­pal con­tra­dic­tion of Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved into the one be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life, whereas pre­vi­ously, it was the one be­tween the ever-grow­ing ma­te­rial and cul­tural needs of the peo­ple and the back­ward­ness of so­cial pro­duc­tion; so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics has en­tered a new era. Based on the two judg­ments, the congress has drawn up an im­pres­sive blue­print for the new era. By 2020, we will se­cure a de­ci­sive suc­cess in build­ing a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects, mean­ing as the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try, China will erad­i­cate poverty from its en­tire pop­u­la­tion of 1.4 bil­lion, leav­ing no one be­hind. It is es­ti­mated that by 2020, per cap­i­tal GDP in China will reach $10 000. The congress has drawn up a two-stage over­all de­vel­op­ment plan from 2021 to the mid­dle of the cen­tury. From 2021 to 2035, we will re­alise so­cial­ist mod­erni­sa­tion, with es­ti­mated per capita GDP at $30 000, reach­ing the level of a mod­er­ately de­vel­oped coun­try. From 2036 to mid-21st cen­tury, we will de­velop China into a mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try that is pros­per­ous, strong, demo­cratic, cul­tur­ally ad­vanced, har­mo­nious and beau­ti­ful. For the first time China has put “a beau­ti­ful China” in our de­vel­op­ment vi­sion, demon­strat­ing China’s as­pi­ra­tion for a bet­ter world and its wish to con­trib­ute an earnest part in our joint ef­forts to ad­dress cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. With such an am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment blue­print, the CPC well recog­nises the ne­ces­sity for a guid­ing thought to unite the ef­forts of the Chi­nese peo­ple and a strong and ca­pa­ble lead­er­ship to re­alise the vi­sion. The congress has es­tab­lished the his­tor­i­cal po­si­tion of the Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era as a guid­ing thought and ba­sic pol­icy to unite and lead our party and peo­ple in or­der to up­hold and de­velop so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics in the new era. The congress has elected a new gen­er­a­tion of the CPC cen­tral lead­er­ship with Gen­eral Sec­re­tary Xi Jin­ping at its core. Those in lead­er­ship are ex­tremely com­pe­tent – they have been tested through years of ex­cel­lence in gov­er­nance, they have been elected through an ex­tremely strict vot­ing process out of 89 mil­lion CPC mem­bers and they have been closely ex­am­ined time and again to en­sure they have the high­est in­tegrity of hold­ing of­fice. Most im­por­tantly, the lead­er­ship is of un­par­al­leled unity, with Xi at its core, and united and guided by the Xi Jin­ping Thought. With this high level of unity, we get the max­i­mum re­sults when com­bin­ing our strengths into ac­tion. The fu­ture prospect for China is in­deed bright and en­cour­ag­ing. A PEO­PLE-CEN­TERED AP­PROACH: FO­CUS OUR EF­FORTS ON THE AS­PI­RA­TION OF THE PEO­PLE TO LIVE A BET­TER LIFE. As China marches con­fi­dently and com­fort­ably to­wards its new de­vel­op­ment goals, we are con­stantly re­minded by our motto “re­main true to our orig­i­nal as­pi­ra­tion, keep our mis­sion firmly in mind”. The “orig­i­nal as­pi­ra­tion and the mis­sion of Chi­nese Com­mu­nists”, in the words by Xi, is “to seek hap­pi­ness for the Chi­nese peo­ple and re­ju­ve­na­tion for the Chi­nese na­tion”. Since its foun­da­tion, the CPC has main­tained its fun­da­men­tal pur­pose of serv­ing peo­ple whole­heart­edly. Up­hold­ing the firm be­lief that the CPC – a party of the peo­ple, for the peo­ple and by the peo­ple – is al­ways com­mit­ted to a peo­ple-cen­tered ap­proach, al­ways puts the in­ter­est of the peo­ple first, and al­ways strives to en­sure the achieve­ments of eco­nomic and so­cial progress should be and must be shared by the en­tire pop­u­la­tion in­stead of only small, in­vested in­ter­est groups. Over the past five years, the CPC with Com­rade Xi at its core has re­mained stead­fast to the peo­ple-cen­tered ap­proach and has solved many tough prob­lems that were long on the agenda but never re­solved. It wants to en­sure we ac­com­plish many things that were wanted but were never done, such as anti-cor­rup­tion, en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, food safety, and many oth­ers, win­ning the party strong sup­port among the Chi­nese peo­ple. The CPC has com­mit­ted and will con­tinue to com­mit it­self to the peo­ple-cen­tered ap­proach be­cause of its deep con­vic­tion that the peo­ple are mak­ers of his­tory. The CPC comes from the peo­ple and will not and dare not for­get the peo­ple. This deep con­vic­tion is what in­spires the CPC to keep grow­ing, pros­per­ing and keep mov­ing from one suc­cess to another suc­cess. A NEW TYPE OF IN­TER­NA­TIONAL RE­LA­TIONS AND A COM­MU­NITY OF A SHARED FU­TURE FOR MANKIND. As a re­spon­si­ble and ma­jor mem­ber of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, China al­ways val­ues its re­la­tions with the world and com­mits to mak­ing it a bet­ter place. The congress has main­tained this con­sis­tency and com­mit­ment, and has put for­ward our vi­sion for the world in a new era: China will pur­sue a new type of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions fea­tur­ing mu­tual re­spect, fair­ness, jus­tice, and win-win co-op­er­a­tion, and will work with peo­ples of all coun­tries to build a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind, which is an open, in­clu­sive, clean and beau­ti­ful world that en­joys last­ing peace, univer­sal se­cu­rity and com­mon pros­per­ity. China calls for mu­tual re­spect for sovereignty and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, mu­tual re­spect for one another’s core in­ter­ests and ma­jor con­cerns, mu­tual re­spect for the di­ver­sity of hu­man civil­i­sa­tion, and mu­tual re­spect for one another’s in­de­pen­dent choice on so­cial sys­tems and de­vel­op­ment paths. China is com­mit­ted to a so­cial­ist path with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics. As we of­fer our re­spect to the in­de­pen­dent choice by the peo­ple of other coun­tries, China nat- urally looks for­ward to the same re­spect from other coun­tries. Through fair­ness and jus­tice, China is com­mit­ted to stronger rep­re­sen­ta­tion and big­ger voice of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in the UN and other mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums. China will take a more ac­tive part in global gov­er­nance, make greater con­tri­bu­tions in in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance, peace­keep­ing and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity, and join ef­forts with de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to bring about a more demo­cratic in­ter­na­tional or­der and make the in­ter­na­tional gov­er­nance regime more fair, just and rea­son­able. By win-win co-op­er­a­tion, China in­tends to re­main com­mit­ted to the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests, and to closely com­bine China’s de­vel­op­ment with the de­vel­op­ment of the world. China will con­tinue to pro­mote in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion of the Belt and Road ini­tia­tive. To nar­row the gap be­tween the North and the South, China will in­crease more as­sis­tance for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly the least de­vel­oped coun­tries. Opening up will re­main China’s ba­sic pol­icy, and China will con­tinue its ef­forts for an open world econ­omy, and make glob­al­i­sa­tion more open, in­clu­sive, bal­anced and win-win. In our vi­sion for a new world, China ex­pressed its strong re­solve to jointly build a world of last­ing peace and univer­sal se­cu­rity. It would re­quire all coun­tries to aban­don the tra­di­tional in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics of zero-sum game and the law of the jun­gle, and res­o­lutely re­ject any coun­try to pur­sue “ab­so­lute se­cu­rity”. China will con­tinue to up­hold its fun­da­men­tal for­eign pol­icy goal of pre­serv­ing world peace and pro­mot­ing com­mon de­vel­op­ment. We are con­fi­dent that China’s con­tin­ued pros­per­ity will of­fer to the world, par­tic­u­larly to the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, a new path and op­por­tu­ni­ties to mod­erni­sa­tion and an an­swer to search for a bet­ter so­cial sys­tem. A BRIGHTER FU­TURE FOR MORE FRUIT­FUL AND MU­TU­ALLY BEN­E­FI­CIAL CHINA-SOUTH AFRICA RE­LA­TIONS. The China-South Africa com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship main­tains ro­bust mo­men­tum with un­prece­dented height and warmth in strate­gic and po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust. As two ma­jor emerg­ing pow­ers and im­por­tant mem­bers of mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums such as Brics and G20, China and South Africa have been play­ing in­creas­ingly im­por­tant roles in pro­mot­ing world peace and de­vel­op­ment and in up­hold­ing the shared in­ter­ests of all de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. China and South Africa en­joy strong eco­nomic com­ple­men­tar­ity. Si­t­u­ated in a prime lo­ca­tion and boast­ing rich re­sources, a sound in­fra­struc­ture, a well-reg­u­lated mar­ket and good le­gal sys­tem, South Africa is the African coun­try that is the most deeply and sub­stan­tively in­volved in link­ing with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. China has the cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy, mar­ket, en­ter­prises, tal­ents and de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence. Both China and South Africa need and com­ple­ment each other for co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. Next year will mark the 20th an­niver­sary of China-South Africa diplo­matic ties. China will take this im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity to work closely to­gether with South Africa to pro­mote co-op­er­a­tion in 10 ar­eas of pri­or­ity namely in­fra­struc­ture, hu­man re­sources, man­u­fac­tur­ing and pro­cess­ing, agri­cul­ture, tourism, marine econ­omy, fi­nance, se­cu­rity, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change and in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion. China is ready to work closely with our South African friends to make our re­la­tions more pro­duc­tive and more ben­e­fi­cial to our two peo­ples in or­der to make our re­la­tions a lo­co­mo­tive in China-Africa re­la­tions.

China will take a more ac­tive part in global gov­er­nance, make greater con­tri­bu­tions in in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance, peace­keep­ing and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity, and join ef­forts with de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to bring about a more demo­cratic in­ter­na­tional or­der and make the in­ter­na­tional gov­er­nance regime more fair, just and rea­son­able. By win-win co-op­er­a­tion, China in­tends to re­main com­mit­ted to the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests, and to closely com­bine China’s de­vel­op­ment with the de­vel­op­ment of the world. China will con­tinue to pro­mote in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion of the Belt and Road ini­tia­tive. To nar­row the gap be­tween the North and the South, China will in­crease more as­sis­tance for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly the least de­vel­oped coun­tries. Open­ing up will re­main China’s ba­sic pol­icy, and China will con­tinue its ef­forts for an open world econ­omy, and make glob­al­i­sa­tion more open, in­clu­sive, bal­anced and win-win. In our vi­sion for a new world, China ex­pressed its strong re­solve to jointly build a world of last­ing peace and univer­sal se­cu­rity. It would re­quire all coun­tries to aban­don the tra­di­tional in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics of zero-sum game and the law of the jun­gle. China will con­tinue to up­hold its fun­da­men­tal for­eign pol­icy goal of pre­serv­ing world peace and pro­mot­ing com­mon de­vel­op­ment. We are con­fi­dent that China’s con­tin­ued pros­per­ity will of­fer to the world, par­tic­u­larly to the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, a new path and op­por­tu­ni­ties to mod­erni­sa­tion and an an­swer to search for a bet­ter so­cial sys­tem.

The China-South Africa com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship main­tains ro­bust mo­men­tum with un­prece­dented height and warmth in strate­gic and po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust. As two ma­jor emerg­ing pow­ers and im­por­tant mem­bers of mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums such as Brics and G20, China and South Africa have been play­ing in­creas­ingly im­por­tant roles in pro­mot­ing world peace and de­vel­op­ment and in uphold­ing the shared in­ter­ests of all de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. China and South Africa en­joy strong eco­nomic com­ple­men­tar­ity. Sit­u­ated in a prime lo­ca­tion and boast­ing rich re­sources, a sound in­fras­truc­ture, a well-reg­u­lated mar­ket and good le­gal sys­tem, South Africa is the African coun­try that is the most deeply and sub­stan­tively in­volved in link­ing with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. China has the cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy, mar­ket, en­ter­prises, ta­lents and de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence. Both China and South Africa need and com­ple­ment each other for co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. Next year will mark the 20th an­niver­sary of China-South Africa di­plo­matic ties. China will take this im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity to work closely to­gether with South Africa to pro­mote co-op­er­a­tion in 10 ar­eas of pri­or­ity namely in­fras­truc­ture, hu­man re­sources, man­u­fac­tur­ing and pro­cess­ing, agri­cul­ture, tourism, marine econ­omy, fi­nance, se­cu­rity, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change and in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion.

za,Sunday Tribune,20100321,China’s bub­ble could burst,"THE TOWN­SHIP of Huaxi in the Yangtze River Delta is a proud sym­bol of how Chi­nese com­mu­nists em­braced cap­i­tal­ism to lift 300 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty in the past three decades. Its leaders took a farm com­mu­nity with bam­boo huts and ox carts in the 1970s and trans­formed it into an in­dus­trial and com­mer­cial pow­er­house, where to­day many of its 30 000 res­i­dents live in man­sions and most have a car. Av­er­age in­come of 80 000 yuan (R85 360) – al­most four times the na­tional av­er­age – al­lows Huaxi to claim it is China’s rich­est vil­lage. Huaxi is also em­blem­atic of the coun­try’s construction and prop­erty boom. Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials there are build­ing one of the world’s 30 tallest build­ings, a 2.5 bil­lion yuan, 328m tower. The re­volv­ing restau­rant atop the “New Vil­lage in the Sky” of­fers views of paddy fields, fish ponds and or­chards. Marc Faber, the pub­lisher of the Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Re­port, says China is over­do­ing it. “It does not make sense for China to build more empty build­ings and add to ca­pac­i­ties in in­dus­tries where you al­ready have over­ca­pac­ity,” Faber said last month. “I think the Chi­nese econ­omy will de­cel­er­ate very sub­stan­tially in 2010 and could even crash.” Huaxi has an even more am­bi­tious project com­ing up: a 6 bil­lion yuan, 538m sky­scraper that would to­day rank as the world’s sec­ond tallest. Such un­der­tak­ings fig­ured in warn­ings hedge fund man­ager Jim Chanos gave in Jan­uary that China was Dubai times a thou­sand. The costs of waste­ful in­vest­ments in empty offices and shop­ping malls and in un­der­used in­fra­struc­ture would weigh on China, said Chanos, the pres­i­dent of Kynikos As­so­ci­ates. “We may find that’s what pops the Chi­nese bub­ble sooner rather than later.” China has de­fied the global re­ces­sion and re­mained the fastest-grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct soared 10.7 per­cent in the fourth quar­ter. The gov­ern­ment has pro­vided 4 tril­lion yuan in stim­u­lus spending and en­cour­aged banks to lend a record 9.59 tril­lion yuan last year, try­ing to bridge the gap un­til de­mand for ex­ports re­bounds or do­mes­tic con­sump­tion takes off. In Jan­uary, banks lent a fur­ther 1.39 tril­lion yuan – al­most one­fifth of the tar­get amount for this year. Also in Jan­uary, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment climbed 7.8 per­cent to $8.13bn (R59.3bn). Re­tail sales over last month’s lu­nar new year hol­i­day rose 17.2 per­cent from the same time last year, said the Min­istry of Com­merce. While China’s re­silience has helped sup­port the world econ­omy, rais­ing de­mand for en­ergy and raw ma­te­ri­als, the burst­ing of a bub­ble would have the op­po­site ef­fect. Gov­ern­ment ef­forts to wean the econ­omy off its ex­traor­di­nary sup­port may roil mar­kets. In Jan­uary, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment or­dered banks to curb lend­ing, which put China’s stock mar­ket into re­verse. In a sign, in part, of how de­pen­dent the world has be­come on China, stocks and cur­ren­cies slumped in places such as Aus­tralia and Brazil that sup­ply com­modi­ties. On Fe­bru­ary 12, China for the sec­ond time in a month or­dered banks to set aside more re­serves. The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite in­dex has fallen marginally this year, af­ter gain­ing 80 per­cent last year. “If the Chi­nese econ­omy de­cel­er­ates or crashes, what you have is a dis­as­trous en­vi­ron­ment for com­modi­ties,” said Faber. Mean­while, Mark Mo­bius is stick­ing with China. The ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Templeton As­set Man­age­ment is en­cour­aged that the gov­ern­ment is pulling back some of its eco­nomic sup­port. “We see the gov­ern­ment’s tight­en­ing of lend­ing as a pos­i­tive be­cause it mod­er­ates the risk to some de­gree,” says Mo­bius. “This is a cor­rec­tion in an on­go­ing bull mar­ket.” – Bloomberg",南非
za,Weekend Argus (Sunday Edition),20101114,Miss World presents unique view of China’s global re­la­tions,"the ten­ta­cles of China’s re­la­tion­ship with the world are trav­el­ling. Two, how much that rap­port has de­te­ri­o­rated since the No­bel an­nounce­ment last month. Since then, China has lob­bied gov­ern­ments to boy­cott the No­bel cer­e­mony in Oslo, ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes in Asia heated up and tem­pers flared over rare-earth ma­te­ri­als ex­ports. Tit-for-tat geopol­i­tics also is creep­ing more into fi­nan­cial mat­ters. A move by China’s Dagong Global Credit Rat­ing Com­pany this week to down­grade the US could be the lat­est case in point. Only Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s staff would have the au­dac­ity to sug­gest the US’s fi­nances are fine. If you gave an ac­coun­tant a ran­dom sam­pling of na­tional bal­ance sheets with­out say­ing which coun­tries they be­longed to, some de­vel­op­ing na­tions might get a higher rat­ing than the US. Yet only pol­i­tics can ex­plain China re­ceiv­ing a higher Dagong credit rat­ing than the is­suer of the world’s re­serve cur­rency. The Fed’s lat­est steps don’t give Dagong of­fi­cials po­lit­i­cal cover. Their move to cut the US’s rat­ing to A+ from AA seems wryly timed to co-in­cide with this week’s Group of 20 (G20) sum­mit in Seoul. Granted, a sim­i­lar prob­lem helped fuel the sub­prime loan cri­sis. Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice and Stan­dard &amp; Poor’s rated garbage as AAA. Their lack of in­de­pen­dence from the en­ti­ties to whom they pro­vided top rat­ings helped bring cap­i­tal­ism to the brink of col­lapse. Dagong had a valid point in July when it stripped the US of its AAA rat­ing. Con­versely, China would seem to be among the least ugly con­tes­tants in the global eco­nomic beauty pageant. This lat­est US rat­ing cut, though, is overkill. Ev­ery­one knows US fi­nances are a mess. Much the same could be said of the euro zone. Ja­pan’s debt chal­lenges are hardly news. Dagong’s num­ber crunch­ers would be bet­ter off min­ing the Chi­nese econ­omy for cracks than point­ing fin­gers over­seas. What the world doesn’t know is where the big risks lurk in an econ­omy that sur­passed Ja­pan as the sec­ond-largest ear­lier this year. Five years ago, China’s non­trans­par­ent model was fine as it busily worked to fuel growth and re­duce poverty. To­day, China is too vi­tal to let po­ten­tial pit­falls fes­ter be­yond in­vestors’ views. The mon­u­men­tal build up of cur­rency re­serves should be re­viewed. By load­ing up on dol­lars, China is dis­tort­ing its money sup­ply and adding to its over­heat­ing risks. In Seoul this week, much of the fo­cus is yuan-re­lated. The odds of G20 of­fi­cials get­ting China to boost its cur­rency are al­most nil. More likely, events will re­in­force the ev­ery-nation-for-it­self dy­namic that has dom­i­nated since Wall Street’s near col­lapse in 2008. That gets us back to Miss World. Economies com­pete a bit like beauty con­tes­tants in the best of times. But the pos­tur­ing has got­ten nas­tier and more des­per­ate over the past two years. Nowhere is that clearer than Asia. The re­gion is com­ing to terms with the idio­syn­cra­sies of a new su­per­power while US in­flu­ence wanes. Those ten­sions are bub­bling up from credit-rat­ing de­ci­sions to beauty con­tests. It’s not what you would call a pretty pic­ture.",南非
za,Sowetan,20201103,Four more Trump years don’t bode well for world econ­omy,"The mis­sion of this col­umn is to med­i­tate and re­flect upon prac­ti­cal is­sues that could re­solve SA ’ s triple chal­lenges of un­em­ploy­ment, in­equal­ity and poverty. In hours, tens of mil­lions of Amer­i­cans will have voted in the most con­se­quen­tial pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in re­cent his­tory. As a South African, I don ’ t have a vote to cast, but I do have a stake in the out­come. For a start, as a busi­ness­man, the na­ture of the out­come of this elec­tion will af­fect the global en­vi­ron­ment in which my in­vest­ments are made. A dis­puted out­come, a spec­tre hang­ing omi­nously over this elec­tion, will cause global uncer­tainty for weeks. As a busi­ness­man, I know only too well how bad uncer­tainty is to the world econ­omy, es­pe­cially one strug­gling to cope with the most dev­as­tat­ing pan­demic. Also, com­ing from a coun­try which bor­rows in Amer­i­can dol­lars I have to care about what hap­pens in the US. For the record, I have never met Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump nor his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den. How­ever, I have felt the im­pact of Trump ’ s di­vi­sive and de­struc­tive pres­i­dency over the past four years. I shud­der to think what the im­pact of another four years will be to the world econ­omy and the rules-based trad­ing sys­tem. The list of Trump ’ s pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tions to the world ’ s com­mu­nity of na­tions is shorter: top on this list is that he has started no new war. He did, how­ever, start a trade war and a cur­rency war with China which have dam­aged the global econ­omy and world trade. Even be­fore Covid-19 struck a dev­as­tat­ing blow to global trade and the world econ­omy, the neg­a­tive im­pact of the Sino-US trade war was ev­i­dent. Worse, his Make-Amer­ica-Great strat­egy in­clud­ing re­trench­ing Amer­ica ’ s global mil­i­tary, eco­nomic and hu­man­i­tar­ian role, has weak­ened the world ’ s long­stand­ing rules-based trad­ing sys­tem. To be fair to Trump, the world ’ s trad­ing sys­tem was not per­fect. It was old and ar­chaic, and had failed to keep up with the chang­ing trad­ing sys­tem. The sys­tem, as rep­re­sented by the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), was de­signed to gov­ern mainly agri­cul­ture and man­u­fac­tur­ing. It was ille­quipped to deal with trade in ser­vices, e-com­merce, global fi­nance and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances. It badly needed mod­erni­sa­tion. In­stead of driv­ing its mod­erni­sa­tion agenda, Trump ’ s ad­min­is­tra­tion broke it with two blows. First, Amer­ica re­fused to sup­port the ap­point­ment of WTO ’ s new ap­peal judges; sec­ond, the WTO is with­out a di­rec­tor-gen­eral af­ter the early de­par­ture of Roberto Azevedo, as Trump is re­ject­ing for­mer Nige­rian fi­nance min­is­ter Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the fron­trun­ner, as the next chief. Af­ter four years in power, Africa has very lit­tle to show from a Trump pres­i­dency. Another four years at the White House might prove cat­a­strophic with a bro­ken world trad­ing sys­tem. Af­ter all, had the US sup­ported the se­lec­tion of new WTO judges the US-China trade dispute would have been re­ferred to it for ad­ju­di­ca­tion, spar­ing the world its dam­ag­ing ef­fects. Lately, Trump has ig­nored the crip­pling coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and he has been tone deaf to the ris­ing racial ten­sions in the US. It is hard to eval­u­ate what Bi­den would do for Amer­i­cans, the world and Africa be­cause the pres­i­den­tial race has been largely fought on the US do­mes­tic agenda. Build­ing on his track record as Barack Obama ’ s deputy for eight years, he has promised to re­build Amer­ica ’ s global stature as a con­struc­tive player, drive an in­clu­sive growth agenda and re­pair Trump ’ s dam­age. The suc­cess of Bi­den ’ s pres­i­dency should be easy to de­fine: if Amer­i­cans gave him four years in of­fice, and all he did was to undo the dam­age Trump caused to the world econ­omy that would be a good start. To­day, Amer­i­cans have a chance to elect a lead­er­ship that will get their coun­try to em­brace the pri­macy of science and truth, and re­build a fairer, car­ing and rules-based world order to speed up a post-pan­demic re­cov­ery.",南非

SUS­PENDED SARS Com­mis­sioner Tom Moy­ane played an in­stru­men­tal role in the ap­point­ment of an IT company with­out fol­low­ing proper ten­der pro­cesses less than three months af­ter his ap­point­ment in Septem­ber, 2014. He also ap­proved pay­ments of mil­lions of rand to Gart­ner SA, de­spite the IT company fail­ing to pro­duce time sheets jus­ti­fy­ing its in­voices.

Tshi­tangano ini­tially tes­ti­fied about the fraud­u­lent award of a R200 mil­lion ten­der to Bain Con­sult­ing Agency to con­duct a failed turn­around strat­egy at Sars. Bain’s strat­egy, the com­mis­sion heard, led to an in­crease in the il­licit flow of money and cig­a­rette syn­di­cates, as well as or­gan­ised crime. Yes­ter­day, Tshi­tangano said that since his ini­tial tes­ti­mony in Au­gust, an al­leged “pro-cor­rup­tion group” and those per­ceived to be close to the “un­eth­i­cal” Moy­ane had since opened a crim­i­nal case against him at Sun­ny­side po­lice sta­tion. He said his ac­cusers told the po­lice that he had mil­lions of rand in his bank ac­counts. Tshi­tangano said Sars had an IT con­tract with EOH Mthombo, but that con­tract was nul­li­fied with­out any ex­pla­na­tion in favour of Gart­ner. Ac­cord­ing to Tshi­tangano, Sars of­fi­cials in­vited Gart­ner to at­tend a meet­ing on De­cem­ber 18, 2014. He said no min­utes or award let­ters of the ten­ders were given to the National Trea­sury. One con­tro­ver­sial ten­der was for IT strat­egy and mod­erni­sa­tion re­view phase one pro­cure­ment. He said that ten­der was for R12.9m, but Sars and Gart­ner had, over the past weeks, failed to pro­vide the National Trea­sury with the min­utes and terms of ref­er­ence of the ten­ders. Tshi­tangano said phase two of the con­tract was for R144.4m – Re­search and Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices ten­der R5.6m; Gart­ner Graph Im­ple­men­ta­tion R9.7m; Star As­sess­ment R8.7m and Re­search for IT ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cal pro­fes­sion­als R16.3m.

They are cry­ing out for for­eign in­vest­ment and fi­nan­cial aid from western coun­tries. “In­vest­ment” from China and Rus­sia in the form of “loans” do not come with­out big strings at­tached. Both coun­tries will want their pound of flesh in re­turn, which has been to the detri­ment of most African coun­tries that ac­cepted their “loans”, the very rea­son why even­tu­ally th­ese African coun­tries have turned to the West for fi­nan­cial sal­va­tion.

Now in its third year, the award is given to in­di­vid­u­als who have made an out­stand­ing con­tri­bu­tion to the de­vel­op­ment of their own coun­try, and the rest of the world. Pre­vi­ously, the award fo­cused on in­di­vid­u­als who worked to strengthen re­la­tions be­tween China and Europe, recog­nis­ing those who worked to­wards fos­ter­ing co-op­er­a­tion, peace and de­vel­op­ment be­tween East and West. In 2019, it was ex­panded to ac­knowl­edge those who strive for friend­ships be­tween coun­tries, cul­tures and re­li­gions. Dr Survé con­grat­u­lated fel­low African, Ibukun Awosika, chair­man of First Bank of Nige­ria Limited, who was also awarded. The two are the first, and only, Africa-based re­cip­i­ents of the award.

I want to thank my fam­ily, my friends, the em­ploy­ees of the Sekunjalo Group and as­so­ci­ated com­pa­nies, and the many com­mu­nity ac­tivists and so­cial jus­tice part­ners, NGOs and coali­tions that have shared this journey with me over the last few years. This is our award and pays homage to the col­lec­tive ef­fort that every­one has made to try and create a bet­ter world. “Whether we do it through the med­i­cal treat­ment of de­tainees, through busi­ness, or the use of our re­sources to create jobs and over­come poverty, whether through the me­dia where we pro­vide nar­ra­tives that show­case a plu­ral­ity of opin­ions… we do what we do, driven by the de­sire and de­ter­mi­na­tion to build a bet­ter world.” He thanked the in­ter­na­tional jury, headed by Pro­fes­sor Pe­dro Nueno, the Span­ish Royal Fam­ily and her Majesty, Queen Le­tizia for the hon­our. Dr Survé is the founder of Survé Phi­lan­thropies, which con­sists of seven sep­a­rate foun­da­tions, and is a pa­tron of the World’s Chil­dren’s Prize pro­gramme, which has ed­u­cated and em­pow­ered more than 44 mil­lion chil­dren.

za,The Star Late Edition,20160908,An in­valu­able gift,"IN SPITE of gi­ant strides made in the field of hu­man de­vel­op­ment in the past five decades, one in five peo­ple – or 785 mil­lion peo­ple – aged 15 and above are il­lit­er­ate. Two-thirds of them are women. About twothirds of il­lit­er­ate peo­ple are found in only nine coun­tries, with 45 per­cent liv­ing in In­dia and China (34 per­cent and 11 per­cent re­spec­tively). Although 98 per­cent of il­lit­er­ate peo­ple are con­cen­trated in South and West Asia, sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, and the Arab states, in the US – the world’s eco­nomic pow­er­house – more than 93 mil­lion peo­ple have ba­sic or be­low ba­sic lit­er­acy skills. To­day is In­ter­na­tional Lit­er­acy Day. In 1966, the UN Ed­u­ca­tional, Sci­en­tific and Cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­claimed this day In­ter­na­tional Lit­er­acy Day to “ac­tively mo­bilise the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity and to pro­mote lit­er­acy as an in­stru­ment to em­power in­di­vid­u­als, com­mu­ni­ties and so­ci­eties”. Unesco de­fines lit­er­acy as “the abil­ity to iden­tify, un­der­stand, in­ter­pret, cre­ate, com­mu­ni­cate and com­pute, us­ing printed and writ­ten ma­te­ri­als as­so­ci­ated with vary­ing con­texts”. In more ad­vanced so­ci­eties, lit­er­acy – the foun­da­tion of all learn­ing – is taken for granted. For those bereft of this skill, life is a per­pet­ual chal­lenge. With­out the abil­ity to read of­ten comes mis­un­der­stand­ing and con­fu­sion which per­pet­u­ates the cy­cle of poverty. Peo­ple who can’t write or read can’t do ba­sic things such as sign­ing a con­tract, or get­ting ba­sic job train­ing. In fact, poverty and bur­den of dis­ease cor­re­late di­rectly with il­lit­er­acy and low lit­er­acy. Stats show that life ex­pectancy is low­est where peo­ple have low lit­er­acy lev­els. While lit­er­acy in South Africa is mea­sured at above 90 per­cent, the govern­ment is run­ning the Kha Ri Gude Mass Lit­er­acy Cam­paign to help adults above the age of 15 years who still re­quire lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills. Lit­er­acy is part of the UN Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. The tar­get is that by 2030 all youth and a sub­stan­tial pro­por­tion of adults world­wide would achieve lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy.

za,The Mercury,20160907,Help for town­ship busi­nesses,"THE provin­cial Depart­ment of Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment is ex­plor­ing ways of un­lock­ing the eco­nomic po­ten­tial in town­ships and help­ing small busi­ness grow, says KwaZu­luNatal Pre­mier Willies Mchunu. Mchunu was speak­ing to The Mer­cury on the side­lines of the KZN Growth Coali­tion busi­ness break­fast in Dur­ban yesterday. Small busi­ness own­ers in town­ships have com­plained that they are be­ing squeezed out of the econ­omy by busi­nesses run by for­eign­ers. Re­cently, tuck shop own­ers in Ch­ester­ville’s Ja­maica area com­plained that for­eign­ers there were putting them out of busi­ness. They warned them to stop trad­ing or there would be con­se­quences. Mchunu took is­sue with fel­low Africans be­ing la­belled for­eign­ers in South Africa, say­ing the gov­ern­ment would not tol­er­ate acts by in­di­vid­u­als who sought to separate peo­ple and desta­bilise the prov­ince. The provin­cial gov­ern­ment had in­ter­vened in Ch­ester­ville and was in­volved in ne­go­ti­a­tions to set­tle the mat­ter. “The Depart­ment of Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment is busy with a study look­ing at how to de­velop town­ship economies. We are look­ing at what is there, what skills are there and we will take it from there,” Mchunu said. He warned the busi­ness del­e­gates at the event against xeno­pho­bic be­hav­iour. “I want to con­demn any at­tacks on for­eign na­tion­als. In an econ­omy with a high un­em­ploy­ment rate, mi­grants are of­ten ac­cused of steal­ing jobs for South Africans,” Mchunu said. He said the prov­ince’s econ­omy was show­ing signs of life and in­di­ca­tions were that the ben­e­fits were trick­ling down to res­i­dents. De­spite ear­lier neg­a­tive pro­jec­tions for the coun­try, KwaZulu-Natal’s econ­omy was ex­pected to grow at 2.4%. “I re­ceived a com­mu­nity sur­vey re­port from the Statis­ti­cian-Gen­eral, Pali Le­hohla.

FI­NANCE Min­is­ter Malusi Gi­gaba cor­rectly pointed out in his re­cent medium-term bud­get speech that growth is the key to fix­ing South Africa’s ills. Growth is what raises the av­er­age in­come per per­son, cre­ates jobs and in­creases tax rev­enues. The com­pound ef­fect of high eco­nomic growth can rapidly trans­form a coun­try and the wel­fare of its peo­ple. China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth rate av­er­aged 9.69 per­cent from 1989 to 2016, mean­ing that the econ­omy is 13.3 times big­ger now than it was 28 years ago. Sin­ga­pore av­er­aged 8 per­cent real growth from 1960 to 1999, a 40-year pe­riod that saw its econ­omy grow 21.7 times. Of late, we are get­ting poorer on a per capita ba­sis as our eco­nomic growth rate lags our pop­u­la­tion growth rate. As­sum­ing the govern­ment were se­ri­ous about eco­nomic growth, what are the lessons that we can learn from around the world? Free en­ter­prise and cap­i­tal­ism are key to sus­tain­able growth. Gen­er­ally speak­ing the freer the sys­tem the faster the growth. While China and Viet­nam are one party states and both still have size­able state con­trolled com­pa­nies, their growth has been driven by their pri­vate sec­tors. For the most part their pri­vate sec­tors are lightly reg­u­lated, and com­pe­ti­tion is fierce and bare knuck­led – pos­si­bly the purest form of cap­i­tal­ism in the world today. Lightly reg­u­lated labour mar­kets and low min­i­mum wages are part of the se­cret sauce of the com­pet­i­tive­ness of coun­tries like China and Viet­nam. Al­low­ing “ex­ploita­tion” played a key role in lift­ing a bil­lion Chi­nese out of poverty within a gen­er­a­tion. It is far bet­ter for both the in­di­vid­u­als and the coun­try to have jobs with low in­comes than no in­comes at all. Sta­bil­ity is more im­por­tant than democ­racy for growth. It is note­wor­thy that sev­eral of the high­est growth economies have been one party or au­thor­i­tar­ian cap­i­tal­ist sys­tems, no­tably Sin­ga­pore, China, Viet­nam and Dubai. A state must en­joy the con­fi­dence of its peo­ple and busi­ness sec­tor for there to be a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for growth. Rule of law Good gov­er­nance and the rule of law pro­vides cit­i­zens, busi­ness own­ers and in­vestors the con­fi­dence that their in­ter­ests will be pro­tected and in­creases their will­ing­ness to take risk. More projects are vi­able as the cost of cap­i­tal is lower and busi­ness can project re­turns fur­ther into the fu­ture. In­fra­struc­ture is a key driver of pro­duc­tiv­ity and eco­nomic growth. Eco­nomic growth is achieved through in­creas­ing effi- ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity. If peo­ple and goods can move around faster and at lower cost, this re­sults in an in­crease in pro­duc­tiv­ity and hence growth. Many busi­nesses only be­come vi­able once they have ac­cess to good in­fra­struc­ture. In­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment has been key to their stel­lar growth en­joyed by China and Dubai. Hu­man cap­i­tal is a key dif­fer­en­tia­tor. Hu­man cap­i­tal is a com­pos­ite of ed­u­ca­tion, ex­pe­ri­ence and cul­tural val­ues like work ethic, re­li­a­bil­ity, re­source­ful­ness and en­trepreneuri­al­ism. High growth coun­tries have suc­ceeded in in­creas­ing hu­man cap­i­tal through ex­celling in ed­u­ca­tion and in­still­ing cul­tural val­ues – the best ex­am­ple is Sin­ga­pore, while Her­man Mashaba, Johannesburg’s mayor, shows po­ten­tial as an in­spir­ing leader. A high sav­ings rate funds a high in­vest­ment rate and a rapidly grow­ing econ­omy. High growth coun­tries are usu­ally high sav­ings coun­tries. It is far more sus­tain­able for a coun­try to fund its own growth rather than re­ly­ing pri­mar­ily on ex­ter­nal cap­i­tal which can eas­ily take flight. Open out­ward fac­ing economies which em­brace tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion. All de­vel­op­ing mar­kets today have the advan- tage that they can as­sim­i­late new tech­nolo­gies like mo­bile phones and the in­ter­net to boost their pro­duc­tiv­ity and hence their growth. Low to moder­ate taxes are a fea­ture of high growth economies. Lower taxes make it eas­ier for projects to meet the re­quired re­turn on in­vest­ment and in­cen­tivise hard work. Money re­tained by the pri­vate sec­tor gen­er­ally earns a far higher re­turn than money paid to the state. Economies work best when the state sec­tor is small and ef­fi­cient. So­phis­ti­cated fi­nan­cial mar­kets play a key role in ef­fi­ciently chan­nelling and al­lo­cat­ing re­sources be­tween savers, in­vestors and bor­row­ers. Key to growth Tourism is key to growth and cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment. While tourists are keen to ex­pe­ri­ence in­creas­ingly novel lo­ca­tions, they are also very risk averse as far as per­sonal safety is con­cerned. Tourism presents an ob­vi­ous way to cre­ate large num­bers of ser­vice jobs, for­eign ex­change earn­ings and growth. So how does South Africa match up against the fac­tors listed above?

Two-thirds of them are women. About twothirds of il­lit­er­ate peo­ple are found in only nine coun­tries, with 45 per­cent liv­ing in In­dia and China (34 per­cent and 11 per­cent re­spec­tively). Although 98 per­cent of il­lit­er­ate peo­ple are con­cen­trated in South and West Asia, sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, and the Arab states, in the US – the world’s eco­nomic pow­er­house – more than 93 mil­lion peo­ple have ba­sic or be­low ba­sic lit­er­acy skills. To­day is In­ter­na­tional Lit­er­acy Day. In 1966, the UN Ed­u­ca­tional, Sci­en­tific and Cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­claimed this day In­ter­na­tional Lit­er­acy Day to “ac­tively mo­bilise the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity and to pro­mote lit­er­acy as an in­stru­ment to em­power in­di­vid­u­als, com­mu­ni­ties and so­ci­eties”. Un­esco de­fines lit­er­acy as “the abil­ity to iden­tify, un­der­stand, in­ter­pret, cre­ate, com­mu­ni­cate and com­pute, us­ing printed and writ­ten ma­te­ri­als as­so­ci­ated with vary­ing con­texts”. In more ad­vanced so­ci­eties, lit­er­acy – the foun­da­tion of all learn­ing – is taken for granted. For those bereft of this skill, life is a per­pet­ual chal­lenge. Without the abil­ity to read of­ten comes misun­der­stand­ing and con­fu­sion which per­pet­u­ates the cy­cle of poverty. Peo­ple who can’t write or read can’t do ba­sic things such as sign­ing a con­tract, or get­ting ba­sic job train­ing. In fact, poverty and bur­den of dis­ease cor­re­late di­rectly with il­lit­er­acy and low lit­er­acy. Stats show that life ex­pectancy is low­est where peo­ple have low lit­er­acy lev­els. While lit­er­acy in South Africa is mea­sured at above 90 per­cent, the gov­ern­ment is run­ning the Kha Ri Gude Mass Lit­er­acy Cam­paign to help adults above the age of 15 years who still re­quire lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills. Lit­er­acy is part of the UN Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. The tar­get is that by 2030 all youth and a sub­stan­tial pro­por­tion of adults world­wide would achieve lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy.

For the most part their pri­vate sec­tors are lightly reg­u­lated, and com­pe­ti­tion is fierce and bare knuck­led – pos­si­bly the purest form of cap­i­tal­ism in the world today. Lightly reg­u­lated labour mar­kets and low min­i­mum wages are part of the se­cret “Ex­ploita­tion” lifted a bil­lion Chi­nese out of poverty. It is far bet­ter for in­di­vid­u­als and the coun­try to have low-in­come jobs than no in­comes at all. sauce of the com­pet­i­tive­ness of coun­tries like China and Viet­nam. Al­low­ing “ex­ploita­tion” played a key role in lift­ing a bil­lion Chi­nese out of poverty within a gen­er­a­tion. It is far bet­ter for both the in­di­vid­u­als and the coun­try to have jobs with low in­comes than no in­comes at all. Sta­bil­ity is more im­por­tant than democ­racy for growth. It is note­wor­thy that sev­eral of the high­est growth economies have been one party or au­thor­i­tar­ian cap­i­tal­ist sys­tems, no­tably Sin­ga­pore, China, Viet­nam and Dubai. A state must en­joy the con­fi­dence of its peo­ple and busi­ness sec­tor for there to be a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for growth. Rule of law Good gov­er­nance and the rule of law pro­vides cit­i­zens, busi­ness own­ers and in­vestors the con­fi­dence that their in­ter­ests will be pro­tected and in­creases their will­ing­ness to take risk. More projects are vi­able as the cost of cap­i­tal is lower and busi­ness can project re­turns fur­ther into the fu­ture. In­fra­struc­ture is a key driver of pro­duc­tiv­ity and eco­nomic growth. Eco­nomic growth is achieved through in­creas­ing effi- ciency and pro­duc­tiv­ity. If peo­ple and goods can move around faster and at lower cost, this re­sults in an in­crease in pro­duc­tiv­ity and hence growth. Many busi­nesses only be­come vi­able once they have ac­cess to good in­fra­struc­ture. In­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment has been key to their stel­lar growth en­joyed by China and Dubai. Hu­man cap­i­tal is a key dif­fer­en­tia­tor. Hu­man cap­i­tal is a com­pos­ite of ed­u­ca­tion, ex­pe­ri­ence and cul­tural val­ues like work ethic, re­li­a­bil­ity, re­source­ful­ness and en­trepreneuri­al­ism. High growth coun­tries have suc­ceeded in in­creas­ing hu­man cap­i­tal through ex­celling in ed­u­ca­tion and in­still­ing cul­tural val­ues – the best ex­am­ple is Sin­ga­pore, while Her­man Mashaba, Johannesburg’s mayor, shows po­ten­tial as an in­spir­ing leader. A high sav­ings rate funds a high in­vest­ment rate and a rapidly grow­ing econ­omy. High growth coun­tries are usu­ally high sav­ings coun­tries. It is far more sus­tain­able for a coun­try to fund its own growth rather than re­ly­ing pri­mar­ily on ex­ter­nal cap­i­tal which can eas­ily take flight. Open out­ward fac­ing economies which em­brace tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion. All de­vel­op­ing mar­kets today have the advan- tage that they can as­sim­i­late new tech­nolo­gies like mo­bile phones and the in­ter­net to boost their pro­duc­tiv­ity and hence their growth. Low to moder­ate taxes are a fea­ture of high growth economies. Lower taxes make it eas­ier for projects to meet the re­quired re­turn on in­vest­ment and in­cen­tivise hard work. Money re­tained by the pri­vate sec­tor gen­er­ally earns a far higher re­turn than money paid to the state. Economies work best when the state sec­tor is small and ef­fi­cient. So­phis­ti­cated fi­nan­cial mar­kets play a key role in ef­fi­ciently chan­nelling and al­lo­cat­ing re­sources be­tween savers, in­vestors and bor­row­ers. Key to growth Tourism is key to growth and cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment. While tourists are keen to ex­pe­ri­ence in­creas­ingly novel lo­ca­tions, they are also very risk averse as far as per­sonal safety is con­cerned. Tourism presents an ob­vi­ous way to cre­ate large num­bers of ser­vice jobs, for­eign ex­change earn­ings and growth. So how does South Africa match up against the fac­tors listed above? In some as­pects well. Our fi­nan­cial mar­kets, banks and ac­count­ing stan­dards are world class. We have sev­eral world class com­pa­nies. Our in­sti­tu­tions and rule of law are still viewed as strong by emerg­ing mar­ket stan­dards. Cape Town’s beauty and at­trac­tions are world renowned, as are our game parks. Our short­com­ings are well known, and they stand in the way of South Africa achiev­ing its po­ten­tial. That looks un­likely to change un­til con­fi­dence in our govern­ment is re­stored, a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for the pri­vate sec­tor is cre­ated and we, as a coun­try, are out­wardly fo­cused and striv­ing to com­pete. Build­ing our hu­man cap­i­tal is ur­gent – and free qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion for all (in­clud­ing ter­tiary) is cer­tainly achiev­able if waste and theft were cut from govern­ment pro­cure­ment and govern­ment salaries were on a par with pri­vate sec­tor salaries (they are of­ten far higher). Surely that would be far truer em­pow­er­ment than the ex­ist­ing BEE pro­grammes. On the cur­rent trend the prog­no­sis for South Africa is dire. As Gi­gaba said, our sal­va­tion lies in rapid eco­nomic growth – and soon.",南非

za,Sunday Tribune,20150118,Tech­nol­ogy can help mil­lions tran­scend poverty,"IN HIS book Zero to One, Sil­i­con Val­ley en­tre­pre­neur Peter Thiel ad­dresses the dis­tinc­tion be­tween glob­al­i­sa­tion and tech­nol­ogy. Glob­al­i­sa­tion con­sti­tutes “hor­i­zon­tal progress”, he writes, or “tak­ing things that work some­where and mak­ing them work ev­ery­where”; and China is the “paradig­matic ex­am­ple” of growth through glob­al­i­sa­tion. Tech­nol­ogy, on the other hand, en­ables “ver­ti­cal progress”, which Thiel ar­gues is harder to imag­ine be­cause it means “do­ing some­thing no­body has ever done”. More­over, while tech­nol­ogy has for many come to mean in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, there’s no rea­son to re­strict its def­i­ni­tion in this way, since “any new and bet­ter way of do­ing things” can be called tech­nol­ogy. Since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, there has been an ex­plo­sion of en­trepreneur­ship around the world. Asian coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly In­dia and China, have demon­strated their abil­ity to cre­ate high-growth start-ups. Around the world, there are 70 or so pri­vate en­ter­prises val­ued at above $1 bil­lion (R11.5bn), and Asia is home to 15 of them. But most of th­ese ven­tures are prod­ucts of hor­i­zon­tal progress (go­ing “from one to n”, to use Thiel’s ex­pres­sion) and not ver­ti­cal progress (“from zero to one”). Strictly speak­ing, even in­ter­net gi­ants such as China’s Alibaba Group and In­dia’s Flip­kart are not tech­nol­ogy pi­o­neers: their well-earned suc­cess has been in de­ploy­ing and scal­ing a proven business model in their home mar­ket. So far, China, In­dia and other emerg­ing mar­kets have grown by adopt­ing and adapt­ing tech­nolo­gies and business mod­els from ad­vanced economies. But can eco­nomic growth be sus­tained and de­liv­ered through the glob­al­i­sa­tion model alone? Large pop­u­la­tions in Asia and Africa as­pire to join the ranks of the mid­dle class; bring­ing sus­tain­abil­ity to so many peo­ple will take in­no­va­tion across a wide range of in­dus­tries, which have so far re­mained rel­a­tively un­touched by the rapid pace of change af­fect­ing in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nolo­gies (ICT). There is an enor­mous amount of la­tent con­sumer de­mand across the de­vel­op­ing world that will be dif­fi­cult to meet with­out in­no­va­tion. Con­sider the chal­lenges in en­ergy, health care and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, for ex­am­ple. En­ergy and power re­quire­ments are so enor­mous that meet­ing them with fos­sil fuel-based tech­nolo­gies would re­sult in se­ri­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, as China’s ex­pe­ri­ence is prov­ing. In health care, large sec­tions of the poor are be­ing priced out of the mar­ket for life- sav­ing drugs, and the in­dus­try re­quires a more cost-ef­fec­tive drug-de­vel­op­ment model, as well as new gov­ern­ment wel­fare mech­a­nisms to de­liver medicines to the bot­tom of the pyra­mid, with­out violating in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights of drug in­no­va­tors. In fi­nance, tens of mil­lions of peo­ple re­main with­out bank ac­counts and are cut off from the for­mal fi­nan­cial sys­tem. Rapidly evolv­ing crypto-cur­rency tech­nolo­gies such as the Bit­coin (com­bined with in­ter­net-en­abled smart­phones) can help widen fi­nan­cial ac­cess. The scale of need across th­ese and other in­dus­tries is such that the glob­al­i­sa­tion ap­proach alone is not suf­fi­cient: new tech­nol­ogy is ur­gently re­quired. En­trepreneurs have to de­liver in­no­va­tions in mul­ti­ple sec­tors, not just ICT-re­lated in­dus­tries, to be able to make a large-scale im­pact. Fi­nally, it is more dif­fi­cult for en­trepreneurs and in­vestors in ad­vanced economies to de­liver such in­no­va­tions be­cause they are not close to the cus­tomer.

Mchunu was speak­ing dur­ing a sod-turn­ing cer­e­mony mark­ing the be­gin­ning of the con­struc­tion of a CS Smelter Park in Ladysmith yes­ter­day. He was joined at the event by Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment, Tourism and En­vi­ron­men­tal Af­fairs MEC, Sihle Zikalala, man­age­ment of CS Smelter Park and in­vestors from China. The CS Smelter Park will have a pri­vately owned coal­fired power sta­tion that will be de­vel­oped in three phases of 300 megawatts each. Mchunu said: “As the pro­vin­cial gov­ern­ment we are ex­cited that Phase 1 of this project will at­tract for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment of about R39.1 bil­lion.” “What is even more en­cour­ag­ing is that there is an es­ti­mated R30bn an­nual con­tri­bu­tion to­wards the prov­ince’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. “This will en­sure we re­main the sec­ond con­trib­u­tor to­wards the na­tional gross do­mes­tic prod­uct be­hind Gaut­eng,” he said.

za,Pretoria News,20151204,What’s on China’s Agenda 2063?,"THE FO­RUM on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) has be­come the quin­tes­sen­tial touch­stone of pro­mot­ing a broad spec­trum of co-op­er­a­tive re­la­tions be­tween the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China and Africa. Since its es­tab­lish­ment in 2000 and on the ba­sis of its tri­en­nial sum­mits, FOCAC has re­shaped the co-op­er­a­tion op­tions avail­able to African coun­tries. More­over, FOCAC has demon­strated China’s re­solve to de­liver tan­gi­ble and wel­fare-en­hanc­ing ben­e­fits as one of the con­ti­nent’s premier trade and de­vel­op­ment part­ners. In re­turn, China seeks se­cure and sus­tained ac­cess to African coun­tries’ nat­u­ral re­sources; it wants to make trade and com­mer­cial in­roads into a mar­ket of more than 1 bil­lion peo­ple that is grow­ing and chang­ing rapidly in its con­sumer cul­ture; and it has been un­equiv­o­cal about pro­mot­ing its own le­git­i­macy and sta­tus through sup­port of the “One China” pol­icy. The mat­u­ra­tion of China-Africa re­la­tions un­der the aus­pices of FOCAC co­in­cides with the craft­ing of Agenda 2063 by the AU as a vi­sion of trans­for­ma­tion for achiev­ing a pros­per­ous and peace­ful Africa. In cel­e­bra­tion of the 50th an­niver­sary of the es­tab­lish­ment of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity, Agenda 2063 rep­re­sents a col­lec­tive char­ter to move the con­ti­nent in­ex­orably to­wards peo­ple-cen­tred growth and de­vel­op­ment over the next five decades. This char­ter not only pro­vides a vi­sion but also the nor­ma­tive and strate­gic logic to trans­form Africa based on a pro­gram­matic and op­er­a­tional agenda of five 10-year plans that give life to the as­pi­ra­tions em­bed­ded in Agenda 2063. Th­ese as­pi­ra­tions in­clude pro­mot­ing con­ti­nen­tal in­te­gra­tion; en­sur­ing that democ­racy, hu­man rights, and good gov­er­nance pre­vail; em­pha­sis­ing the cen­tral role of women and youth in de­vel­op­ment; and re­defin­ing Africa’s in­ter­na­tional role as a strong and in­flu­en­tial player. At its core, Agenda 2063 seeks to strengthen the mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing im­pulses of eco­nomic growth and struc­tural change which have thus far been weakly ar­tic­u­lated in pol­icy and prac­tice. This is crit­i­cal if African coun­tries are to ad­dress the post-colo­nial lega­cies of ris­ing poverty, un­em­ploy­ment, and in­equal­ity, all of which are com­pounded by dis­ease pan­demics, mil­i­tarised and gen­der violence, politi­cised eth­nic­ity, re­li­gious ex­trem­ism, de­struc­tive con­flicts and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion. It is against this back­ground that the FOCAC and Agenda 2063 pro­cesses can find com­mon cause. Where FOCAC has been sin­gu­larly suc­cess­ful is in what we can call the “first gen­er­a­tion fron­tier” of de­vel­op­ing ro­bust bi­lat­eral chemistries with African coun­tries with which China en­joys of­fi­cial re­la­tions. This helps to ex­plain why on a coun­try ba­sis, China has now be­come South Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner. With bi­lat­eral dy­nam­ics now strongly con­sol­i­dated thanks to FOCAC, the fu­ture of China-Africa re­la­tions must take ac­count of the “sec­ond gen­er­a­tion fron­tier” of en­hanc­ing and sup­port­ing the im­per­a­tive of re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal in­te­gra­tion which is the es­sen­tial leit­mo­tif of Agenda 2063. The AU has al­ready de­vel­oped a num­ber of Pan-African ini­tia­tives that tar­get strate­gic sec­tors of de­vel­op­ment and which will be key to the suc­cess of Agenda 2063. Th­ese in­clude the Com­pre­hen­sive African Agri­cul­tural De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (CAADP); Boost­ing In­tra-Africa Trade (BIAT); the Pro­gramme for In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment in Africa (PIDA); and the Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Agree­ment (CFTA). With the AU Com­mis­sion rep­re­sented on the FOCAC plat­form, it will be im­por­tant for it to forge syn­er­gies with FOCAC and the Chi­nese lead­er­ship as an in­cen­tive for China to be­come a strate­gic player in help­ing to re­alise the am­bi­tion of th­ese re­gional and con­ti­nent-wide ini­tia­tives. This is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant if African coun­tries are to guard against a his­tor­i­cal plan­ning and pol­icy para­dox where the more frame­works have been adopted, the more their out­comes and ef­fi­cacy were dic­tated by the law of di­min­ish­ing re­turns. How­ever, it is in the area of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion through trade that FOCAC can make a last­ing con­tri­bu­tion to the prospects of Agenda 2063 and to Africa’s struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion. As the con­ti­nent’s largest trad­ing part­ner, China’s role will con­tinue to be of great strate­gic sig­nif­i­cance in eco­nomic growth, with equal po­ten­tial to pro­mote trade-in­duced in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion in or­der to ad­dress the chal­lenge of high lev­els of poverty, un­em­ploy­ment, and grow­ing in­equal­ity. China’s greater in­volve­ment in val­ueadded in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion would also be salu­tary for deal­ing with the crit­i­cism that Beijing repli­cates neo-colo­nial trade pat- terns that treat Africa as a com­modi­tised pe­riph­ery. Africa re­mains marginalised in world trade: its share of global ex­ports has ac­tu­ally de­creased from 5.9 per­cent in 1980 to 3.3 per­cent in 2013. Com­pare this to East Asia whose share of global ex­ports in­creased from 2.2 per­cent in 1970 to 17.8 per­cent in 2010. China has demon­strated the value of tak­ing ad­van­tage of re­gional and global trade and pro­duc­tion net­works to drive its own in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion pro­cesses. Africa thus con­fronts three crit­i­cal chal­lenges in this re­gard: the pro­duc­tion and trade in in­ter­me­di­ate goods; es­tab­lish­ing, join­ing and up­grad­ing value chains along na­tional, re­gional and global con­tin­u­ums; and pro­mot­ing ser­vices as a crit­i­cal un­der­pin­ning of trade. Africa’s for­ward in­te­gra­tion in global value chains con­tin­ues to be driven by the ex­port of raw ma­te­ri­als. This has direct im­pact on fur­ther subverting the prom­ise of re­gional value chains where 88 per­cent of in­puts still orig­i­nate out­side the con­ti­nent. This is why BIAT places a pre­mium on in­creased in­tra-African trade and the pro­mo­tion of re­gional value chains as stim­uli of learn­ing, economies of scale, and en­try points into global value chains. FOCAC can cer­tainly play an en­hanced role in fos­ter­ing in­tra-re­gional trade as a means of im­prov­ing back­ward in­te­gra­tion since trade in pro­cessed goods at this level of­fers great op­por­tu­ni­ties for African com­pa­nies to move up value chains. China’s other com­par­a­tive ad­van­tages in in­fra­struc­ture, en­ergy, hu­man cap­i­tal, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and ICTs can also be har­nessed to pro­mote African coun­tries’ ef­fec­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion in value chain­driven in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment. All this ac­tiv­ity could be greatly fa­cil­i­tated with the es­tab­lish­ment of the CFTA for boost­ing in­tra-African trade and its in­dus­trial com­po­nents. The nexus be­tween trade and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion holds im­mense prom­ise for tak­ing a bolder and more in­no­va­tive ap­proach to Africa’s in­te­gra­tion and global com­pet­i­tive­ness. As a “sec­ond gen­er­a­tion” chal­lenge, the FOCAC process could make an en­dur­ing con­tri­bu­tion to re­al­is­ing one of the fun­da­men­tal ob­jec­tives of Agenda 2063.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20090309,"Man­tashe, Turok give ANC pol­icy di­verse shades of red","TWO prom­i­nent men in the ANC rep­re­sent the broad church – and at the same time the pol­icy tur­moil – that is our gov­ern­ing party. Oddly they are both com­mu­nists. Gwede Man­tashe, the ANC sec­re­tary- gen­eral and SA Com­mu­nist Party (SACP) chair­man, spoke at the Pro­gres­sive Busi­ness Fo­rum, an ANC fi­nanc­ing arm, in Cape Town last week. Ben Turok, ANC MP and trade and in­dus­try port­fo­lio com­mit­tee mem­ber, has just pub­lished a book: From The Free­dom Char­ter to Polok­wane: The Evo­lu­tion of ANC Eco­nomic Pol­icy. Al­though Turok was forced out of the SACP long ago for some ab­surd trans­gres­sion that only the foggy world of ide­o­logues un­der­stands, he is a com­pass of eco­nomic red­ness. While he presents the wrong so­lu­tions, I be­lieve his heart is in the right place. That place is with the peo­ple, who in this coun­try are gen­er­ally poor, likely to be un­em­ployed, and over­whelm­ingly black. A Zapiro car­toon graces the front cover. A black woman with a baby on her back is at a pond near a shack, fran­ti­cally wash­ing clothes. A black man wear­ing patched pants sits on a box read­ing a news­pa­per head­lined: “Bud­get To­day.” He quips: “You’ll be glad to know that ac­cord­ing to the an­a­lysts the eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals are in place.” She throws him a black look. Man­tashe came un­der fire from a busi­ness­woman who de­clared her­self a life­long, but an­gry, ANC mem­ber. She railed against al­low­ing China to “dump” cheap and in­fe­rior goods in South Africa, caus­ing thou­sands of job losses, par­tic­u­larly in the cloth­ing sec­tor. Man­tashe did not wince. He ar­gued it would be com­mit­ting trade sui­cide to shut the bor­ders. What if China, which buys iron ore from South Africa, finds the ma­te­ri­als some­where else? Turok ques­tions Gear, trade pol­icy and the ab­sence of a co­her­ent in­dus­trial pol­icy. Analysing the strug­gles to forge a trade pol­icy, he notes that our trade has been char­ac­terised by “an ex­tremely poor ex­port per­for­mance” across the range of man­u­fac­tured, tech­nol­ogy-in­ten­sive and con­sumer goods. He notes that trade pol­icy was es­tab­lished within a frame­work that was set out in the Uruguay round of trade ne­go­ti­a­tions. Lo­cal con­tent and tradere­lated sub­si­dies were cir­cum­scribed. His ar­gu­ment is com­plex, but his so­lu­tion is that trade and in­dus­trial poli­cies should be linked to broader macroe­co­nomic pol­icy. Sta­bil­i­sa­tion poli­cies have achieved the prin­ci­ple ob­jec­tives of con­trol­ling ma­jor fi­nan­cial vari­ables such as do­mes­tic debt, inflation and in­ter­est rates “but a heavy price was paid in the per­sis­tence of in­equal­ity, un­em­ploy­ment, poverty and the huge cost of con­se­quent so­cial prob­lems”, he says. His chap­ter on black empowerment and cap­i­tal­ist crony­ism is a must read. Turok is cor­rect to some ex­tent: pru­dent macroe­co­nomic poli­cies have not brought the an­tic­i­pated in­vest­ment – or even jobs. But greater pro­tec­tion­ism, run­ning higher bud­get deficits and higher inflation lev­els, and re­duc­ing in­ter­est rates may have been even less suc­cess­ful in fight­ing poverty and un­em­ploy­ment. It may be a re­lief that Turok is not in charge of pol­icy im­ple­men­ta­tion, but the de­bate would be less rich without him.",南非

In a lengthy re­port, China’s Na­tional Au­dit Of­fice gave ex­am­ples of is­sues it had dis­cov­ered, but it did not give the to­tal sum of mis­spent funds. How­ever, it said more than 1 100 people were found to have been in­volved in crim­i­nal be­hav­iour. A to­tal of 38 cen­tral govern­ment de­part­ments and 389 bod­ies un­der them were au­dited, amount­ing to some 154 bil­lion yuan (R261bn) of spend­ing, or about a third of last year’s budget. Al­though spend­ing on meet­ings, travel and of­fi­cial trans­port dropped 23 per­cent from the pre­vi­ous year fol­low­ing a high-pro­file cam­paign to tackle graft and waste, not ev­ery­one got the mes­sage, the au­di­tor said. The Trans­port Min­istry was sin­gled out for hold­ing 87 meet­ings last year at five-star ho­tels, while a ge­o­log­i­cal re­search in­sti­tute team spent three days in US gam­bling hub Las Ve­gas while sup­pos­edly on a sci­en­tific trip.

za,The Sunday Independent,20150118,Tech­nol­ogy can help mil­lions tran­scend poverty,"IN HIS book Zero to One, Sil­i­con Val­ley en­tre­pre­neur Peter Thiel ad­dresses the dis­tinc­tion be­tween glob­al­i­sa­tion and tech­nol­ogy. Glob­al­i­sa­tion con­sti­tutes “hor­i­zon­tal progress”, he writes, or “tak­ing things that work some­where and mak­ing them work ev­ery­where”; and China is the “paradig­matic ex­am­ple” of growth through glob­al­i­sa­tion. Tech­nol­ogy, on the other hand, en­ables “ver­ti­cal progress”, which Thiel ar­gues is harder to imag­ine be­cause it means “do­ing some­thing no­body has ever done”. More­over, while tech­nol­ogy has for many come to mean in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, there’s no rea­son to re­strict its def­i­ni­tion in this way, since “any new and bet­ter way of do­ing things” can be called tech­nol­ogy. Since the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, there has been an ex­plo­sion of en­trepreneur­ship around the world. Asian coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly In­dia and China, have demon­strated their abil­ity to cre­ate high-growth start-ups. Around the world, there are 70 or so pri­vate en­ter­prises val­ued at above $1 bil­lion (R11.5bn), and Asia is home to 15 of them. But most of th­ese ven­tures are prod­ucts of hor­i­zon­tal progress (go­ing “from one to n”, to use Thiel’s ex­pres­sion) and not ver­ti­cal progress (“from zero to one”). Strictly speak­ing, even in­ter­net gi­ants such as China’s Alibaba Group and In­dia’s Flip­kart are not tech­nol­ogy pi­o­neers: their well-earned suc­cess has been in de­ploy­ing and scal­ing a proven business model in their home mar­ket. So far, China, In­dia and other emerg­ing mar­kets have grown by adopt­ing and adapt­ing tech­nolo­gies and business mod­els from ad­vanced economies. But can eco­nomic growth be sus­tained and de­liv­ered through the glob­al­i­sa­tion model alone? Large pop­u­la­tions in Asia and Africa as­pire to join the ranks of the mid­dle class; bring­ing sus­tain­abil­ity to so many peo­ple will take in­no­va­tion across a wide range of in­dus­tries, which have so far re­mained rel­a­tively un­touched by the rapid pace of change af­fect­ing in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nolo­gies (ICT). There is an enor­mous amount of la­tent con­sumer de­mand across the de­vel­op­ing world that will be dif­fi­cult to meet with­out in­no­va­tion. Con­sider the chal­lenges in en­ergy, health care and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, for ex­am­ple. En­ergy and power re­quire­ments are so enor­mous that meet­ing them with fos­sil fuel-based tech­nolo­gies would re­sult in se­ri­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, as China’s ex­pe­ri­ence is prov­ing. In health care, large sec­tions of the poor are be­ing priced out of the mar­ket for life- sav­ing drugs, and the in­dus­try re­quires a more cost-ef­fec­tive drug-de­vel­op­ment model, as well as new gov­ern­ment wel­fare mech­a­nisms to de­liver medicines to the bot­tom of the pyra­mid, with­out violating in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights of drug in­no­va­tors. In fi­nance, tens of mil­lions of peo­ple re­main with­out bank ac­counts and are cut off from the for­mal fi­nan­cial sys­tem. Rapidly evolv­ing crypto-cur­rency tech­nolo­gies such as the Bit­coin (com­bined with in­ter­net-en­abled smart­phones) can help widen fi­nan­cial ac­cess. The scale of need across th­ese and other in­dus­tries is such that the glob­al­i­sa­tion ap­proach alone is not suf­fi­cient: new tech­nol­ogy is ur­gently re­quired. En­trepreneurs have to de­liver in­no­va­tions in mul­ti­ple sec­tors, not just ICT-re­lated in­dus­tries, to be able to make a large-scale im­pact. Fi­nally, it is more dif­fi­cult for en­trepreneurs and in­vestors in ad­vanced economies to de­liver such in­no­va­tions be­cause they are not close to the cus­tomer. In­creas­ingly, en­trepreneurs in emerg­ing mar­kets will need to take the ini­tia­tive and at­tempt to do what no­body has done, be­cause the prob­lems in th­ese mar­kets will be prob­lems that no­body has re­ally solved be­fore. Ad­di­tion­ally, th­ese will be prob­lems that ad­vanced economies don’t re­ally have a stake in solv­ing. In other words, emerg­ing-mar­ket en­trepreneurs will need to think of how to go “from zero to one” in a myr­iad of in­dus­tries if they are to de­liver sus­tain­able and eq­ui­table growth for their large do­mes­tic pop­u­la­tions.

za,The Star Late Edition,20091112,"China is help­ing Africa, just not as fast as first promised","Trade be­tween China and Africa has boomed since a bullish sum­mit three years ago, but some promis­ing in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment projects have hit snags and de­lays. As a re­sult, both sides are likely to take a more sober and re­al­is­tic view of their re­la­tion­ship af­ter leaders met in Egypt on Novem­ber 8 and 9. What was all the hype about? Chi­nese of­fi­cials are quick to re­mind out­siders that ties with Africa date back as far as the 1400s and the Ming dy­nasty ad­mi­ral Zheng He, and were shaped more re­cently by the con­ti­nent’s strug­gle against colo­nial­ism. Over the last 20 years, the fo­cus has shifted from pol­i­tics to com­merce, with Africa and its vast un­tapped en­ergy and min­eral re­sources in­creas­ingly pro­vid­ing the raw ma­te­ri­als for China’s eco­nomic boom. In 2006, more than 30 African leaders went to Bei­jing for the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Focac) that for­malised the shift in African trade and in­vest­ment pol­icy away from the US and Europe. Prom­ises of lav­ish aid and as­sis­tance also served no­tice to the Wash­ing­ton-based In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund and World Bank that they were no longer the only sources of de­vel­op­ment fi­nance. The set-up was touted as a “new strate­gic part­ner­ship” that would fi­nally end poverty in Africa. It would pro­vide China with raw ma­te­ri­als, while Chi­nese cash and com­pa­nies would build an African ver­sion of China’s in­fra­struc­ture revo­lu­tion. And has it lived up to it? When Bei­jing talks “strate­gic”, it means a very long time – cer­tainly well be­yond the an­nual re­port­ing cy­cles of listed West­ern com­pa­nies. As such, it will not be judg­ing the suc­cess or fail­ure of a ven­ture on the out­come of its first three years. That said, prob­lems with in­fra­struc­ture-for-min­er­als deals in Nige­ria and the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo (DRC) have de­liv­ered a re­al­ity check to both sides: China has re­alised that work­ing in Africa is tough, and Africa has started to worry about sim­ply swap­ping per­ceived ex­ploita­tion by the West with per­ceived ex­ploita­tion by China. “The last Focac was the high-wa­ter mark, on both sides, of starry-eyed op­ti­mism about China-Africa en­gage­ment,” said Tom Cargill of Lon­don’s Royal In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs. “The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has re­alised do­ing busi­ness in many of th­ese coun­tries is a lot more com­pli­cated than pre­vi­ously thought, and African coun­tries have re­alised China is a big and im­por­tant coun­try – but ul­ti­mately just an­other coun­try.” What are the prob­lems? Lack of progress has been most no­table in Nige­ria, Africa’s big­gest prize due to its 36 bil­lion bar­rels of oil re­serves. Deals struck with Pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo, who left of­fice in 2007, are be­ing re­viewed amid con­cerns about graft and na­tional in­ter­est, and there is pre­cious lit­tle on the ground to show for the prom­ises of Chi­nese-built roads. China has fared bet­ter in An­gola, which ri­vals Nige­ria as Africa’s top oil pro­ducer, but in Septem­ber Luanda blocked the sale of a stake in an off­shore block to two Chi­nese firms, sug­gest­ing it does not want to be too re­liant on any one buyer. “There is an in­creas­ing wari­ness in some African cap­i­tals of re­plac­ing one kind of de­pen­dent re­la­tion­ship, and all its bag­gage, with an­other,” said Antony Gold­man of po­lit­i­cal risk firm PM Con­sult­ing. Chi­nese com­pa­nies build­ing roads and other in­fra­struc­ture have also been crit­i­cised for bring­ing their own labour and not pass­ing on skills and knowhow to Africans. African man­u­fac­tur­ers also com­plain about pres­sure from cheap Chi­nese im­ports, which have nev­er­the­less gone down very well with African con­sumers. But China is still big in Africa, right? De­spite the hic­cups, trade be­tween Africa and China has grown at 30 per­cent a year, climb­ing to $107 bil­lion (R795bn) in 2008 to eclipse the US for the first time. Ac­cord­ing to the South Africa-based Cen­tre for Chi­nese Stud­ies, im­ple­men­ta­tion of Focac pledges is “fairly ad­vanced” in An­gola, the DRC, Mozam­bique, Uganda and Tan­za­nia. China is also mov­ing into ar­eas such as agri­cul­ture – it has lent An­gola $1bn for farm­ing – and many African leaders still see work­ing with Bei­jing as the best way of get­ting things done. “The Chi­nese bring Africa what it needs: in­vest­ment and money for gov­ern­ments and com­pa­nies. China in­vests in in­fra­struc­ture, builds streets,” Rwan­dan Pres­i­dent Paul Kagame told a Ger­man news­pa­per last month. – Reuters",南非
za,The Mercury,20171101,Meet­ing needs for ‘a bet­ter life’,"CHI­NESE Am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian ad­dressed the me­dia in Pre­to­ria yes­ter­day on the out­comes of the Com­mu­nist Party of China’s (CPC) 19th Na­tional Congress, hav­ing re­turned from his coun­try’s most im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal meet­ing of the past five years, which was a his­toric mile­stone. The fun­da­men­tal out­come of the congress is that China will con­tinue striv­ing to build a moder­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety, with the goal of erad­i­cat­ing poverty by 2020. “The congress has formed two ma­jor po­lit­i­cal judge­ments. The first is that the prin­ci­ple con­tra­dic­tion in the Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved. It is now the con­tra­dic­tion be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life,” am­bas­sador Lin said. “In the past, the prin­ci­ple con­tra­dic­tion was be­tween the ever-grow­ing ma­te­rial and cul­tural needs of the peo­ple and the back­ward­ness of so­cial pro­duc­tion. To­day, the needs to be met for the peo­ple to live a bet­ter life are in­creas­ingly broad.” Lin shared with jour­nal­ists and aca­demics that to­day there are in­creas­ing de­mands for fair­ness and jus­tice, rule of law, se­cu­rity, en­vi­ron­ment, balanced ur­ban and ru­ral de­vel­op­ment, and eq­ui­table in­come dis­tri­bu­tion. Cen­tral to the out­comes of the congress is that so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics has en­tered a new era where from 2020-2035 China will strive to be­come a mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try, and will im­prove the qual­ity of de­vel­op­ment. “The congress laid out a new blue­print for China’s so­cial­ist mod­erni­sa­tion drive. This congress made com­pre­hen­sive plan­ning for China’s de­vel­op­ment from now to the mid-21st cen­tury,” Lin said. This new era will es­tab­lish so­cial­ist rule of law and com­pre­hen­sively ad­vance law-based gov­er­nance. Not only did the congress high­light the new era China is mov­ing into, and out­line the new blue­print for its de­vel­op­ment, but it laid out the new thought of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the CPC. “The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics is a ma­jor the­o­ret­i­cal in­no­va­tion by the CPC in the new era,” Lin re­marked. When Xi set forth the ba­sic pol­icy on de­vel­op­ment, gov­er­nance, and the mil­i­tary, it be­came a guid­ing prin­ci­ple to unite the party and its peo­ple. Most im­por­tantly, Xi’s thought was writ­ten into the CPC’s con­sti­tu­tion, which will en­sure the longevity of his ideas. Key to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of Xi’s vi­sion will be the new gen­er­a­tion of elected lead­ers which have joined the cen­tral com­mit­tee of the CPC. The congress pri­ori­tised dis­cus­sions on how to build a strong mil­i­tary, trans­form­ing the Peo­ples’ Forces to world-class forces. The CPC seeks to en­sure its lead­er­ship over the army. Key to dis­cus­sions was also Xi’s fo­cus on “strictly gov­ern­ing the party”, and how to in­sti­tu­tion­alise the fight against cor­rup­tion while main­tain­ing a demo­cratic sys­tem. “Xi de­picted the fight against cor­rup­tion as a never-end­ing strug­gle,” Lin said. The com­mit­ment to pu­n­ish the “tigers and the flies” in­di­cates a com­mit­ment to deal with the cor­rup­tion of both high and low-rank­ing party of­fi­cials. The congress also spoke of build­ing a new type of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions based on mu­tual re­spect in terms of sovereignty and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, as well as fair­ness, jus­tice, and win-win co-op­er­a­tion. What un­der­lies China’s for­eign pol­icy is the de­sire for an open and in­clu­sive world where there is peace and de­vel­op­ment, as this will en­sure a shared fu­ture for hu­mankind.",南非
za,The Star Early Edition,20191111,SA seeks China re­prieve,"SOUTH Africa is look­ing to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, the world’s sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy, as it seeks to reignite Africa’s most de­vel­oped econ­omy – pro­jected to grow only 0.6% this year. Diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween China and South Africa date back 20 years. Both are part of the BRICS bloc of coun­tries which have a com­bined GDP of $15 tril­lion (R222 tril­lion). The coun­try is re­garded as the top desti­na­tion of Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa, with a bi­lat­eral trade value of $39.17 bil­lion in 2017, which sub­se­quently grew 11.18% to more than $43bn last year. Chi­nese am­bas­sador to South Africa Lin Song­tian stated last year that the com­bined ex­ist­ing and planned di­rect Chi­nese in­vest­ment in South Africa reached more than $25bn in ac­cu­mu­la­tive terms by June 2017. This was spread across the man­u­fac­tur­ing, pro­cess­ing, min­ing, fi­nance, en­ergy, tourism, com­merce, and trade and ser­vices sec­tors. This was a much-needed shot in the arm for the econ­omy, which grew 0.8% last year, spurring Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa to ap­point in­vest­ment en­voys in his am­bi­tious quest to raise $100bn in new in­vest­ments over the next five years. The in­vest­ments were ex­pected to ad­dress the coun­try’s stag­ger­ing un­em­ploy­ment rate of 29%, the de­hu­man­is­ing poverty scourge and en­trenched in­equal­ity. South Africa con­tin­ues to carry the em­bar­rass­ing badge of be­ing “China needs ac­cess to re­sources while SA and Africa need in­vest­ment one of the most un­equal so­ci­eties in the world. The lo­cal econ­omy fell 3.2% or R56bn in the first quar­ter of this year, but re­bounded 3.1% in the sec­ond quar­ter after the key min­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing and trade sec­tors picked up and helped the coun­try avert slip­ping into a re­ces­sion. Slow eco­nomic and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment has been largely blamed on mis­man­age­ment. The Zondo Com­mis­sion into State Cap­ture has heard ev­i­dence of how the Gupta fam­ily, who were for­mer pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma’s per­sonal friends, used their prox­im­ity to him to raid the public purse and set up a par­al­lel gov­ern­ment aimed at ad­vanc­ing their busi­ness in­ter­ests. Ramaphosa told in­ter­na­tional in­vestors at the Fi­nan­cial Times Africa Sum­mit in Lon­don re­cently that state cap­ture may have cost the coun­try more than R500bn. Oth­ers es­ti­mate the fig­ure to be well over R1 tril­lion. In June, fol­low­ing Ramaphosa’s State of the Na­tion ad­dress, South African and Chi­nese busi­nesses signed a record 93 eco­nomic and trade pacts val­ued at more than R27bn. The pres­i­dent said the co-oper­a­tion agree­ments would help “boost pro­duc­tion, growth and jobs in the lo­cal econ­omy”. Chi­nese com­pa­nies with no­table in­vest­ments in South Africa in­clude ap­pli­ance and elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­turer Hisense and ve­hi­cle man­u­fac­tur­ers FAW and BAIC, which both have pro­duc­tion plants at the Coega spe­cial eco­nomic zone in Nel­son Man­dela Bay in Eastern Cape. In 2007, the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China ac­quired a 20% stake of Stan­dard Bank, Africa’s big­gest lender by as­sets, for about $5.5bn. These in­vest­ments have helped to stim­u­late the econ­omy and cre­ate much-needed jobs. On the min­ing front, Chi­nese in­vestors agreed to build a $10bn met­al­lur­gi­cal com­plex in the coun­try this year. The com­plex would be a stain­less-steel plant, a fer­rochrome plant, and a sil­i­co­man­ganese plant, ac­cord­ing to the Min­ing Ind­aba. De­spite these in­vest­ments, South Africa still has a long way to go in terms of at­tract­ing more for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) from China. Econ­o­mist Mike Schus­sler said that South Africa was def­i­nitely not do­ing enough work in at­tract­ing more Chi­nese busi­nesses to in­vest in the coun­try. He also be­moaned the fact that South Africa has fallen two places to rank 84th on the World Bank’s Do­ing Busi­ness re­port for 2020, re­leased on Oc­to­ber 23. South Africa, how­ever, was ranked fifth among African coun­tries. “The fact that we are ranked 84 does not bode well. We’ve got to make busi­ness con­fi­dence go up,” said Schus­sler. The RMB/BER Busi­ness Con­fi­dence In­dex slipped from 28 to 21 in the third quar­ter, reach­ing its low­est since 1999. The gov­ern­ment needed to cut bu­reau­cratic red tape and re­lax Black Eco­nomic Em­pow­er­ment reg­u­la­tions which scare in­vestors, added Schus­sler. Nel­son Man­dela Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Ongama Mtimka said there was a “very strong and clear agenda” by China to strengthen re­la­tions with Africa. “There has been a lot of strong in­vest­ments into the con­ti­nent, driven both by pri­vate and state-owned busi­nesses in China,” said Mtimka. “The turn­around times of Chi­nese in­vest­ments from de­ci­sion-mak­ing to break­ing ground are faster. Their in­vest­ment is not only in the cap­i­tal alone… they’re also investing in spe­cific projects like fac­to­ries. They are also in­ter­ested in min­ing… ” How­ever, there is a quid pro quo. China needs ac­cess to re­sources and South Africa and other African coun­tries need Chi­nese in­vest­ment.",南非

Chi­nese shares erased $3.9 tril­lion in less than a month, rais­ing con­cerns that it may hurt growth in the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy and curb global de­mand for com­modi­ties such as cop­per, coal and iron ore. South Africa is the world’s largest pro­ducer of plat­inum and also ex­ports gold, coal, iron ore and chrome. The ef­fect of Chi­nese mar­ket volatil­ity “on the real econ­omy re­mains to be seen, and there­fore the im­pact on the global 7th Brics sum­mit yesterday. The sum­mit brought to the fore the need for the five-na­tion bloc of emerg­ing economies to spur growth in a slug­gish global en­vi­ron­ment, Zuma told Brics Busi­ness Coun­cil mem­bers yesterday. He said the sum­mit took place against “the back­drop of an un­favourable global eco­nomic cli­mate char­ac­terised by the slug­gish eco­nomic re­cov­ery. The so­cio-eco­nomic chal­lenges that con­front de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are sim­i­lar, in­clud­ing poverty alle­vi­a­tion, cre­ation of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, re­duc­ing in­equal­ity in stan­dards of liv­ing and eco­nomic growth.” Speak­ing two days af­ter the launch of the Brics’s New De­vel­op­ment Bank (NDB), Zuma said the chal­lenges were not new, but Brics na­tions – Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa – had to use their new-found ca­pac­ity to deal with them. He added that Brics coun­tries were at the fore­front of global re­cov­ery, with ex­ports to the rest of the world in­creas­ing from $1.9 tril­lion (R23.7 tril­lion) in 2009 to $4.2 tril­lion in 2013.

za,Sunday Times,20111211,Africa — a con­ti­nent of hope,"AFRICA is on a fast track out of poverty. Its as­ton­ish­ing growth is mak­ing it an in­creas­ingly en­tic­ing desti­na­tion for global com­pa­nies as north­ern hemi­sphere economies con­tract and stut­ter. The scourges of poverty, dis­ease and war are fast re­treat­ing and in their place is emerg­ing a mid­dle class with a buy­ing power un­prece­dented on the con­ti­nent. “Hope­less Africa” was the ti­tle of the Econ­o­mist mag­a­zine’s May 11 2000 edi­tion, which came out just af­ter Bri­tish para­troop­ers had been sent to evac­u­ate Bri­tish cit­i­zens and peace­keep­ers from Free­town, the cap­i­tal of Sierra Leone, as rebel forces closed in. The lat­est edi­tion is ti­tled “Africa Ris­ing”. Africa is the fastest-grow­ing re­gion in the world, and the sta­tis­tics are com­pelling read­ing. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund says the con­ti­nent’s GDP grew on av­er­age 5.5% a year be­tween 2000 and 2010, com­pared to a global av­er­age of 4.4%. The IMF pre­dicts the economies of sub-sa­ha­ran Africa will grow by an av­er­age of 5.75% next year — af­ter re­vis­ing them down­ward due to the con­trac­tion in Europe and the US. Sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing Botswana, Nige­ria and the Repub­lic of Congo, are likely to hit growth rates of 8% and 9%. More than 10 sub­Sa­ha­ran African economies have ex­panded by more than 6% a year for six An es­ti­mated 600 mil­lion Africans — more than half — will have a cell­phone by next year or more years. Ethiopia, once faminer­id­dled, is ex­pected to have grown 7.5% in 2011. The fig­ures cited in the lat­est edi­tion of the Econ­o­mist are as­ton­ish­ing. Labour pro­duc­tiv­ity is grow­ing by about 2.7% a year, trade with the rest of the world has in­creased 200% in a decade, in­fla­tion has dropped from 22% in the 1990s to 8% in the past decade. For­eign debt has de­clined by a quar­ter in 10 years and bud­get deficits by about two-thirds. It is no won­der ex­pan­sion plans for South African com­pa­nies in­vari­ably in­volve a drive north­wards. Western multi­na­tion­als like IBM, Gen­eral Elec­tric and Proc­tor &amp; Gam­ble are ei­ther start­ing to move in or have done so al­ready and are ramp­ing up op­er­a­tions. Suc­cess­ful lo­cal early-africa adopters in­clude Sho­prite, Mass­mart, MTN and Stan­dard Bank. Much of Africa’s growth is be­ing driven by the re­source-hun­gry economies of China, In­dia and, to a rapidly-de­creas­ing de­gree, Europe. Emerg­ing mar­kets, ac­cord­ing In­vestec an­a­lyst Michael Power, will rep­re­sent 85% of global GDP growth in the com­ing decade, largely as a re­sult of the eco­nomic ex­plo­sions in In­dia and China, and be­cause of the slow­ing down of Europe and (to a lesser ex­tent) the US. But re­sources are not the whole story. Rel­a­tive po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity has played a big part in the con­ti­nent’s turn­around, and although there are flash­points and cor­rup­tion is per­va­sive and prob­lem­atic, wars are far less of a stan­dard fea­ture than they were a gen­er­a­tion ago. An­other growth driver has been the spread of tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially cell­phone tech­nol­ogy and, in­creas­ingly, mo­bile in­ter­net, which is pro­vid­ing global in­clu­siv­ity to even the most ru­ral Africans. An es­ti­mated 600 mil­lion Africans — more than half — will have a cell­phone by next year and about 10% of these will have ac­cess to the mo­bile in­ter­net. As well as com­mu­ni­ca­tion, cell­phones are in­te­gral to the up­take of bank­ing prod­ucts and they make it easy for com­pa­nies to com­mu­ni­cate with con­sumers and to ad­ver­tise. Med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, mos­quito nets and con­doms have driven down the growth-sap­ping in­ci­dence of malaria and Aids. How­ever, the sin­gle big­gest driver of growth in sub-sa­ha­ran Africa is its bur­geon­ing mid­dle class — which de­vel­oped ini­tially as a re­sult of re­source ex­ploita­tion, oil and aid, but has be­come in­creas­ingly self-sus­tain­ing and grow­ing. Ac­cord­ing to Ac­cen­ture, the num­ber of con­sumers in sub-sa­ha­ran Africa will in­crease from 856 mil­lion in 2010 to 1.3 bil­lion by 2030. Poverty, at lev­els of about 40% in 1980, dropped be­low 30% by 2008 and is ex­pected to fall to about 20% by 2020. Grant Hatch, who heads up strat­egy and prod­ucts at Ac­cen­ture South Africa, said the growth in consumer For­eign debt has de­clined by a quar­ter in 10 years and bud­get deficits by about two-thirds spend­ing, as well as govern­ment in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing, has pushed up em­ploy­ment rates — both in­for­mally and for­mally. This has re­sulted in economies with their own im­pe­tus and for which nat­u­ral re­sources are be­com­ing less and less im­por­tant. Hatch said com­pa­nies that have done best have been those that have been sen­si­tive to the way busi­ness is done and have adapted their prod­uct, model and mar­ket­ing to the spe­cific needs of the con­sumers. ’",南非

Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials there are build­ing one of the world’s 30 tallest build­ings, a 2.5 bil­lion yuan, 328m tower. The re­volv­ing restau­rant atop the so-called New Vil­lage in the Sky of­fers sweep­ing views of paddy fields, fish ponds and or­chards. Marc Faber, the pub­lisher of the Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Re­port, said China was over­do­ing it. “It does not make sense for China to build more empty build­ings and add to ca­pac­i­ties in in­dus­tries where you al­ready have over­ca­pac­ity,” ac­cord­ing to Faber. “I think the econ­omy will de­cel­er­ate very sub­stan­tially in 2010 and could even crash,” added Faber. Huaxi has an even more am­bi­tious project com­ing up: a 6 bil­lion yuan, 538m sky­scraper that would rank as the world’s tallest af­ter Dubai’s new Burj Khal­ifa. Such un­der­tak­ings fig­ured in warn­ings that Jim Chanos, the pres­i­dent of Kynikos As­so­ci­ates, made last month that China is Dubai times a thou­sand. The costs of waste­ful in­vest­ments in empty offices and shop­ping malls and in un­der­utilised in­fra­struc­ture would weigh on China, Chanos said. “We may find that that is what pops the Chi­nese bub­ble sooner rather than later.” China has de­fied the global re­ces­sion of the past two years and re­mained the fastest grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct soared 10.7 per­cent in the fourth quar­ter of last year. The gov­ern­ment has pro­vided 4 tril­lion yuan in stimu- lus spending and en­cour­aged banks to lend a record 9.59 tril­lion yuan last year, try­ing to bridge the gap un­til de­mand for ex­ports re­bounds. Last month, the coun­try’s bank­ing groups lent a fur­ther 1.39 tril­lion yuan – al­most one-fifth of the tar­get amount for the whole of this year. Also last month, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment climbed 7.8 per­cent to $8.13bn (R62.5bn). Re­tail sales dur­ing last week’s Lu­nar New Year hol­i­day rose 17.2 per­cent from the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Com­merce. While China’s re­silience has helped sup­port the world econ­omy, rais­ing de­mand for en­ergy and raw ma­te­ri­als, the burst­ing of a bub­ble would have the op­po­site ef­fect. Gov­ern­ment ef­forts to wean the econ­omy off its ex­traor­di­nary sup­port may roil mar­kets. Last month, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment or­dered banks to curb lend­ing, which put China’s stock mar­ket into re­verse. In a sign, in part, of how de­pen­dent the world has be­come on China, stocks and cur­ren­cies slumped in places such as Aus­tralia and Brazil that sup­ply com­modi­ties to China. On Fe­bru­ary 12, China for the sec­ond time in a month or­dered banks to set aside more de­posits as re­serves. The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite in­dex has fallen 8 per­cent year-to-date, af­ter gain­ing 80 per­cent last year. “If the Chi­nese econ­omy de­cel­er­ates or crashes, what you have is a dis­as­trous en­vi­ron­ment for in­dus­trial com­modi­ties,” said Faber. – Bloomberg",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20081209,Spate of safety scan­dals rocks shop­pers’ faith in China,"Milk, tooth­paste, cough syrup, pet food, eels, blood thin­ner, car parts, pork, eggs, honey, chicken, dumplings, cook­ing oil and rice – if you can fake it or taint it, you can al­most guar­an­tee it’s hap­pened in China. A string of prod­uct safety scan­dals, in­clud­ing con­tam­i­nated in­fant for­mula be­lieved to have killed six ba­bies and sick­ened thou­sands of oth­ers, have rocked the faith of shop­pers, mak­ing them wary of buy­ing prod­ucts made in China de­spite the of­ten cheaper price tag. “I was phys­i­cally dis­gusted when I saw it on the TV,” said Sally Vil­le­gas, a mother of two in Aus­tralia, re­fer­ring to the me­lamine-tainted in­fant for­mula scan­dal that came to light in Septem­ber. “If I’m shop­ping and I pick up a prod­uct made in China … I would put it back.” The me­lamine scan­dal was the lat­est in a string of re­cent high-pro­file safety prob­lems that in­clude lead paint on toy cars and con­tam­i­nated Chi­ne­se­made blood thin­ner hep­arin, which was blamed for fatal­i­ties in the US and Ger­many and prompted a global re­call early this year. Af­ter each scan­dal, Bei­jing of­fi­cials seemed to have the same re­sponse: launch a crack­down, de­stroy tainted goods on tele­vi­sion, jail a few of­fi­cials and say they “pay great at­ten­tion” to the prob­lem. Trou­ble is, for all the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts and ex­hor­ta­tions, the scan­dals keep hap­pen­ing, and will likely keep on hap­pen­ing, be­cause of lax rule en­force­ment, frag­mented in­dus­tries, wide­spread poverty and the sheer size of China, an­a­lysts say. “I’m sure that there will be more [scan­dals]. It’s a near cer­tain. Not only in the fields that we’ve seen al­ready, but in other ones,” said Dun­can Innes-Ker, a China an­a­lyst at the Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit in Bei­jing. “China faces a lot of prob­lems be­cause it is de­vel­op­ing into a big but very poor econ­omy, and ob­vi­ously you can’t have West­ern-style safety mech­a­nisms in an econ­omy where half the pop­u­la­tion doesn’t earn much more than a cou­ple of dol­lars a day,” he added. Jin Biao, the vice-pres­i­dent of In­ner Mon­go­lia Yili In­dus­trial Group, one of China’s largest dairy pro­duc­ers, ad­mit­ted that the me­lamine prob­lem had dented the coun­try’s al­ready badly tat­tered rep­u­ta­tion over­seas. “The con­tam­i­na­tion was our man­age­ment prob­lem,” he told Reuters. “We must first re­solve it without try­ing to pass the blame on to the farm­ers, or to so­ci­ety, or the coun­try.” Yili was named as one of 22 com­pa­nies found to have pro­duced drink­ing milk con­tam­i­nated with me­lamine, al­though af­ter thor­ough in­spec­tions China now in­sists the prob­lem has been ef­fec­tively re­moved from the dairy in­dus­try. Me­lamine, a chem­i­cal used to make plas­tics, was added to in­fant for­mula to cheat qual­ity con­trol tests on pro­tein lev­els. The scan­dal led to bans around the world on food con­tain­ing Chi­nese dairy prod­ucts. The US last month is­sued an im­port alert for Chi­nese-made food prod­ucts, call­ing for foods to be stopped at the bor­der un­less im­porters could cer­tify that they were ei­ther free of dairy goods or free of me­lamine. “I think it’s ev­i­dent to the Chi­nese that when there’s a qual­ity prob­lem, it does more than just hurt that in­dus­try seg­ment,” US health sec­re­tary Mike Leav­itt said on a visit to Shang­hai. “It dam­ages the en­tire made-in-China brand.” But it was not a sim­ple mat­ter just to boy­cott all Chi­nese goods, said Matthew Crabbe, the manag­ing di­rec­tor of re­search firm Ac­cess Asia. “I don’t think peo­ple re­ally un­der­stand how much is ac­tu­ally made in China,” he said.",南非

Focac is a ma­jor plat­form of China-Africa col­lec­tive di­a­logue, unity and co-oper­a­tion es­tab­lished in re­sponse to the new de­vel­op­ment needs of China-Africa re­la­tions. Over the past 18 years since its in­cep­tion, Focac has es­tab­lished a set of com­pre­hen­sive, prac­ti­cal and highly ef­fi­cient mech­a­nisms, which con­sist of min­is­te­rial meet­ings, se­nior of­fi­cials meet­ing, China’s Sec­re­tariat of the Fol­low-Up Com­mit­tee and the meet­ing mech­a­nism of African am­bas­sadors to China. Focac con­venes the min­is­te­rial meet­ing ev­ery three years to make new plans for China-Africa friendly and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-oper­a­tion. The se­nior of­fi­cials meet­ing is held yearly to fa­cil­i­tate co-or­di­na­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion. Over the years, through nu­mer­ous vis­i­ble and tan­gi­ble co-oper­a­tion out­comes, Focac has proved that it is not a talk shop, but a fo­rum for ac­tion. To­day, Focac has al­ready be­come a flag­ship that spear­heads the co-oper­a­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity with Africa. Equal­ity and mu­tual trust, prac­ti­cal re­sults and high ef­fi­ciency, and win-win co-oper­a­tion are the defin­ing fea­tures of Focac, as well as the com­mon pur­suit of all Focac mem­bers. Focac is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing African coun­tries as they achieve self-sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. It is our strong be­lief that if Africa is not in­de­pen­dent eco­nom­i­cally, it is im­pos­si­ble to be in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cally. With­out eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, it is im­pos­si­ble to es­cape poverty and con­flict. To achieve self-sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, African coun­tries need to break through three bot­tle­necks, namely backward in­fra­struc­ture, lack of pro­fes­sional and skilled per­son­nel, and a lack of cap­i­tal sources. Who can help Africa re­solve those prob­lems, who is the true friend of Africa? In De­cem­ber 2015, dur­ing the Focac Jo­han­nes­burg Sum­mit, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and African lead­ers jointly opened up the new era of China-Africa win-win co-oper­a­tion for com­mon de­vel­op­ment. Xi an­nounced Ten Ma­jor Co-op­er­a­tive Plans with $60 bil­lion of fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment to sup­port African in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion. These ef­forts have ef­fec­tively sup­ported Africa to over­come the bot­tle­necks. The China-Africa co-oper­a­tion in the new era is no longer about cut­ting an equal share of the “cake” for every­one. In­stead, those who are ready first will ben­e­fit first, and the most. China-Africa mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-oper­a­tion in the new era will no longer be re­stricted to de­vel­op­ment aid, but will be based on the prin­ci­ple of “govern­ment guid­ance, busi­nesses be­ing the ma­jor ac­tors, mar­ket oper­a­tion and win-win co-oper­a­tion”. Over the years, Focac has achieved nu­mer­ous vis­i­ble and tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits for our peo­ples. China-Africa trade has in­creased from just more than $10bn in 2000 to $170bn last year. Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa has soared from less than $1bn in 2000 to more than $100bn. To date, China has helped fi­nance and build for Africa 6 500km of rail­ways, 6 200km of roads, 20 sea­ports, 20 bridges, more than 80 power plants, more than 200 schools and 80-plus sta­di­ums. Since 2016, China has pro­vided over 10 000 govern­ment schol­ar­ships to African coun­tries per year. These ef­forts have greatly boosted Africa’s ca­pac­ity build­ing, mak­ing unique and im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to Africa’s pur­suit of self-sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Themed “China and Africa: To­ward an Even Stronger Com­mu­nity with a Shared Future through Win-Win Co-oper­a­tion”, the Focac Beijing Sum­mit is ex­pected to adopt the Beijing Dec­la­ra­tion and the Beijing Ac­tion Plan (2019-2021). The sum­mit will not only make com­pre­hen­sive plans for China-Africa co-oper­a­tion for the next three years, but also fur­ther align the sum­mit’s theme with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment, the AU’s Agenda 2063 and the de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of in­di­vid­ual African coun­tries. More ef­forts will be made and more mea­sures will be taken to sup­port African coun­tries in ca­pac­ity build­ing, in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity, in­dus­try co-oper­a­tion, green de­vel­op­ment, trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, pub­lic health, people-to-people ex­change, peace and se­cu­rity, and in­ter­na­tional co-oper­a­tion. We are full of con­fi­dence that the Focac Beijing Sum­mit will fur­ther strengthen Africa’s ca­pac­ity for self-sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, pro­mote stronger China-Africa win-win co-oper­a­tion for com­mon de­vel­op­ment, and bring more ben­e­fits to all the peo­ples of Africa and China.",南非
za,Sunday Times,20111211,Africa — a con­ti­nent of hope,"AFRICA is on a fast track out of poverty. Its as­ton­ish­ing growth is mak­ing it an in­creas­ingly en­tic­ing desti­na­tion for global com­pa­nies as north­ern hemi­sphere economies con­tract and stut­ter. The scourges of poverty, dis­ease and war are fast re­treat­ing and in their place is emerg­ing a mid­dle class with a buy­ing power un­prece­dented on the con­ti­nent. “Hope­less Africa” was the ti­tle of the Econ­o­mist mag­a­zine’s May 11 2000 edi­tion, which came out just af­ter Bri­tish para­troop­ers had been sent to evac­u­ate Bri­tish cit­i­zens and peace­keep­ers from Free­town, the cap­i­tal of Sierra Leone, as rebel forces closed in. The lat­est edi­tion is ti­tled “Africa Ris­ing”. Africa is the fastest-grow­ing re­gion in the world, and the sta­tis­tics are com­pelling read­ing. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund says the con­ti­nent’s GDP grew on av­er­age 5.5% a year be­tween 2000 and 2010, com­pared to a global av­er­age of 4.4%. The IMF pre­dicts the economies of sub-sa­ha­ran Africa will grow by an av­er­age of 5.75% next year — af­ter re­vis­ing them down­ward due to the con­trac­tion in Europe and the US. Sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing Botswana, Nige­ria and the Repub­lic of Congo, are likely to hit growth rates of 8% and 9%. More than 10 sub­Sa­ha­ran African economies have ex­panded by more than 6% a year for six An es­ti­mated 600 mil­lion Africans — more than half — will have a cell­phone by next year or more years. Ethiopia, once faminer­id­dled, is ex­pected to have grown 7.5% in 2011. The fig­ures cited in the lat­est edi­tion of the Econ­o­mist are as­ton­ish­ing. Labour pro­duc­tiv­ity is grow­ing by about 2.7% a year, trade with the rest of the world has in­creased 200% in a decade, in­fla­tion has dropped from 22% in the 1990s to 8% in the past decade. For­eign debt has de­clined by a quar­ter in 10 years and bud­get deficits by about two-thirds. It is no won­der ex­pan­sion plans for South African com­pa­nies in­vari­ably in­volve a drive north­wards. Western multi­na­tion­als like IBM, Gen­eral Elec­tric and Proc­tor &amp; Gam­ble are ei­ther start­ing to move in or have done so al­ready and are ramp­ing up op­er­a­tions. Suc­cess­ful lo­cal early-africa adopters in­clude Sho­prite, Mass­mart, MTN and Stan­dard Bank. Much of Africa’s growth is be­ing driven by the re­source-hun­gry economies of China, In­dia and, to a rapidly-de­creas­ing de­gree, Europe. Emerg­ing mar­kets, ac­cord­ing In­vestec an­a­lyst Michael Power, will rep­re­sent 85% of global GDP growth in the com­ing decade, largely as a re­sult of the eco­nomic ex­plo­sions in In­dia and China, and be­cause of the slow­ing down of Europe and (to a lesser ex­tent) the US. But re­sources are not the whole story. Rel­a­tive po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity has played a big part in the con­ti­nent’s turn­around, and although there are flash­points and cor­rup­tion is per­va­sive and prob­lem­atic, wars are far less of a stan­dard fea­ture than they were a gen­er­a­tion ago. An­other growth driver has been the spread of tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially cell­phone tech­nol­ogy and, in­creas­ingly, mo­bile in­ter­net, which is pro­vid­ing global in­clu­siv­ity to even the most ru­ral Africans. An es­ti­mated 600 mil­lion Africans — more than half — will have a cell­phone by next year and about 10% of these will have ac­cess to the mo­bile in­ter­net. As well as com­mu­ni­ca­tion, cell­phones are in­te­gral to the up­take of bank­ing prod­ucts and they make it easy for com­pa­nies to com­mu­ni­cate with con­sumers and to ad­ver­tise. Med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, mos­quito nets and con­doms have driven down the growth-sap­ping in­ci­dence of malaria and Aids. How­ever, the sin­gle big­gest driver of growth in sub-sa­ha­ran Africa is its bur­geon­ing mid­dle class — which de­vel­oped ini­tially as a re­sult of re­source ex­ploita­tion, oil and aid, but has be­come in­creas­ingly self-sus­tain­ing and grow­ing. Ac­cord­ing to Ac­cen­ture, the num­ber of con­sumers in sub-sa­ha­ran Africa will in­crease from 856 mil­lion in 2010 to 1.3 bil­lion by 2030. Poverty, at lev­els of about 40% in 1980, dropped be­low 30% by 2008 and is ex­pected to fall to about 20% by 2020. Grant Hatch, who heads up strat­egy and prod­ucts at Ac­cen­ture South Africa, said the growth in consumer For­eign debt has de­clined by a quar­ter in 10 years and bud­get deficits by about two-thirds spend­ing, as well as govern­ment in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing, has pushed up em­ploy­ment rates — both in­for­mally and for­mally. This has re­sulted in economies with their own im­pe­tus and for which nat­u­ral re­sources are be­com­ing less and less im­por­tant. Hatch said com­pa­nies that have done best have been those that have been sen­si­tive to the way busi­ness is done and have adapted their prod­uct, model and mar­ket­ing to the spe­cific needs of the con­sumers. ’",南非
za,Cape Times,20191204,"If China can de­velop, then why not Africa?","CHI­NESE Am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian posed the ques­tion to renowned schol­ars from China and Africa yes­ter­day at the his­toric gov­er­nance and so­cioe­co­nomic de­vel­op­ment con­fer­ence in Tsh­wane: “If China can suc­ceed in de­vel­op­ing, why not Africa?” Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping agreed with African lead­ers at the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-oper­a­tion (Fo­cac) Sum­mit last year to deepen peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and to fa­cil­i­tate ex­changes on gov­er­nance and so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. This prom­ise has been kept with the of­fi­cial open­ing of the China Africa In­sti­tute (CAI) in Beijing in April this year, and with the Sym­po­sium on Gov­er­nance and So­cio-eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment co-hosted by the Hu­man Sciences Re­search Coun­cil (HSRC) and the CAI this week in Tsh­wane. Pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese Acad­emy of So­cial Sciences, Xie Fuzhan, led a del­e­ga­tion to South Africa to the sym­po­sium, which was at­tended by govern­ment of­fi­cials, ex­perts and schol­ars from China and the con­ti­nent. “We need to cre­ate the op­por­tu­nity to share ideas on where to go and how to get there,” Chi­nese am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian said in his keynote ad­dress. Song­tian cred­ited China’s un­par­al­leled de­vel­op­ment suc­cess in such a short space of time to its gov­er­nance ca­pac­ity, and the com­mit­ment of the Com­mu­nist Party of China to “put peo­ple first”. Song­tian noted that China achieved long-term so­cial and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, a pre­con­di­tion for pros­per­ity and rapid de­vel­op­ment. Song­tian high­lighted China’s achieve­ments, such as its an­nual av­er­age growth rate of 9.5%, and its per capita GDP hav­ing gone from $35 in 1949, to $156 in 1978, to $10000 (R146000) in 2019. To­day, l ess than 3% of the Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion live in poverty, and the coun­try is the largest trader and man­u­fac­turer, has the largest for­eign ex­change re­serves, and sends $1.9 tril­lion in for­eign direct in­vest­ment out of the coun­try. “We must work to­gether for com­mon pros­per­ity. The West will never agree, be­cause we jump over them. They are scared and try to con­tain China,” Song­tian said. The stated pur­pose of the 10 ma­jor co­op­er­a­tion plans of Fo­cac is to help the African con­ti­nent fa­cil­i­tate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion. Fuzhan ar­gued that China’s gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence pro­vided a ref­er­ence for those who wanted to ac­cel­er­ate de­vel­op­ment. “China re­spects de­vel­op­ment mod­els that suit de­vel­op­ment con­di­tions, and we don’t say that oth­ers have to copy China,” Fuzhan said. The chief ex­ec­u­tive of the HSRC, Crain Sou­dien, called this week’s con­fer­ence “his­toric,” and hailed the cre­ation of the CAI, call­ing it a ma­jor plat­form for col­lab­o­ra­tion to bring to­gether pol­i­cy­mak­ers. He char­ac­terised the role of the HSRC in such col­lab­o­ra­tion as be­ing to act as an ex­change plat­form to deepen un­der­stand­ing, de­velop re­search pro­grammes, train pro­fes­sion­als, and sup­port schol­ars through ex­changes and sem­i­nars. THE STAND­ING com­mit­tee on public ac­counts (Scopa) wants the top 20 mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties that owe Eskom R26 bil­lion to sub­mit pay­ment plans to the com­mit­tee early next year. This also ap­plies to govern­ment de­part­ments that owe mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties a whop­ping R118bn in rates and ser­vices. This emerged yes­ter­day when Scopa was briefed on debt owed to Eskom and mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties as well as in­ter­ven­tions be­ing un­der­taken to pay the amounts. Scopa chair­per­son Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the debt was a se­ri­ous con­cern to the com­mit­tee and they wanted con­crete ac­tion taken to re­solve the matter. “This kind of in­ac­tion in the face of es­ca­lat­ing debt is not ac­cept­able,” he said. Dur­ing the Scopa meet­ing, MPs heard that debt owed by mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties to wa­ter trad­ing en­ti­ties and wa­ter boards stood at R14.9bn at the end of Septem­ber. Brief­ing the com­mit­tee, Co-op­er­a­tive Gov­er­nance and Tra­di­tional Af­fairs deputy di­rec­tor-gen­eral for in­sti­tu­tional de­vel­op­ment Kevin Naidoo said that mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties were owed a to­tal of R165.5bn with the govern­ment, busi­ness and house­holds sit­ting at R10.2bn, R24.7bn and R118bn re­spec­tively. Naidoo said the Eskom debt had in­creased be­tween March 2016 un­til March 2019 by R7bn. The Eskom debt stood at R26 bil­lion with only 11 pay­ment ar­range­ments out of 49 be­ing fully hon­oured. Naidoo said the na­tional Depart­ment of Public Works owed R3bn and provin­cial public works de­part­ments owed R3.7bn. South African Lo­cal Govern­ment As­so­ci­a­tion (Salga) pres­i­dent Thembi Nkadi­meng com­plained about the money owed to mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties by govern­ment and busi­ness. She noted that they were col­lect­ing less in ar­eas where Eskom was sell­ing elec­tric­ity di­rectly to cus­tomers be­cause they could not ef­fect credit con­trol mea­sures. “We can’t cut elec­tric­ity to en­tice cus­tomers to pay for their wa­ter,” Nkadi­meng said. But Eskom board chair­per­son Jabu Mabuza said he noted that mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties were owed R165bn, but Salga “must find their money from who­ever owes them”. “We have to col­lect our debt or we stop sup­ply­ing cus­tomers not pay­ing us.

za,The Mercury,20081209,Spate of safety scan­dals rocks shop­pers’ faith in China,"Milk, tooth­paste, cough syrup, pet food, eels, blood thin­ner, car parts, pork, eggs, honey, chicken, dumplings, cook­ing oil and rice – if you can fake it or taint it, you can al­most guar­an­tee it’s hap­pened in China. A string of prod­uct safety scan­dals, in­clud­ing con­tam­i­nated in­fant for­mula be­lieved to have killed six ba­bies and sick­ened thou­sands of oth­ers, have rocked the faith of shop­pers, mak­ing them wary of buy­ing prod­ucts made in China de­spite the of­ten cheaper price tag. “I was phys­i­cally dis­gusted when I saw it on the TV,” said Sally Vil­le­gas, a mother of two in Aus­tralia, re­fer­ring to the me­lamine-tainted in­fant for­mula scan­dal that came to light in Septem­ber. “If I’m shop­ping and I pick up a prod­uct made in China … I would put it back.” The me­lamine scan­dal was the lat­est in a string of re­cent high-pro­file safety prob­lems that in­clude lead paint on toy cars and con­tam­i­nated Chi­ne­se­made blood thin­ner hep­arin, which was blamed for fatal­i­ties in the US and Ger­many and prompted a global re­call early this year. Af­ter each scan­dal, Bei­jing of­fi­cials seemed to have the same re­sponse: launch a crack­down, de­stroy tainted goods on tele­vi­sion, jail a few of­fi­cials and say they “pay great at­ten­tion” to the prob­lem. Trou­ble is, for all the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts and ex­hor­ta­tions, the scan­dals keep hap­pen­ing, and will likely keep on hap­pen­ing, be­cause of lax rule en­force­ment, frag­mented in­dus­tries, wide­spread poverty and the sheer size of China, an­a­lysts say. “I’m sure that there will be more [scan­dals]. It’s a near cer­tain. Not only in the fields that we’ve seen al­ready, but in other ones,” said Dun­can Innes-Ker, a China an­a­lyst at the Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit in Bei­jing. “China faces a lot of prob­lems be­cause it is de­vel­op­ing into a big but very poor econ­omy, and ob­vi­ously you can’t have West­ern-style safety mech­a­nisms in an econ­omy where half the pop­u­la­tion doesn’t earn much more than a cou­ple of dol­lars a day,” he added. Jin Biao, the vice-pres­i­dent of In­ner Mon­go­lia Yili In­dus­trial Group, one of China’s largest dairy pro­duc­ers, ad­mit­ted that the me­lamine prob­lem had dented the coun­try’s al­ready badly tat­tered rep­u­ta­tion over­seas. “The con­tam­i­na­tion was our man­age­ment prob­lem,” he told Reuters. “We must first re­solve it without try­ing to pass the blame on to the farm­ers, or to so­ci­ety, or the coun­try.” Yili was named as one of 22 com­pa­nies found to have pro­duced drink­ing milk con­tam­i­nated with me­lamine, al­though af­ter thor­ough in­spec­tions China now in­sists the prob­lem has been ef­fec­tively re­moved from the dairy in­dus­try. Me­lamine, a chem­i­cal used to make plas­tics, was added to in­fant for­mula to cheat qual­ity con­trol tests on pro­tein lev­els. The scan­dal led to bans around the world on food con­tain­ing Chi­nese dairy prod­ucts. The US last month is­sued an im­port alert for Chi­nese-made food prod­ucts, call­ing for foods to be stopped at the bor­der un­less im­porters could cer­tify that they were ei­ther free of dairy goods or free of me­lamine. “I think it’s ev­i­dent to the Chi­nese that when there’s a qual­ity prob­lem, it does more than just hurt that in­dus­try seg­ment,” US health sec­re­tary Mike Leav­itt said on a visit to Shang­hai. “It dam­ages the en­tire made-in-China brand.” But it was not a sim­ple mat­ter just to boy­cott all Chi­nese goods, said Matthew Crabbe, the manag­ing di­rec­tor of re­search firm Ac­cess Asia. “I don’t think peo­ple re­ally un­der­stand how much is ac­tu­ally made in China,” he said.",南非

za,The Star Late Edition,20100412,Eas­ing the bur­den of aid on Africa,"UR LOVE af­fair with Africa is over,” a West­ern for­eign pol­icy ad­viser stay­ing at The Melville House told me as we clinked wine glasses one rainy evening a fort­night ago. He rep­re­sented a Scan­di­na­vian coun­try, but his ac­count of the re­think go­ing on in his gov­ern­ment over de­vel­op­ment aid to Africa mir­rored the views of a North Amer­i­can guest I’d talked to on the same sub­ject a few days ear­lier. “It’s the end of an era,” one of them ex­plained. “Af­ter so many years of pro­vid­ing money to African gov­ern­ments without see­ing re­sults from it, we are chang­ing course.” The rea­sons for this shift in West­ern pol­icy have been de­bated for decades but cul­mi­nate in a sin­gle word: cor­rup­tion. “Our tax­pay­ers are tired of wast­ing their do­na­tions on African leaders who spend the sup­port given di­rectly to their gov­ern­ments on them­selves and their favourites. With good in­ten­tions be­trayed in Oslo, Copen­hagen, Lon­don and Am­s­ter­dam over many years, Europe’s cit­i­zens have watched African pres­i­dents buy planes for their own use rather than as­sist the poor or im­prove in­fra­struc­ture. “Post-colo­nial sen­si­tiv­i­ties meant that we agreed in the past not to in­ter­fere in African de­ci­sion-mak­ing, but it has been ir­ri­tat­ing… to watch our money be­ing squan­dered. We don’t want to do it any­more.” To by­pass Africa’s gen­er­ally cor­rupt lead­er­ship, my pol­icy-mak­ing guests ex­plained, west­ern gov­ern­ments were con­sid­er­ing mi­cro-fi­nanc­ing op­tions, in­fras­truc­tural in­vest­ments along the lines of Chi­nese pol­icy in Africa, as well as work­ing through cor­po­rates that obey in­ter­na­tional rules of trans­parency. Fas­ci­nated by their west­ern per­spec­tives, I have since read a re­lated African book, Dead Aid, by Dam­bisa Moyo. She asks why most sub-Sa­ha­ran coun­tries “floun­der in a seem­ingly never-end­ing cy­cle of cor­rup­tion, dis­ease, poverty and aid-de­pen­dency”, de­spite hav­ing re­ceived more than $300 bil­lion in de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance since 1970. Her an­swer is that African coun­tries are poor be­cause of the aid. De­spite the West’s well-mean­ing be­lief that the world’s rich should help its poor and make poverty his­tory, she con­tends that “aid has been, and con­tin­ues to be, an un­mit­i­gated po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and hu­man­i­tar­ian dis­as­ter for most parts of the de­vel­op­ing world”. Over the past 30 years, the most aid­de­pen­dent coun­tries have ex­hib­ited an av­er­age an­nual growth rate of -0.2 per­cent, ac­cord­ing to Moyo. Be­tween 1970 and 1998, when aid flows to Africa were at their peak, the poverty rate in Africa rose from 11 per­cent to 66 per­cent. Why? Moyo be­lieves that it is the re­sult of non-emer­gency loans and grants hav­ing the same ef­fect in Africa as the dis­cov­ery of a valu­able nat­u­ral re­source like oil. “It’s a kind of curse be­cause it en­cour­ages cor­rup­tion and con­flict, while at the same time dis­cour­ag­ing free en­ter­prise.” One of the direst con­se­quences of con­ces­sion­ary aid in Africa is the legacy of debt re­pay­ment faced by bank­rupt coun­tries af­ter their leaders have nicked the loans and grants. Moyo agrees with my west­ern guests that more and bet­ter aid should be given to poor coun­tries, but em­phat­i­cally not via the gov­ern­ments of cor­rupt leaders. She con­cludes: “Al­though the Dead Aid the­sis might be con­tro­ver­sial, it car­ries an im­por­tant mes­sage. The lives of bil­lions rest on get­ting the right fi­nanc­ing so­lu­tions to the prob­lems of de­vel­op­ing na­tions. Af­ter more than five decades of the wrong di­ag­no­sis, it is time now to turn the cor­ner and take the harder but in­dis­putably bet­ter road.” Like my for­eign af­fairs guests, Moyo reck­ons that China’s pol­icy of large-scale di­rect in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture is an im­por­tant part of the way for­ward. (China in­vested $900 mil­lion in Africa in 2004, com­pared with just $20 mil­lion in 1975.) The Scan­di­na­vian pol­icy-maker told me that, while west­ern gov­ern­ments were afraid that they might not be able to with­stand Chi­nese com­pe­ti­tion in their trade re­la­tions with Africa, there was grudg­ing recog­ni­tion that China has a long-term per­spec­tive that in­cludes an in­ter­est in good gov­er­nance on the con­ti­nent, “hav­ing burnt their fin­gers in Congo”. He re­vealed: “There was a shift in the west­ern de­bate around 2007, at a time when cli­mate change pol­icy was evolv­ing, and our dis­cus­sions started to fo­cus on big Euro­pean and Amer­i­can com­pa­nies as agents of change. They had been brib­ing Africans and mak­ing pub­lic of­fi­cials cor­rupt so there was a need for more cor­po­rate re­spon­si­bil­ity. “But there was also a grow­ing de­bate, es­pe­cially in cases where West­ern com­pa­nies are partly state-owned, that what’s good for the west­ern com­pany in Africa is also good for the donor state. NGOs or civil so­ci­ety could con­tinue to im­ple­ment and im­prove so­cial poli­cies while cor­po­rate com­pa­nies com­ply­ing with in­ter­na­tional stan­dards would con­duct in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment.” Sur­pris­ingly, and con­trary to the pop­u­lar view of a men­ac­ing China with its or­gias­tic em­brace of mar­ket mech­a­nisms ruth­lessly plun­der­ing Africa’s re­sources, west­ern ap­proaches to the con­ces­sion­ary aid dilemma seem to be con­verg­ing with China’s pol­icy of eco­nomic rather than quasi-po­lit­i­cal en­gage­ment on a trou­bled con­ti­nent. In fact, I got the im­pres­sion from my guests that there may soon be a traf­fic jam on the road to Da­m­as­cus, as a wag once de­scribed a sim­i­larly un­ex­pected in­ter­na­tional for­eign pol­icy U-turn. So al­though Africa’s ro­mance with the West has gone sour, a new era that recog­nises the long trade mar­riage be­tween west­ern coun­tries and African gov­ern­ments as a purely eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tion (al­beit driven by Chi­nese prag­ma­tism) will help to pro­mote pros­per­ity on the con­ti­nent. It will cer­tainly be more ben­e­fi­cial to or­di­nary Africans than the west­ern hand­outs of the past, and may im­prove gov­er­nance. “In­deed, some African leaders are al­ready ask­ing for in­vest­ments through big com­pa­nies rather than for gov­ern­ment loans,” said my Scan­di­na­vian guest as we clinked our glasses again.",南非

But de­liv­er­ing relief sup­plies to vic­tims has been se­verely ham­pered by im­pass­able roads, a col­lapsed in­fra­struc­ture and, re­port­edly, a short­age of air­craft ca­pa­ble of land­ing on a short run­way.

Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who an­nounced the $60bn pack­age on Fri­day, said it com­prised a 10-point plan that would fo­cus on help­ing ad­dress three pri­mary bot­tle­necks hin­der­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely lack of in­fra­struc­ture, skills and fund­ing.

The pledge came in the form of grants, zero-in­ter­est loans, favourable con­ces­sional loans, ex­port credit lines, debt re­lief, a spe­cial loan for the de­vel­op­ment of African small and medium en­ter­prises and a fur­ther $5bn con­tri­bu­tion to the China Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund.

China is Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, with trade be­tween the two sides ex­ceed­ing $220bn last year, but trade is skewed in China’s favour and there are hopes that the fi­nan­cial in­jec­tion will also ad­dress the im­bal­ance. Mar­tyn Davies, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Emerg­ing Mar­kets &amp; Africa at Deloitte’s Fron­tier Ad­vi­sory, said yes­ter­day that the R860bn pack­age was in­dica­tive of China’s state cap­i­tal­ist ap­proach to­ward the con­ti­nent, but African states could have been more proac­tive to­ward ne­go­ti­at­ing their own mar­ket en­tries into the Chi­nese econ­omy. Out­sourced “It ap­pears that many African gov­ern­ments have seem­ingly out­sourced their eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to Beijing.

za,The Sunday Independent,20151129,Learn­ing from China is crit­i­cal for Africa’s suc­cess,"AFRICA has had 15 years to learn the lessons of China’s spec­tac­u­lar eco­nomic suc­cess through its as­so­ci­a­tion with Beijing in the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Focac), but has it? Focac will hold its sixth, three-yearly, high-level meet­ing in Sand­ton this week. It will be the sec­ond at sum­mit level and the first in Africa. At first glance, Focac may seem to favour China, if only be­cause China has been so much more suc­cess­ful than any African coun­try. But in fact it has been an en­deav­our by the African side to coun­ter­bal­ance China’s suc­cess. Be­fore Focac, China had al­ready be­gun a ma­jor drive into the con­ti­nent in search of raw ma­te­ri­als. The gen­eral pat­tern of the eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship was large ex­ports from Africa of raw ma­te­ri­als and large im­ports by them of Chi­nese man­u­fac­tured goods. So, one of the main aims of the Africans – par­tic­u­larly South Africa – in Focac has been to try to re­bal­ance that un­bal­anced eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship, for in­stance, by en­cour­ag­ing Chi­nese in­vest­ment in pro­duc­tion that adds val- struc­ture that sup­ports the AU’s re­gional in­te­gra­tion am­bi­tions, rather than into na­tional projects. But apart from try­ing to shape China’s Africa pol­icy, it should be keen to learn from a coun­try that has ex­pe­ri­enced a 40-fold in­crease in its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and lifted 500 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty in just 35 years. This is cer­tainly the time to be learn­ing be­cause the com­mod­ity boom that boosted China’s im­port of African raw ma­te­ri­als and the con­ti­nent’s av­er­age growth rate this cen­tury to about 5 per­cent is end­ing. How Africa should re­late to the new Chi­nese model of do­mes­tic con­sumerled growth, rather than highly in­dus­tri­alised, ex­port-led growth, will be a hot topic at the sum­mit. Ul­ti­mately, Africa’s sal­va­tion lies in em­u­lat­ing China’s suc­cess. Luke Jor­dan, an an­a­lyst with Grass­root, gave a sem­i­nar at the South African In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs last week, and of­fered sug­ges­tions on how to do this. Chi­nese cul­ture has also been cited as a fac­tor in the suc­cess story and this may have some bear­ing on what Jor­dan sug­gests is the main rea­son for Beijing’s eco­nomic mir­a­cle. He noted that a de­tailed anal­y­sis of China’s poli­cies and pro­grammes re­vealed that many had only been partly suc­cess­ful or not suc­cess­ful at all at first. But then the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment had changed or adapted them un­til they worked. “This sug­gests the pri­mary cause of China’s de­vel­op­ment may not lie in any set of static poli­cies, but in the dy­namic process of state learn­ing that con­tin­u­ously ad­justs them.” He de­scribed how China had in­sti­tu­tion­alised the process of learn­ing from its mis­takes, con­stantly mon­i­tor­ing the re­sults of past poli­cies through a net­work of na­tional and provin­cial think tanks and gov­ern­ment re­search units. As an ex­am­ple, Jor­dan cites the spe­cial eco­nomic zones, (SEZs) which have of­ten been cred­ited with much of China’s suc­cess. He notes China has con­stantly adapted th­ese to chang­ing re­al­i­ties and al­lowed con­sid­er­able lee­way for lo­cal of­fi­cials to im­ple­ment poli­cies that are ap­pro­pri­ate to their SEZs. He con­trasts this flex­i­ble ap­proach to both the SEZ poli­cies of In­dia and South Africa, both of which are far more rigid, less adapt­able to lo­cal con­di­tions and not in­te­grated into the nor­mal en­vi­ron­ment. As a re­sult, In­dian SEZs have mostly been aban­doned. The South African ones, he seems to be suggest­ing, could be head­ing the same way. Jor­dan sees a sim­i­lar prag­ma­tism and adapt­abil­ity in ru­ral de­vel­op­ment and in­fra­struc­ture build. So he sug­gests, rather wryly, that for Africans to try to im­port fixed Chi­nese poli­cies to im­ple­ment in Africa is as prob­lem­atic as im­port­ing Chi­nese man­u­fac­tured goods, rather than build­ing their own pro­duc­tive ca­pac­i­ties. In­stead he pro­poses Africa, through Focac and oth­er­wise – should mount a com­pre­hen­sive pro­gramme of study­ing in de­tail the ways in which prag­matic China has adapted its poli­cies to the de­mands of chang­ing re­al­ity. The great irony of this is that China’s suc­cess has largely been at­trib­uted to top-down com­man­dist ap­proach. But it is the fil­ter­ing up of the re­sults of im­ple­ment­ing its poli­cies that has ev­i­dently been more crit­i­cal.",南非
za,Cape Argus,20111207,Rad­i­cal re­think a must for cash flow,"DOREEN Ni­cholas (not her real name) is a mother of three chil­dren aged 13, 10 and four. Doreen, 34, is mar­ried and her hus­band has a rea­son­able job at an en­ter­prise that man­u­fac­tures baby foods. She is a vi­brant and car­ing mother, and wants her chil­dren to have a good ed­u­ca­tion. Doreen passed the old Stan­dard 8 (Grade 10) and un­der­stands the lim­i­ta­tions of leav­ing school early be­cause of an un­wanted teenage preg­nancy. Doreen wants a job. She has taught her­self ba­sic ac­coun­tancy and can keep books. She needs to earn more money to put her chil­dren through school. Liv­ing in Mitchells Plain, Doreen wants to start her own small busi­ness so that she can be home for her chil­dren, but she needs start-up cap­i­tal. Where does she get the R20 000 to start a cloth­ing re­pair busi­ness? The Ni­cholas fam­ily live in a small home, but they can­not bor­row money against it. Why? It is an RDP house and they do not have le­gal ti­tle. They also can­not rent it out, or sell it on. Their house is dead eq­uity. One of the crit­i­cal points we make in the 8 per­cent Growth Pol­icy Project is that one of the key bar­ri­ers lim­it­ing the abil­ity of mil­lions of poor South Africans to par­tic­i­pate in the for­mal econ­omy is their lack of ac­cess to cap­i­tal. With­out the abil­ity to take out a bond, or a busi­ness or ed­u­ca­tional loan, it is very dif­fi­cult for poor house­holds to do things such as de­velop in­for­mal busi­nesses into for­mal enterprises, gain additional skills or make in­vest­ments in key in­puts. This prob­lem was iden­ti­fied in Peru­vian econ­o­mist Her­nando de Soto’s sem­i­nal book The Mys­tery of Cap­i­tal, where he ar­gues that un­der­ly­ing poverty and un­der­de­vel­op­ment is the lack of well-de­fined prop­erty rights. In SA to­day many in­for­mal en­trepreneurs, who gen­er­ally lack for­mal as­set own­er­ship, can­not ob­tain credit, sell their en­ter­prise for a profit, or ex­pand. More­over, they can­not seek le­gal reme­dies to busi­ness con­flicts through the courts. In many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries even the poor­est mem­bers of so­ci­ety live in hous­ing pro­vided by the state or on farm­land that is held in trust, or make com­mer­cial use of tra­di­tional knowl­edge sys­tems. These “as­sets”, which De Soto es­ti­mates to be worth more than $10 tril­lion glob­ally, are, how­ever, “frozen” be­cause they can­not be sold, traded against, or used as col­lat­eral for loans. They are there­fore, in his words, a form of dead cap­i­tal. The DA be­lieves creative pol­icy pro­pos­als are needed to “cap­i­talise the poor”. This could be achieved by, for ex­am­ple, trans­fer­ring state-owned and cus­tom­ary land to poor house­holds and by dis­tribut­ing shares in state-owned enterprises through broad-based em­pow­er­ment schemes. The fact is that we need eco­nomic free­dom, the free­dom to be an en­tre­pre­neur and make a buck fairly. We need thou­sands of small en­trepreneurs in re­tail and ser­vices. Only then will we see op­por­tu­ni­ties emerge that al­low thou­sands of South Africans to rise up from poverty. It is well known that SA is one of the most un­equal so­ci­eties in the world. Ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tre for De­vel­op­ment and En­ter­prise, in 2008 the av­er­age in­come of the rich­est 10 per­cent of house­holds was nearly 40 times more than the av­er­age in­come of the poor­est 50 per­cent. In­cred­i­bly, the av­er­age in­come of the rich­est 10 per­cent of house­holds was nearly 150 times that of the poor­est 10 per­cent. De­spite dra­matic in­creases in so­cial spend­ing – the num­ber of peo­ple re­ceiv­ing so­cial grants, for in­stance, has in­creased sub­stan­tially over the years, from 2.5 mil­lion in 1999 to 15 mil­lion this year – and the in­tro­duc­tion of new laws aimed at re­dis­tribut­ing in­comes and op­por­tu­ni­ties, in­equal­ity has per­sisted in South Africa and may even be worse to­day than it was at the tran­si­tion to democ­racy in 1994. Why is this? The first thing to note is that poverty and in­equal­ity are not the same thing. The poverty rate in a coun­try is usu­ally mea­sured as the pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion liv­ing be­low a given in­come level, which for ex­treme poverty is usu­ally mea­sured as $1 per per­son per day. In­equal­ity on the other hand has to do with the dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth in so­ci­ety be­tween the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’. In­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence has shown that the only sus­tain­able way to tackle poverty is through high rates of job-cre­at­ing eco­nomic growth. While lift­ing peo­ple out of poverty by in­creas­ing the ab­so­lute num­ber of peo­ple in em­ploy­ment, high growth also gen­er­ates new wealth that, through ap­pro­pri­ate tax­a­tion, can be ploughed into bet­ter ser­vices for the poor. How­ever, high growth can also in­crease in­equal­ity, at least in the short term, be­cause some peo­ple are bet­ter placed than oth­ers to make the most of new op­por­tu­ni­ties. This is the case in China where the num­ber of mil­lion­aires is in­creas­ing faster than any­where else in the world at the same time as mil­lions of peo­ple are lifted out of poverty as a con­se­quence of rapid job cre­ation. When think­ing about how to ad­dress eco­nomic in­equal­ity on the other hand, it is im­por­tant to recog­nise that SA is al­ready one of the most re­dis­tribu­tive coun­tries in the world. This is best il­lus­trated by us­ing the ex­am­ple of the tax sys­tem: whereas only 5.9 mil­lion South Africans pay in­come tax, about 15 mil­lion re­ceive some form of wel­fare grant from the state. The sit­u­a­tion is clearly un­sus­tain­able and there is not much more the state can do to ac­tively in­ter­vene to re­dis­tribute wealth – say, by in­creas­ing taxes even fur­ther – with­out hav­ing ad­verse ef­fects on eco­nomic growth, which in turn lim­its job cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. SA needs to adopt a longterm ap­proach to deal­ing with in­equal­ity, one that main­tains our pro­gres­sive tax­a­tion sys­tem, but that com­ple­ments it with a rad­i­cally im­proved ed­u­ca­tion strat­egy to en­sure that more peo­ple from pre­vi­ously dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds en­ter higher-paid work, and a new ap­proach to “cap­i­talise” the poor.

za,Pretoria News,20100224,China is test­ing if there is a thing as too much stim­u­lus,"THE TOWN­SHIP of Huaxi in the Yangtze River Delta is a proud sym­bol of how Chi­nese com­mu­nists em­braced cap­i­tal­ism to lift 300 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty dur­ing the past three decades. Its leaders took a farm com­mu­nity with bam­boo huts and ox carts in the 1970s and trans­formed it into an in­dus­trial and com­mer­cial pow­er­house, where to­day many of its 30 000 res­i­dents live in man­sions and most have a car. Per capita in­come of 80 000 yuan (R90 160) – al­most four times the na­tional av­er­age – al­lows Huaxi to claim it is China’s rich­est vil­lage. Huaxi is also em­blem­atic of the coun­try’s construction and prop­erty boom. Com­mu­nist Party of­fi­cials there are build­ing one of the world’s 30 tallest build­ings, a 2.5 bil­lion yuan, 328m tower. The re­volv­ing restau­rant atop the so-called New Vil­lage in the Sky of­fers sweep­ing views of paddy fields, fish ponds and or­chards. Marc Faber, the pub­lisher of the Gloom, Boom &amp; Doom Re­port, said China was over­do­ing it. “It does not make sense for China to build more empty build­ings and add to ca­pac­i­ties in in­dus­tries where you al­ready have over­ca­pac­ity,” ac­cord­ing to Faber. “I think the econ­omy will de­cel­er­ate very sub­stan­tially in 2010 and could even crash,” added Faber. Huaxi has an even more am­bi­tious project com­ing up: a 6 bil­lion yuan, 538m sky­scraper that would rank as the world’s tallest af­ter Dubai’s new Burj Khal­ifa. Such un­der­tak­ings fig­ured in warn­ings that Jim Chanos, the pres­i­dent of Kynikos As­so­ci­ates, made last month that China is Dubai times a thou­sand. The costs of waste­ful in­vest­ments in empty offices and shop­ping malls and in un­der­utilised in­fra­struc­ture would weigh on China, Chanos said. “We may find that that is what pops the Chi­nese bub­ble sooner rather than later.” China has de­fied the global re­ces­sion of the past two years and re­mained the fastest grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct soared 10.7 per­cent in the fourth quar­ter of last year. The gov­ern­ment has pro­vided 4 tril­lion yuan in stimu- lus spending and en­cour­aged banks to lend a record 9.59 tril­lion yuan last year, try­ing to bridge the gap un­til de­mand for ex­ports re­bounds. Last month, the coun­try’s bank­ing groups lent a fur­ther 1.39 tril­lion yuan – al­most one-fifth of the tar­get amount for the whole of this year. Also last month, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment climbed 7.8 per­cent to $8.13bn (R62.5bn). Re­tail sales dur­ing last week’s Lu­nar New Year hol­i­day rose 17.2 per­cent from the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Com­merce. While China’s re­silience has helped sup­port the world econ­omy, rais­ing de­mand for en­ergy and raw ma­te­ri­als, the burst­ing of a bub­ble would have the op­po­site ef­fect. Gov­ern­ment ef­forts to wean the econ­omy off its ex­traor­di­nary sup­port may roil mar­kets. Last month, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment or­dered banks to curb lend­ing, which put China’s stock mar­ket into re­verse. In a sign, in part, of how de­pen­dent the world has be­come on China, stocks and cur­ren­cies slumped in places such as Aus­tralia and Brazil that sup­ply com­modi­ties to China. On Fe­bru­ary 12, China for the sec­ond time in a month or­dered banks to set aside more de­posits as re­serves. The Shang­hai Com­pos­ite in­dex has fallen 8 per­cent year-to-date, af­ter gain­ing 80 per­cent last year. “If the Chi­nese econ­omy de­cel­er­ates or crashes, what you have is a dis­as­trous en­vi­ron­ment for in­dus­trial com­modi­ties,” said Faber. – Bloomberg",南非

Obama was speak­ing af­ter talks with Prime Min­is­ter Haile­mariam De­salegn dur­ing the first trip by a serv­ing US pres­i­dent to Ethiopia, one of Africa’s fastest-grow­ing economies but which has of­ten been crit­i­cised for its hu­man rights record. The op­po­si­tion failed to se­cure a sin­gle seat in a par­lia­men­tary elec­tion in May, and the US has crit­i­cised Ethiopia’s de­ten­tion of blog­gers and jour­nal­ists in the past. The gov­ern­ment in­sists those de­tained have com­mit­ted crimes. “The gov­ern­ing party has sig­nif­i­cant breadth and pop­u­lar­ity and, as a con­se­quence, mak­ing sure to open ad­di­tional space for jour­nal­ists or media or op­po­si­tion voices will strengthen, rather than in­hibit, the agenda that the prime min­is­ter and the rul­ing party have put for­ward,” Obama said. Haile­mariam, speak­ing at the same brief­ing, ac­knowl­edged his coun­try was a “young democ­racy” that had more to do, but also said he had “mi­nor dif­fer­ences” with the US about the speed of that process. Ethiopia, run by Haile­mariam’s rul­ing party for a quar­ter of a cen­tury, is on track for 10% growth this year, help­ing trans­form a coun­try that was brought to its knees by com­mu­nist purges in the 1970s and famine in the 1980s. Obama praised Ethiopia’s de­vel­op­ment record that had pulled “mil­lions of peo­ple” out of poverty in the past 15 years in the coun­try of 96 mil­lion, although he said there were “still too many peo­ple” who were strug­gling. “My mes­sage to the peo­ple of Ethiopia is: as you take steps mov­ing your coun­try for­ward, the US will be stand­ing by you the en­tire way,” he said. Obama dis­cussed closer se­cu­rity co-op­er­a­tion with Ethiopia, and praised its role in an African force in So­ma­lia that was help­ing shrink the area con­trolled by al-Shabaab mil­i­tants. Obama’s Africa tour, which be­gan on Fri­day in his fa­ther’s home­land Kenya, also aims to boost trade and busi­ness ties with a con­ti­nent where China over­took the US as the big­gest trade part­ner in 2009. The Ethiopian prime min­is­ter noted a cen­tury of diplo­matic ties with the US, but said the US “in­vest­ment flow doesn’t match”. He said that Amer­ica was a leader in science and tech­nol­ogy, which Africa needed more of. Ethiopia’s break­neck eco­nomic growth has been driven largely by state-led in­vest­ment, which econ­o­mists said was squeez­ing out pri­vate busi­ness. Haile­mariam said the coun­try had to do more to re­move bu­reau­cracy and bot­tle­necks to avoid de­ter­ring in­vestors.

za,Sunday Times,20140720,Brics na­tions form their own mini IMF,"THE for­ma­tion of the New De­vel­op­ment Bank (NDB) by the five Brics coun­tries — Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa — will help these na­tions pur­sue their am­bi­tions. Jeremy Stevens, Stan­dard Bank’s re­search an­a­lyst based in China, said the ini­tia­tive would help South Africa and Brazil push re­gional trade, in­vest­ment and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, do­mes­tic job cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. It would aid China in broad­en­ing the mar­ket for its cur­rency, get higher re­turns on its re­serves and de-politi­cise that coun­try’s in­vest­ments. In­dia and Brazil could use the bank as a promis­ing source of funds for their siz­able in­fra­struc­ture needs. Rus­sia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion aided its am­bi­tion to tie it­self to the next gen­er­a­tion of eco­nomic heavy­weights. This week, the long-awaited Brics bank, which will be based in Shang­hai, was es­tab­lished two years af­ter the idea was mooted in New Delhi, In­dia. The NDB re­flects how frus­trated these in­creas­ing in­flu­en­tial emerg­ing coun­tries are with Western in­sti­tu­tions such as the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF). Brazil­ian pres­i­dent Dilma Rouss­eff said: “It is a sign of the times, which de­mands re­form of the IMF.” The NDB is the first mul­ti­lat­eral bank to be based in China, a coun­try which, along with Rus­sia, has not been shy to tell Western na­tions, par­tic­u­larly the US where to jump. China is set to over­take the US as the world’s largest econ­omy sooner than ex­pected. In­dia is on course to be­come the third­biggest econ­omy by 2020. Re­nais­sance Cap­i­tal’s global chief econ­o­mist, Charles Robertson, said that if an Amer­i­can kept head­ing the World Bank and a Euro­pean the IMF then coun­tries such as China would even­tu­ally keep cre­at­ing in­sti­tu­tions to chal­lenge them. The group also launched a $100-bil­lion con­tin­gency re­serve ar­range­ment, which mem­ber states can tap into in the case of bal­ance of pay­ment crises. The NDB may be a step for­ward for Brics, but the in­sti­tu­tion’s prac­ti­cal­ity is un­der scru­tiny. The $10-bil­lion bank, de­rived from economies with a GDP of about $15.8-tril­lion, will not be sig­nif­i­cant for many years to come, Robertson says. Stevens ex­pects the new bank to lend about $30-bil­lion a year over the next five years. This is dwarfed by the $61bil­lion the World Bank, es­tab­lished in 1944, ex­pects to lend this year. “It is pri­mar­ily a way for coun­tries with low sav­ings to tap the high sav­ings of China. The World Bank faces no t hreat from this,” said Robertson. Po­lit­i­cal Fu­tures Con­sul­tancy di­rec­tor Daniel Silke echoed these sen­ti­ments, but said the bank may cre­ate com­pe­ti­tion for ex­ist­ing de­vel­op­ment banks. Silke said that the NDB would have to tackle is­sues sim­i­lar to those faced by the World Bank and the IMF. Fi­nance Min­is­ter Nh­lanhla Nene said: “What is unique about this bank is that it is es­tab­lished by de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, which un­der­stand de­vel­op­ment chal­lenges and have demon­strated their abil­ity to tackle such chal­lenges.”",南非
za,The Mercury,20100111,Burger in­dex adds meat to cur­rency com­par­isons,"IN 1986, jour­nal­ists writ­ing for The Econ­o­mist de­vised a novel guide to help de­ter­mine whether cur­ren­cies are at their “cor­rect” level. They based this guide on a stan­dard­ised prod­uct avail­able in more than 100 coun­tries – the McDon­ald’s Big Mac burger. They chose the Big Mac be­cause it is a highly uni­form prod­uct avail­able ev­ery­where. What started as an in­ter­est­ing and light-hearted guide to cur­rency val­u­a­tion has since turned into the widely ac­claimed Big Mac In­dex (BMI). As The Econ­o­mist put it: “(The BMI) seeks to make ex­change rate the­ory a bit more di­gestible.” What’s in­ter­est­ing about the BMI is that it pro­vides a quick ref­er­ence as to what a cur­rency would buy in an­other coun­try. Since prices in poor coun­tries tend to be lower, for ex­am­ple, an Amer­i­can spending dol­lars in South Africa will get a lot more for his money than he would back home. This is true for the ma­jor­ity of non-trad­able goods and ser­vices in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. It is there­fore mis­lead­ing to con­vert South African wages into dol­lars at mar­ket ex­change rates. This holds some ma­jor im­pli­ca­tions for the way in which we view the growth of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. For in­stance, con­vert­ing a de­vel­op­ing coun­try’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) into dol­lars at mar­ket ex­change rates will sig­nif­i­cantly un­der­state the true size of its econ­omy and its liv­ing stan­dards. But how do we know how much more a dol­lar will be worth in a coun­try like South Africa? For this we need a bet­ter method than sim­ply con­vert­ing out­puts at cur­rent ex­change rates. A bet­ter method, known as pur­chas­ing power par­ity (PPP), takes into ac­count price dif­fer­ences across economies. PPP tells us that al­though the size of your pay cheque is im­por­tant, its pur­chas­ing power is per­haps more so. For ex­am­ple, a Big Mac burger costs $3.57 in the US and R17.95 in South Africa. How­ever, at the cur­rent ex­change rate ($1=R7.39), a Big Mac should cost about $2.43 (R17.95/R7.39). Given that the Big Mac price in the US is $3.57, the im­plied PPP of the dol­lar is R5.03 (R17.95/$3.57). But the cur­rent ex­change rate is R7.39, sug­gest­ing the rand is un­der­val­ued by about 32 per­cent. If you do the same cal­cu­la­tions for most other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, you will find their cur­ren­cies are also un­der­val­ued. An in­ter­est­ing corol­lary to the BMI is how long it takes a worker to buy a Big Mac in their re­spec­tive cities. A re­port pro­duced by UBS en­ti­tled “Prices and Earn­ings” showed the world av­er­age is 37 min­utes in or­der to earn enough to pay for a Big Mac. How­ever, in Joburg it takes an av­er­age of 26 min­utes. In Chicago it takes 12 min­utes, in Bei­jing 44 min­utes, and in Nairobi it takes more than two hours. When con­verted at mar­ket ex­change rates, de­vel­op­ing coun­tries con­trib­ute rel­a­tively lit­tle to to­tal global out­put. Take China, for in­stance. Over the past 20-odd years, China has ex­pe­ri­enced sus­tained, rapid eco­nomic growth, with an av­er­age an­nual gross do­mes­tic growth rate in the 1990-2008 pe­riod of about 10 per­cent. When con­verted at mar­ket ex­change rates, China ranks sixth on the global eco­nomic rank­ings. How­ever, when con­verted us­ing the PPP method, China jumps to sec­ond place, ahead of Ger­many, the UK and France, and ac­counts for roughly 13 per­cent of world out­put. Neg­a­tive In­dia moves from 11th to fourth place, and Brazil, Rus­sia and South Korea are ahead of Canada. An­other ma­jor neg­a­tive im­pli­ca­tion of sim­ply con­vert­ing out­puts us­ing mar­ket ex­change rates is that in­equal­ity fig­ures are ex­ag­ger­ated. Us­ing mar­ket ex­change rates, the av­er­age Amer­i­can is 33 times richer than the av­er­age Chi­nese; but on a PPP ba- sis he is “only” seven times richer. This ap­par­ent mag­i­cal de­cline in in­equal­ity is not sur­pris­ing when one con­sid­ers China’s pop­u­la­tion liv­ing in ex­treme poverty (de­fined as liv­ing on less than a $1 a day) has de­creased by at least 150 mil­lion, ac­count­ing for 85 per­cent of the to­tal poverty re­duc­tion in the East Asian re­gion. The BMI pro­vides an eas­ily di­gestible idea of what is hap­pen­ing on the ground in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. De­vel­op­ing coun­tries are not only grow­ing much faster than rich coun­tries, they are also de­mand­ing an in­creas­ing quan­tity of re­sources in or­der to do so.

za,Pretoria News,20150615,Africa needs to fol­low in China’s foot­steps to achieve higher rates,"WHEN you are look­ing over the beau­ti­ful At­lantic Ocean from the har­bour in Cape Town, host city of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum on Africa 2015, it is easy to con­vince your­self that Africa’s longterm out­look is pos­i­tive. A num­ber of fac­tors are pulling it in the right di­rec­tion. The top 10 per­form­ing African coun­tries have a com­bined growth rate that av­er­aged 7.6 per­cent over the past decade. Nige­ria, Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Mozam­bique, An­gola and Zam­bia also have a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of around 700 mil­lion peo­ple. Even over the past five years, hardly a be­nign en­vi­ron­ment, growth has been 6.6 per­cent. Th­ese stats are im­pres­sive. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that pop­u­la­tion growth has been around 2.5 per­cent year on year, which means that per capita growth has been run­ning at around 5 per­cent. A 5 per­cent rate of growth means that gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) per capita will more than dou­ble in the next 20 years and that in 30 years, GDP in th­ese coun­tries will be where Morocco and Ja­maica are to­day; in 40 years they will reach the same level as In­done­sia in 2014. There will be progress, but not a rapid Asian-es­que trans­for­ma­tion. If Africa’s top 10 were able to match Asia’s growth rate – closer to 7 per­cent GDP per capita (im­ply­ing a 10 per­cent year-on-year GDP growth rate for the next decade be­fore pop­u­la­tion growth be­gins to de­cel­er­ate) – then they would be able to turn them­selves into Colom­bia and Thai­land in 30 years and to Es­to­nia and the Czech Repub­lic in 40. Africa is grow­ing fast, much faster than it did in the 1980s or 1990s, but the growth rate has to ac­cel­er­ate to de­liver what China and the south-east Asian tigers have done. Africa needs to find a road that leads to the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. Chang­ing growth mod­els With the fall in com­mod­ity prices, the ques­tion of how to boost growth is back at the top of the agenda. But there are rea­sons to be bear­ish on a quick re­cov­ery in the com­modi­ties mar­ket. China is chang­ing its growth model and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set the coun­try on a more sus­tain­able course. Mean­while, other fast-grow­ing Asian na­tions like In­dia, In­done­sia, Bangladesh and the Philip­pines will not be as re­source­hun­gry as China be­cause the sub­si­dies for in­ten­sive con­sump­tion in a man­u­fac­tur­ing­driven growth model are not there. They will con­sume nat­u­ral re­sources, but not at the same pace or rate as China. This puts the brakes on Africa’s com­mod­ity-driven turbo growth, which is a chal­lenge. But I still think it’s pos­si­ble to in­crease growth to Asian lev­els. This will de­pend to a larger de­gree on the abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to im­ple­ment struc­tural re­forms. The road to 10 per­cent growth must be forged within Africa. Op­por­tu­nity to re­form To many, the elec­tion re­sult in Nige­ria came as a sur­prise. But from an­other per­spec­tive, the change of gov­ern­ment from Good­luck Jonathan to Muham­madu Buhari was a sign that Africa is ma­tur­ing. When peo­ple are si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­com­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated and more ur­banised, while in­for­ma­tion flows more freely and hu­man rights is­sues are at the fore­front, it is nat­u­ral that there will be more regular tran­si­tions be­tween gov­ern­ments. You can hardly hold Jonathan re­spon­si­ble for the col­lapse of the oil price, but Nige­ria could have done more to build buf­fers against the var­i­ous crises fac­ing the coun­try. The con­flict with Boko Haram has es­ca­lated in the north, im­port prices have been pushed up by the de­pre­ci­a­tion of the naira, cor­rup­tion is high and poverty re­duc­tion has been slower than in other coun­tries. It could be ar­gued that the best thing for Nige­ria now would be if Jonathan joins for­mer pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo as a re­spected leader in a peer role. Mean­while, if Buhari can as­sume the role of eco­nomic re­former, then this will be a game-changer. Low oil prices can be seen as an op­por­tu­nity to re­form en­ergy sub­si­dies, as Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has done in In­done­sia, to strengthen public fi­nances. The fact that naira has de­pre­ci­ated heav­ily could be used as an op­por­tu­nity to open up and di­ver­sify the econ­omy. Nige­rian in­dus­try must be much more com­pet­i­tive so tar­iffs and a myr­iad of bar­ri­ers to trade can be dis­man­tled. The weak cur­rency could also boost prof­itabil­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and be­come a build­ing block for more in­clu­sive growth that does a bet­ter job of re­duc­ing poverty. A sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards the 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety is to end ‘win­ner-takes-all’ democ­racy and the con­cept of an ‘our turn to eat’ po­lit­i­cal sys­tem. If this can be­come the norm, then Africa will take a huge step to­wards reach­ing 10 per­cent growth. There have been con­cerns about China’s in­creas­ing role in Africa. Let me take the op­po­site po­si­tion. China’s econ­omy grew by 10 per­cent year on year for four decades, and the coun­try achieved the fastest trans­for­ma­tion from poverty to pros­per­ity. Africa needs to be­come more Chi­nese. Here are four rea­sons why: China let mar­ket forces work in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. The house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem – which gave house­holds rel­a­tive au­ton­omy over land and crops – and sub­se­quent re­forms led to 15 per­cent an­nual growth in agri­cul­ture over the years that fol­lowed. When the same hap­pens in Africa, with the dereg­u­la­tion of cof­fee in Rwanda an ex­am­ple, the re­sults will come. China did its best to pro­tect com­pet­i­tive­ness by push­ing its cur­rency to an ar­ti­fi­cially low level. A weak cur­rency is of­ten good for farm­ers who ex­port their pro­duce but prob­lem­atic for im­porters in ur­ban ar­eas. Some­times, for ex­am­ple, if a gov­ern­ment is wor­ried about po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in its ur­ban ar­eas, a strong cur­rency to sub­sidise food im­ports seems log­i­cal, although it does hurt the ma­jor­ity of farm­ers. But an ar­ti­fi­cially weak cur­rency – even if it might up­set the US and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) – is es­sen­tial for an ex­port-led growth model and only ex­port ori­en­ta­tion can bring about 10 per­cent growth. African cur­ren­cies are now weak. Keep them weak and use this as an op­por­tu­nity to carry out struc­tural re­forms and re­move bar­ri­ers to trade. China has forced up its sav­ings rate. It peaked at 50 per­cent be­fore the cri­sis and in the mid-1990s it hov­ered around 40 per­cent. To some ex­tent this has been a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of a weak ex­change rate, low in­ter­est rates and fi­nan­cial re­pres­sion. With high sav­ings rates it’s also pos­si­ble to mo­bilise the nec­es­sary do­mes­tic cap­i­tal to sus­tain high in­vest­ment rates. Sav­ings rates in the Asian growth mir­a­cle coun­tries have in gen­eral been high and in­vest­ment lev­els are of­ten be­tween 30 per­cent to 40 per­cent of GDP. No coun­try has grown for a sus­tained pe­riod with­out in­vest­ment above 30 per­cent of GDP, but the sav­ings rate in Africa is more of­ten close to 20 per­cent. Of course, high in­vest­ment brings with it a risk of large cur­rent ac­count deficits and the dan­ger that a coun­try could run into a bal­ance of pay­ments cri­sis. High do­mes­tic sav­ings counter that risk. An es­sen­tial fea­ture of the Chi­nese road to 10 per­cent growth is open­ness to tech­nol­ogy. Tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions are slow and costly. The good news, how­ever, is that you don’t need to in­no­vate; you can just copy at very low cost. This is the Silk Road to a 10 per­cent growth so­ci­ety. It’s pos­si­ble for Africa’s top 10 coun­tries to move in this di­rec­tion, but there are ma­jor ob­sta­cles to over­come. The macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment has re­cently taken a more chal­leng­ing turn. The cur­rency tur­moil that will prob­a­bly fol­low the Fed­eral Re­serve’s de­ci­sion to in­crease rates will also af­fect Africa.",南非

“","AFRICA’S lead­ing pres­i­dents, in­clud­ing the con­tro­ver­sial Uhuru Keny­atta of Kenya and Robert Mu­gabe of Zim­babwe, have re­jected any bid to cast China’s pres­ence in Africa as a new colo­nial era. The pres­i­dents took turns talk­ing to Chi­nese Tele­vi­sion CCTV in a rare dis­play of open­ness to ad­dress Chi­nese au­di­ences to wel­come the $60 bil­lion (about R860bn) in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment aid pledged by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping this week. Ac­cord­ing to the World Bank, Africa has seven of the fastest­grow­ing economies and, with the world eco­nomic slump, China is look­ing for new mar­kets to in­vest in as its own eco­nomic growth has been one of the big­gest in the past sev­eral decades. Pres­i­dent Xi stressed at the open­ing of Focac that the frame­work in which China was part­ner­ing with Africa was one of mu­tual ben­e­fits and equal re­la­tions. Mu­gabe didn’t dis­ap­point as he re­minded Chi­nese au­di­ences of what the con­ti­nent had gone through un­der the Euro­pean colo­nial era. Mu­gabe said China was bring­ing to Africa the tech­nol­ogy, ex­pe­ri­ence and cap­i­tal to ac­cel­er­ate the con­ti­nent’s de­vel­op­ment. “We want to de­velop our­selves and free our­selves from the shack­les of colo­nial­ism,” he said. “Our colo­nial mas­ters are still in con­trol of our nat­u­ral re­sources. We have al­lowed them to be­come our eco­nomic mas­ters.” He said many of the com­pa­nies that were still in con­trol of Africa’s nat­u­ral re­sources were “blood suck­ers that must now get out of Africa and al­low it to pros­per”. Mu­gabe said China had worked with Africans for years and helped the con­ti­nent through­out the lib­er­a­tion strug­gles with­out ask­ing for some­thing in re­turn. He said Zim­babwe was proud to have now ad­vanced the own­er­ship of its nat­u­ral re­sources. “We now have a com­bi­na­tion of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy, ex­pe­ri­ence and fund­ing to add to our de­vel­op­ment and nat­u­ral re­sources,” he said. “We don’t need stupid (Western) NGOs who are still try­ing to con­trol us. They con­trol our elec­tions and they even de­cide that Mu­gabe has been in power for so long and he must give a chance to oth­ers. They think they have a right to su­per­vise peo­ple in our coun­tries.” Mu­gabe said China had demon­strated a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment, un­like Euro­peans who were still plun­der­ing Africa’s re­sources, in­clud­ing oil and gold. Keny­atta dis­pelled as a “mis­con­cep­tion” the crit­i­cism by some that China was look­ing to take con­trol of Africa’s nat­u­ral re­sources and its pres­ence in the con­ti­nent was a new colo­nial­ism. “They (Chi­nese) are not im­pos­ing on us what they want. They are ask­ing us how they can help us,” he said. “There is big wrong im­pres­sion that is be­ing put out there con­sis­tently about China. What stood out for me in this sum­mit is that there is a way of mov­ing Africa out of the shack­les of poverty.” Keny­atta en­cour­aged Chi­nese busi­nesses to con­tinue to sup­port and in­vest in the con­ti­nent. He said the beauty of Xi’s 10-point plan for Africa was that it recog­nised that “you can’t in­dus­tri­alise un­less you have ex­pe­ri­ence and train­ing”. Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Rob Davies has em­pha­sised the need to es­tab­lish a new eco­nomic growth tra­jec­tory that moves away from the trad­ing of pri­mary com­modi­ties to­wards the ex­port­ing of value-added prod­ucts with China. He said South African firms should ex­pect an in­creased flow of for­eign direct in­vest­ment into the con­ti­nent as well as di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion away from the cur­rent com­mod­i­ty­based com­po­si­tion.

za,The Citizen (KZN),20160903,Free trade on G20 agenda,"– Wedged in be­tween the Brexit vote and the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, lead­ers of the world’s ma­jor economies meet this week­end in China need­ing to mount a re­al­is­tic de­fence of the free trade and glob­al­i­sa­tion they have long cham­pi­oned. At stake is the post-World War ll concord on glob­al­i­sa­tion that pro­po­nents say has helped lift so much of the world out of poverty. China, the host of the Group of 20 meet­ing, has it­self been one of the big­gest win­ners from free trade, be­com­ing the world’s lead­ing ex­porter. But Bri­tain’s shock vote in June to leave the EU and the rise of pro­tec­tion­ist Don­ald Trump in the United States has shaken that ac­cord ahead of the G20 sum­mit in Hangzhou that starts to­mor­row. “This meet­ing – the first since Brexit and the US pres­i­den­tial pri­maries – should send a clear mes­sage that world lead­ers have heard peo­ple’s con­cerns about glob­al­i­sa­tion and are tak­ing steps to bet­ter un­der­stand and ad­dress them,” said as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor Mark Me­latos at the Uni­ver­sity of Syd­ney. “The risk is that noth­ing much will be achieved,” he warned. “More plat­i­tudes about the ben­e­fits of global trade and in­vest­ment will ring hol­low.” While there have been re­cent con­ces­sions that not ev­ery­one wins out of glob­al­i­sa­tion – US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Jack Lew this week spoke of anx­ious and an­gry peo­ple who felt left be­hind – the White House has also sig­nalled a re­newed push on the con­tro­ver­sial Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal as Pres­i­dent Barack Obama’s term winds down. The G20 earned its spurs with a con­certed re­ac­tion to the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, but re­cently op­po­si­tion to free trade seems to have gained pur­chase and a co­her­ent de­fence has been sadly lack­ing. Among the big­gest stick­ing points is over­ca­pac­ity in the global steel industry, a sore point for China as the world’s largest pro­ducer of the metal. Other con­cerns in­clude bar­ri­ers to for­eign in­vest­ment and the risk of cur­rency de­val­u­a­tions to pro­tect ex­port mar­kets. International Mone­tary Fund managing director Chris­tine La­garde said this week that G20 lead­ers needed to do far more to spur de­mand, bol­ster the case for trade and glob­al­i­sa­tion and fight in­equal­ity. –",南非

za,Daily News,20181213,Bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion bridges tra­di­tion,"EACH week, 68-year-old Huang Tian­heng trav­els 12km up­town to teach a group of chil­dren, wear­ing colour­ful tra­di­tional clothes to sing songs in Zhuang, a lan­guage used by China’s eth­nic mi­nor­ity Zhuang peo­ple. The choir at Qin­gle El­e­men­tary School, in Nan­ning, cap­i­tal of south­west China’s Guangxi Zhuang Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion, has toured across China, and some mem­bers have even per­formed in Paris. Zhuang peo­ple are one of the eth­nic mi­nori­ties with the largest pop­u­la­tion in China and most of them live in Guangxi, which has 11 na­tive eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups, with a to­tal pop­u­la­tion of 20 mil­lion. China has made ef­forts to pre­serve the lan­guages and tra­di­tions of eth­nic mi­nori­ties while achiev­ing de­vel­op­ment, by push­ing for bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion in the re­gion. Wum­ing District, where the el­e­men­tary school is lo­cated, is the birth­place of Zhuang cul­ture. Huang used to be the head of the lo­cal cul­ture cen­tre be­fore his re­tire­ment. Now, teach­ing lo­cal chil­dren Zhuang cul­ture has be­come his new job. At Qin­gle El­e­men­tary School, bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion started as early as the 1980s. A to­tal of 330 stu­dents in the school are be­ing taught in both lan­guages. Ef­forts to pre­serve the Zhuang lan­guage be­gan in 1952, when the State Coun­cil, China’s Cab­i­net, ap­proved a plan to pre­serve the lan­guage. In 1982, Guangxi re­leased a scheme for the Zhuang writ­ing sys­tem based on 26 Latin let­ters, bring­ing stan­dard­i­s­a­tion to the Zhuang writ­ten lan­guage. In Au­gust, the re­gion im­ple­mented reg­u­la­tions to in­crease Zhuang lan­guage us­age in pub­lic ar­eas and step up bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion and the train­ing of bilin­gual teach­ers. Apart from Zhuang, Guangxi has also opened bilin­gual cour­ses in el­e­men­tary and mid­dle school for Jing peo­ple, which has a pop­u­la­tion of around 20 000. “With these ef­forts, Jing’s eth­nic lan­guage has been bet­ter pre­served and more young peo­ple can speak and write in the lan­guage,” said Su Weifang, head of the Jing lan­guage and cul­tural in­her­i­tance cen­tre in the Guangxi city of Dongx­ing. Lo­cal statis­tics show that there are 269 bilin­gual schools in Guangxi,cover­ing al­most all Zhuang pop­u­lated coun­ties and pre­fec­tures, with more than 140 000 stu­dents. Many eth­nic mi­nori­ties are learn­ing Man­darin to get bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion and job op­por­tu­ni­ties. “Learn­ing Man­darin is like mas­ter­ing a skill to fight poverty,” said Pan Jifeng, a Yao woman who lives at a Yao vil­lage in the tourist city of Guilin. Her vil­lage re­ceives around 400 000 to 500 000 tourists each year and each house­hold is granted more than 10 000 yuan (R20 800) in div­i­dend from the ticket rev­enue alone. “Speak­ing Man­darin has helped boost lo­cal de­vel­op­ment. It works like a bridge to en­able com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween eth­nic mi­nori­ties and the out­side world,” said Huang. Lo­cal statis­tics re­veal 84% of the Guangxi pop­u­la­tion now speak Man­darin. “Bilin­gual ed­u­ca­tion can help stu­dents get in touch with mod­ern knowl­edge and in­herit their na­tive cul­ture,” said Wei Song­hao, a Zhuang lan­guage teacher at Qin­gle. | African News Agency (ANA)",南非

Im­por­tantly, as the two coun­tries agreed to co-op­er­a­tion to en­sure the pro­vi­sion of qual­ity education, the Vice-Pre­mier awarded 50 equip­ment pieces to be used in DUT’s lan­guage lab­o­ra­to­ries.

The CS Smelter Park will have a pri­vately-owned coal fired power sta­tion, which will be de­vel­oped in three phases of 300MW each. Buoyed by this in­vest­ment, Mchunu re­marked: “As the pro­vin­cial gov­ern­ment, we are ex­cited that Phase 1 of this project will at­tract for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment of about R39.1 bil­lion. “What is even more en­cour­ag­ing is that there is an es­ti­mated R30bn an­nual con­tri­bu­tion to­wards the prov­ince’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).

Obama praised Ethiopia’s de­vel­op­ment record that had pulled “mil­lions of peo­ple” out of poverty in the past 15 years in the na­tion of 96 mil­lion, but said there were “still too many peo­ple” strug­gling. “My mes­sage to the peo­ple of Ethiopia is: as you take steps mov­ing your coun­try for­ward, the US will be stand­ing by you the en­tire way,” he said. Obama dis­cussed closer se­cu­rity co-op­er­a­tion with Ethiopia, and praised its role in an African force in So­ma­lia that was help­ing shrink the area con­trolled by Is­lamist alShabaab mil­i­tants. Obama’s Africa tour, which be­gan on Fri­day in his fa­ther’s home­land Kenya, also aims to boost trade and busi­ness ties with a con­ti­nent where China over­took the US as the big­gest trade part­ner in 2009. The Ethiopian prime min­is­ter noted a cen­tury of diplo­matic ties with the United States but said the US “in­vest­ment flow doesn’t match”. He par­tic­u­larly noted that Amer­ica was a leader in science and tech­nol­ogy, which Africa needed more of. Ethiopia’s break­neck eco­nomic growth has been driven largely by state-led in­vest­ment, which econ­o­mists say is squeez­ing out pri­vate busi­ness. Haile­mariam said the coun­try had to do more to re­move bu­reau­cracy and bot­tle­necks to avoid de­ter­ring in­vestors. The gov­ern­ment has of­ten turned to China to help build new roads, rail­ways and dams in its bid to ex­pand the in­dus­trial base in the largely agrar­ian econ­omy. The new metro line that snakes through Ad­dis Ababa was built by a Chi­nese firm. See Page 12",南非

za,Cape Times,20190626,EXPO A UNIQUE OP­POR­TU­NITY FOR AFRICA,"AB­SORBED by the Ara­bian Gulf cri­sis last week, I missed a ma­jor way­point in South African mar­itime cel­e­bra­tion: the com­ple­tion of Cape Town’s Al­fred Basin 150 years ago. Imag­ine what it was like dis­charg­ing cargo into small boats and lighters in the open an­chor­age in Ta­ble Bay. Some car­goes were ex­tremely bulky and heavy and in­cluded parts for eight steam lo­co­mo­tives and rail­way lines for the rail­way from Cape Town to Welling­ton that was opened six years be­fore the com­ple­tion of Al­fred Basin. The need for a har­bour was un­der­lined fur­ther by fre­quent strand­ings on Wood­stock Beach and else­where around the bay. In­deed, while the Al­fred Basin was un­der con­struc­tion, the “Great Gale” of May 17, 1865, drove 19 ships ashore in one night. That new har­bour would have two main com­po­nents – a break­wa­ter and a dug-out basin. Con­struc­tion of the for­mer be­gan of­fi­cially in 1860 when Prince Al­fred, then a 16-year-old Royal Naval mid­ship­man, tipped a load of stone at the base of what be­came the break­wa­ter. The basin was dug by lo­cal con­victs and by some brought from other Bri­tish colonies. Life was tough for those mis­cre­ants who were housed in the Break­wa­ter Prison. With the wharves lined with hand­hewn stone dug from the basin and from the mas­sive quarry, the source of the stone for the break­wa­ter, Al­fred Basin was com­pleted on June 15, 1869, and, a month later, a cof­fer­dam was re­moved to al­low the sea to flood the dug-out basin. Much still had to be done to fin­ish the har­bour project, and only in May 1870 did the tug Gnu tow the brig Hai­ti­enne through The Cut to in­au­gu­rate the new Al­fred Basin. Six months later, Prince Al­fred, in the mean­time given the ti­tle Duke of Ed­in­burgh and pro­moted to cap­tain in the Royal Navy, of­fi­cially opened the Al­fred Basin and Robin­son Dry Dock. Also built at the time and shel­tered from the swell by the break­wa­ter was the Outer Basin whose sea­ward jetty be­came known as Num­ber One Jetty. In my ko­rt­broek days, the orig­i­nal wooden struc­ture was my happy hunt­ing ground for tug rides. Some years ago, the tim­ber jetty was re­placed by a con­crete struc­ture on which sev­eral build­ings were erected and it re­mains the berth for the port’s highly ma­noeu­vrable multi-direc­tional tugs, pi­lot boats and float­ing crane. Two ex­tra­ne­ous fac­tors in­flu­enced ship­ping. In the in­te­rior in 1867, the first known di­a­mond dis­cov­ery be­gan for­eign in­ter­est in the pos­si­bil­ity of great wealth hid­den in the ge­o­log­i­cal struc­tures and river beds of the North­ern Cape. How­ever, the for­tune re­alised by the sale of the so-called Star of South Africa in 1869 started a mas­sive di­a­mond rush that in­jected ur­gency to eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. From far and wide, thou­sands of for­tune seek­ers booked pas­sages to the Cape, cre­at­ing a lo­cal ship­ping boom as each ves­sel dis­em­barked new di­a­mond hun­ters. The in­creased de­mand at the di­a­mond fields for food, cloth­ing, con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als and min­ing equip­ment forced the rapid de­vel­op­ment of the rail­ways. By 1874, the rail­way line through moun­tain passes and across the veld linked Cape Town to Kim­ber­ley, a busy line that car­ried hun­dreds of pas­sen­gers and freight, mostly landed at the new Cape Town har­bour for the mines and for the set­tlers in the di­a­mond fields. Per­haps it was for­tu­nate that in Novem­ber 1869 – be­fore the Al­fred Basin was com­mis­sioned – the Suez Canal opened, tak­ing most of the ships mov­ing be­tween Europe and the East, in­clud­ing those on the Aus­tralasian trade. Yet the num­ber of ves­sels call­ing at the Cape in­creased, thanks to the di­a­mond rush, and, from 1888, the dis­cov­ery of gold that brought even more peo­ple and cargo, and there­fore ships. Older Dock­lan­ders may re­call coast­ers work­ing cargo in Al­fred Basin. For me, the basin held a dis­tinct fas­ci­na­tion in those ko­rt­broek years. I&J’s steam trawlers berthed her­ring-bone fash­ion, their bows to the quay. Those in­ward from the fishing grounds dis­charged fish in wicker bas­kets, laced with ice. Snoek boats were also in the basin. A high­light of my ram­bling around the basin was a steam tug as­sist­ing a freighter into the Robin­son Dry Dock, a tricky op­er­a­tion as trawlers at the North Quay usu­ally thwarted an easy ap­proach to the dry dock en­trance. Bas­ket-bear­ing work­ers car­ried coal aboard steam tugs and trawlers, tip­ping the coal from their bas­kets into the ves­sels’ bunkers. More gen­teel are the cur­rent ac­tiv­i­ties around the basin; from ho­tels and restau­rants, ex­otic aro­mas fill the air and ex­pen­sive leisure craft now line the cleaner wharves while the old quarry site now forms an ex­tended ma­rina. A swing bridge across The Cut de­nies folks a Penny Ferry ride. I liked the fishi­ness, the smoky at­mos­phere, and the true taste of salt of those ko­rt­broek years. And I en­joyed slap­tjips from the old Har­bour Café. BA­SIC premise: Eskom needs money, in large part be­cause mu­nic­i­pal debt to Eskom is very high. At present the gov­ern­ment bails out Eskom and it bails out fail­ing mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties. Prob­lem: there is not enough money. So­lu­tion: in­stead of the gov­ern­ment giv­ing bail-out loans to both Eskom and to mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties, it should give the loans to mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties, but ear­marked and se­cured for pay­ment di­rect to Eskom. That way the money works twice. And Eskom will have a bet­ter bal­ance sheet be­cause the money will be com­ing in as a pay­ment for elec­tric­ity de­liv­ered, not as a loan. So as long as the new brooms at Eskom don’t steal the money claim­ing it as a re­ward for se­cur­ing the cash in­fu­sion, this should work. CHINA will host the first Chi­naAfrica Eco­nomic and Trade Expo in Hu­nan prov­ince to­mor­row and on Fri­day. In ad­di­tion to more than 50 African coun­tries that have con­firmed their par­tic­i­pa­tion, a num­ber of in­ter­na­tional bodies such as the UN In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Or­gan­i­sa­tion, World Food Pro­gramme and the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion will send rep­re­sen­ta­tives. At least 1 000 Africans are ex­pected to at­tend the expo as in­vited guests or traders. This event is a fur­ther demon­stra­tion of the ever-grow­ing Sino-African re­la­tion­ship which tra­verses a gamut of is­sues, from his­tor­i­cal sim­i­lar­i­ties, po­lit­i­cal affin­ity and aneco­nomic re­liance to the re­cently deep­en­ing peo­ple-to-peo­ple re­la­tions. Last year, China-Africa trade reached $204.2 bil­lion (R2.9 tril­lion), up 20% year-on-year. China has been Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner for 10 years. Thus, the expo seems to be an ex­pected ini­tia­tive be­tween two par­ties that have had an im­pres­sively grow­ing re­la­tion­ship. African en­trepreneurs, along­side their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts, will show­case their prod­ucts, no doubt cul­mi­nat­ing in bi­lat­eral trade and in­fra­struc­ture agree­ments. The expo will co­in­cide with the G20 sum­mit in Osaka, Ja­pan. With the Sino-US trade ten­sions of­fer­ing a cheer­less back­drop to what por­tends to be an awk­ward sum­mit, is­sues con­cern­ing the devel­op­ing world are not ex­pected to dom­i­nate de­bate. The expo thus as­sumes even more im­por­tance in an in­ter­na­tional sys­tem that is cur­rently un­der­go­ing a resur­gence of ul­tra-na­tion­al­ism, in­su­lar sen­ti­ment and an­tipa­thy to­wards im­mi­grants who are not of Western prove­nance. While this con­text is re­gret­table in an era where glob­al­i­sa­tion is ex­pected to im­bue the world with tol­er­ance and an ac­cep­tance of ma­jor cities, es­pe­cially, as cul­tural and na­tional melt­ing pots, it pro­vides the devel­op­ing world op­por­tune im­pe­tus to con­cen­trate on be­ing prin­ci­pals and ar­biters of their re­gions and af­fairs. For al­most the whole of Africa, China has be­come an in­dis­pens­able player in help­ing the con­ti­nent to sur­mount its myr­iad chal­lenges. While Sino-African trade and eco­nomic ties have grown im­pres­sively, Africa re­mains rooted to the foot of the global food chain. The op­po­site is the case with China, a coun­try that just four decades ago was an agro-based, un­der­de­vel­oped, poor econ­omy but has risen to be­come the sec­ond­biggest econ­omy in the world. By next year, China plans to to­tally elim­i­nate poverty among its ci­ti­zens. Lin Song­tian, China’s am­bas­sador to South Africa, often evokes the es­ti­mated 700 mil­lion peo­ple that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has lifted out of poverty since the ad­vent of eco­nomic re­forms in 1978. Pre­vail­ing cir­cum­stances have seen a surge in pri­vate Chi­nese and African ci­ti­zens trad­ing places be­tween the re­gions with the in­ten­tion of putting down roots in their re­spec­tive coun­tries. While this is in kil­ter with the trend of glob­al­i­sa­tion, and has also pre­cip­i­tated ten­sion that emerges from ig­no­rance of each other, as well racial con­fronta­tion and the scram­ble for eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties. Op­por­tu­ni­ties such as those of­fered at the expo should be used to demon­strate China’s good in­ten­tions as it re­lates with Africa. It’s en­cour­ag­ing that since the on­set of the US-China trade war, Africa’s non-tra­di­tional ex­ports such as meat, fruit, nuts and to­bacco have im­proved. Trademaps es­ti­mates that meat ex­ports to China from the South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity had im­proved by 240%. If this mo­men­tum is sus­tained, it will help Africa to in­vest more in land, cli­mate change and hy­dro tech­nol­ogy. The expo will have a last­ing legacy if it touches on this.

za,The Mercury,20170906,Zuma calls for full speed on SDGs in poverty fight,"PRES­I­DENT Ja­cob Zuma has called for the “full im­ple­men­ta­tion” of the Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) as a means to erad­i­cate poverty. Zuma made his re­marks dur­ing the Dia­logue of the Emerg­ing Mar­kets and De­vel­op­ing Coun­tries on the mar­gins of the 9th Brics Sum­mit in Xiamen, China, on Mon­day. The dia­logue in­cluded lead­ers of Egypt, Guinea, Mex­ico, Ta­jik­istan and Thai­land. “Ad­dress­ing com­mon devel­op­ment chal­lenges is in­te­gral to build­ing a bet­ter fu­ture for all hu­mankind, as ev­i­denced by the col­lab­o­ra­tion that ex­ists be­tween the Brics na­tions and their var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional part­ners,” said Zuma. “Our joint ef­forts were fur­ther man­i­fested in the suc­cess­ful adop­tion of the 2030 Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Agenda. Full im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) has the po­ten­tial to erad­i­cate poverty.” He said re­vi­tal­is­ing the Global Part­ner­ship for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment could only be fully achieved if sup­ported by the con­crete poli­cies and ac­tions out­lined in the Ad­dis Ababa Ac­tion Agenda on Fi­nanc­ing for Devel­op­ment, also adopted in 2015, and which is an in­te­gral part of the 2030 Agenda. “The means of im­ple­men­ta­tion is fun­da­men­tal to the suc­cess of coun­tries meet­ing their de­vel­op­men­tal needs, and achiev­ing the SDGs, yet it is the one area that has re­ceived nei­ther the ap­pro­pri­ate at­ten­tion nor the req­ui­site pri­or­ity.” Zuma said African coun­tries were im­ple­ment­ing the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 of the AU in an in­te­grated man­ner. “This is to en­sure that we se­cure and utilise nat­u­ral re­sources sus­tain­ably.” He also noted that Brics part­ners had es­tab­lished their first fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, the New Devel­op­ment Bank, which is sup­port­ing its found­ing mem­bers. “Hope­fully soon, it will also sup­port our part­ners through pro­vid­ing devel­op­ment fi­nanc­ing for in­fra­struc­ture and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment projects. Zuma said the lead­er­ship of the AU en­gaged the Brics lead­er­ship at an early stage in­di­cat­ing its strong sup­port for this project and the re­cent launch of the Africa Re­gional Cen­tre was a most wel­come sig­nal of an in­ten­si­fy­ing part­ner­ship for devel­op­ment. “As the global south, it re­mains our col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity to in­crease our role in agenda set­ting and rule for­mu­la­tion in rel­e­vant fora, no­tably in the UN,” Zuma added. He said that in the lead-up to the 23rd Con­fer­ence of the Par­ties to the UN Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change, “we are con­fi­dent” that in­ter­na­tional sol­i­dar­ity will pre­vail and that coun­tries will en­cour­age and sup­port each other in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of their var­i­ous con­tri­bu­tions and obli­ga­tions. Com­ment­ing on ter­ror­ism, Zuma said: “South Africa strongly con­demns these hor­ren­dous acts and be­lieves that, in or­der to fight this scourge it is im­per­a­tive for the global com­mu­nity to unite as one and to in­ten­sify its col­lec­tive ef­forts to counter the chal­lenges that this poses to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity at large. “It re­mains our con­vic­tion that, given ter­ror­ism’s global reach, in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion in coun­ter­ing this threat is crit­i­cal. “South Africa, there­fore, fully sup­ports the global cam­paign against ter­ror­ism within the frame­work of the UN,” Zuma added.",南非

Sen­wes It does seem that the Con­sti­tu­tional Court has come out strongly in favour of the com­pe­ti­tion au­thor­i­ties in its first-ever rul­ing in a com­pe­ti­tion mat­ter. Un­less this in­ter­pre­ta­tion is way off the mark or un­less the Con­sti­tu­tional Court does, what ap­pears to a layper­son as a U-turn, then it does seem likely that it might rule in favour of the Com­pe­ti­tion Com­mis­sion in the Yarra and Lounge­foam cases. This pos­si­bil­ity makes yes­ter­day’s rul­ing one of the most sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ments in South Africa’s com­pe­ti­tion law in years. Of course as one lawyer noted yes­ter­day, the Con­sti­tu­tional Court’s Sen­wes judg­ment is care­fully worded to avoid set­ting any sort of prece­dent for Yarra and Lounge­foam. But it is hard not to no­tice a sense of frus­tra­tion with the Supreme Court of Ap­peal’s (SCA) re­stricted in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the pow­ers of the com­pe­ti­tion au­thor­i­ties in the Con­sti­tu­tional Court’s Sen­wes rul­ing. The Con­court rul­ing in­cluded a ma­jor­ity and mi­nor­ity decision in the Sen­wes mat­ter, both of which ar­gued against the SCA’S re­stric­tive stance. The mi­nor­ity rul­ing gives the Com­pe­ti­tion Tri­bunal even more au­thor­ity than the ma­jor­ity rul­ing. It refers to the tri­bunal need­ing to place an em­pha­sis on “speed, in­for­mal­ity and a non-tech­ni­cal ap­proach to its task” and notes that “ex­ces­sive for­mal­ity would not be in keep­ing with the pur­pose of the act”.

za,Sunday Times,20200510,Lao Peo­ple’s Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic,"Slowly it dawned on me — I was be­ing tailed on the run­way of what was once one of the busiest air­ports in the world and one of it’s most se­cret places. I’d been pho­tograph­ing a fam­ily of ducks strut­ting across the airstrip (such an ir­re­sistible metaphor: flight­less birds at an air­field with no planes). A Lao man in silky boxing shorts and white T seemed in­ter­ested in what in­ter­ested me, un­til I re­alised I wasn’t in­spir­ing him to see his sur­round­ings with new eyes or teach­ing him to find beauty in the mun­dane. No, he was tail­ing me be­cause I wasn’t to be trusted, I was to be re­ported on. I wasn’t sup­posed to be there. I’d snuck in to Long Chen a few hours ear­lier through deep mud and night forests with four mo­tor­cy­clists. A bot­tle-blonde, short-haired chick in jeans and boots on a dirt bike with a cam­era sticks out in ru­ral Laos. Soon a younger man si­dled across the run­way to “greet” me: “You should go,” he said. “Leave now.” This is the story of Laos’s sur­vival. It’s a place of se­crets and eva­sions, of steer­ing away strangers, of more than the eye can see — a place where spir­its drift off and shad­ows merge with mys­tery. The Lao Peo­ple’s Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic has been my home for six-and-a-half years. It’s a strip of land the size of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal com­bined, hemmed in on all sides: China to the north, Viet­nam to the east, Cam­bo­dia and Thai­land to the south, Myan­mar to the west. It has the mug­gi­est as­pects of KwaZulu-Natal’ s cli­mate with the Eastern Cape’s ru­ral poverty. It’s a place where peo­ple have sur­vived through the cen­turies by shun­ning change. Few strangers ap­pear via the un­nav­i­ga­ble Mekong River or through the jun­gled moun­tains to the north. When the oc­ca­sional stranger strag­gles through, they keep their head down and stay at a dis­tance. When the CIA’s Air Amer­ica planes took off from that se­cret run­way and tried to oblit­er­ate the Lao from the skies be­cause they mis­un­der­stood the war in the nextdoor coun­try they melted into the for­est or moved into the moun­tains, build­ing hos­pi­tals, homes and print­ing presses in caves. The Lao peo­ple won the Se­cret War by wait­ing it out, qui­etly. For nine years, bombs fell. Equiv­a­lent to half a ton per man, woman and child. From 1964 to 1973, the US dropped more than 2-mil­lion tons of ord­nance on Laos dur­ing 580,000 bomb­ing mis­sions — equal to a plane load of bombs ev­ery eight min­utes, 24 hours a day — mak­ing Laos the most heav­ily bombed coun­try per capita in his­tory. That’s the way they roll here: dis­solv­ing into ob­scu­rity. So­cial dis­tanc­ing? They’ve got this. I crave the South African hugs and hand­shakes, but the Lao “nop”: hands to­gether with bowed heads, as if in prayer. The kids’ stony-faced stares do my head in. Poker faces all round. There’s no phys­i­cal con­tact in pub­lic, not even be­tween a man and his wife. Ev­ery tuk­tuk taxi pas­sen­ger breathes ner­vously when I get in, in case I don’t know that women mustn’t touch nor make eye con­tact with monks. Lock­downs? Closed bor­ders, en­forced dis­ap­pear­ances, cen­sor­ship and cur­fews have eased over the past few years, but they’re still part of the DNA of this com­mu­nist state. Is the new norm just a re­turn to the old norm? There have been changes since I’ve been here — there’s a cin­ema, some fledg­ling shop­ping cen­tres, cof­fee shops on ev­ery cor­ner defin­ing the new ur­ban cool. In this Covid cri­sis, the gov­ern­ment has been proac­tive and trans­par­ent, de­spite the cyn­i­cism of ex­pats. But I fear that ru­ral Laos will re­turn to hid­ing for safety and that new-fan­gled ideas of gen­der equal­ity, vac­cines, fam­ily plan­ning and high-school ed­u­ca­tion will be seen as just more for­eign in­vaders, just like this strange and dan­ger­ous dis­ease brought in by Euro­peans though China (all 19 con­firmed cases here so far trace di­rectly to Europe and the UK). Now, if the gov­ern­ment did al­low peo­ple to travel to the next prov­ince, vil­lagers wouldn’t let them in. They have scare­crows on the road­sides, and wo­ven-grass mes­sages to bad spir­its: “Keep out. Your type isn’t wel­come.” I keep think­ing about that strip of tar­mac, which sent and re­ceived bombs and opium, rice and mer­ce­nar­ies, loy­alty and hero­ism, and death in bizarre barters, strange even four decades later, af­ter the de­clas­si­fi­ca­tion of doc­u­ments and pub­lished mem­oirs. That tar­mac is de­serted now, save for the ducks, but the legacy of the war re­mains. It came from the air but is still in the soil, wait­ing for the in­dus­tri­ous and the play­ful. Rusted un­ex­ploded ord­nance is still killing ru­ral peo­ple: farm­ers plough­ing their rice pad­dies, chil­dren play­ing with scrap. Long af­ter this Covid “war” is over, and China and Europe have sur­vived their eco­nomic de­pres­sions, the lethal virus “bombs” will still be killing vil­lagers: women will die in child­birth be­cause Covid pre­vented dis­tri­bu­tion of con­tra­cep­tives, kids who didn’t get vac­ci­nated will get ill, malaria tests won’t get made be­cause labs were churn­ing out Covid-19 kits. And yet, some­how, this quiet heart of South­east-Asia has evaded the global tragedy thus far. It’s part of the mys­tery in this land of se­crets.",南非
za,The Citizen (KZN),20151109,Myan­mar votes af­ter 25 years,"Yan­gon The eyes of the world were on Myan­mar yes­ter­day as the once pariah na­tion voted in gen­eral elec­tions be­ing con­tested by Aung San Suu Kyi’s op­po­si­tion for the first time in 25 years. Here are some facts about the former junta-run state: Blessed with a bounty of nat­u­ral resources – from ru­bies and jade to gas, oil and teak – fer­tile and di­verse Myan­mar was once also famed as Asia’s rice bowl. But nearly half a cen­tury of ru­inous eco­nomic poli­cies by the former junta saw its peo­ple sink into poverty as the gen­er­als plunged the coun­try into iso­la­tion. Once one of the most fash­ion­able ci­ties in Asia, Myan­mar’s former cap­i­tal Yan­gon was home to stately leafy boule­vards and Bri­tish colo­nial build­ings. But decades of junta ne­glect re­duced many to crum­bling wrecks, their fad­ing fa­cades over­run by weeds. The city to­day is in the grip of rapid change, thick with the dust and din of con­struc­tion as of­fice tow­ers peer over the once low-rise sky­line. The na­tion’s for­tunes have im­proved since the end of out­right mil­i­tary rule in 2011, with GDP grow­ing at an av­er­age of 7% a year. The World Bank has even pre­dicted that Myan­mar will be­come the world’s fourth-fastest-grow­ing econ­omy by 2017. But re­cent floods, the worst in decades, have dulled fore­casts, with ma­jor re­form bat­tles still to be won across all sec­tors. Mean­while life ex­pectancy re­mains among the low­est in the re­gion and 37% of the pop­u­la­tion still live in poverty, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank. Wedged be­tween In­dia and Bangladesh to the west, China to the north and Laos and Thai­land to the east, Myan­mar is home to more than 100 eth­nic groups. The ma­jor­ity are Bur­man and Bud­dhist, but there are size­able mi­nori­ties. Some of th­ese eth­nic groups have also waged the world’s longest civil war, with con­flict still rag­ing in north­ern Kachin and east­ern Shan states. –",南非

za,The Mercury,20190521,‘Ramaphosa right man for re­build­ing SA right now’,"CHI­NESE am­bas­sador to South Africa Lin Song­tian yes­ter­day said he was look­ing for­ward to work­ing with Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa as he was the right per­son at the right time for the coun­try. Lin and Am­bas­sador Anil Sook­lal, the deputy di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Depart­ment of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions, were the key­note speak­ers at a pub­lic lec­ture com­mem­o­rat­ing Africa Day held at the Univer­sity of KwaZulu-Na­tal’s Westville cam­pus. Lin said you would have to search hard to find a pres­i­dent with the qual­i­ties that Ramaphosa pos­sesses. “He un­der­stands busi­ness and when you run a gov­ern­ment you need to de­velop the econ­omy. “He is the right pres­i­dent at the right time to lead this coun­try in the right di­rec­tion. He knows the busi­ness, he knows the peo­ple and he knows the world.” Lin said South Africa was deal­ing with the same de­vel­op­ment is­sues that China faced decades ago and that un­em­ploy­ment, in­equal­ity and poverty could be re­duced with the right in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment part­ner. He said China was al­ready shar­ing its ex­per­tise with Africa and South Africa in the fields of re­new­able en­ergy, man­u­fac­tur­ing, dig­i­tal fi­nance, Ar­ti­fi­cial In­tel­li­gence and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and that this part­ner­ship was be­com­ing stronger. Lin was speak­ing on the topic “If China can achieve suc­cess, why not Africa?” He said the key to South Africa gen­er­at­ing for­eign in­vest­ment, im­prov­ing its in­fra­struc­ture and cre­at­ing jobs was to adopt a zero tol­er­ance ap­proach to cor­rup­tion. “We have a zero tol­er­ance at­ti­tude to any­thing that deals with cor­rup­tion. In China we tar­get cor­rup­tion case by case but we have also built a sys­tem to pre­vent any cor­rup­tion.” Once cor­rup­tion be­comes a non-is­sue in South Africa and gov­ern­ment pol­icy is fine-tuned to at­tract in­ter­na­tional in­vest­ment, the process of re­build­ing and strength­en­ing the econ­omy could be­gin, he said. “There must be com­mit­ment from ev­ery­one on the vi­sion, com­mit­ment, com­mon val­ues and com­mon dis­ci­pline.” Lin also said me­dia re­ports and crit­i­cism from the West over China push­ing African coun­tries into a “debt trap” was as a re­sult of con­cern over China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence on the con­ti­nent but also be­cause the in­vest­ment was lead­ing to eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence for the coun­tries. “Yes, the ma­jor debt for Ethiopia is from China but great changes have been made. China did not cre­ate a debt trap… we were asked to build a se­cond rail­way but ad­vised against it un­til Ethiopia could gen­er­ate the ca­pac­ity to make the oper­a­tion prof­itable. We stopped them from en­ter­ing the debt trap,” he said. The rail­way built in Mom­basa, Kenya, had con­trib­uted 1.5% to that coun­try’s GDP and 46 000 jobs. “China has no in­ten­tion to take over and our part­ner­ship in Africa is based on mu­tual trust and po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment be­cause we see your fu­ture is our fu­ture.” EN­VI­RON­MEN­TAL Af­fairs Min­is­ter Nomvula Mokonyane will not be re­turn­ing to the Cab­i­net; in­stead she is sched­uled to take up a se­nior post in Par­lia­ment.

za,Sowetan,20151027,In­dian com­pany seeks to buy South Africa coal mines,"NEW DELHI — IN­DIA hosts its big­gest-ever Africa sum­mit this week as Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi seeks to chal­lenge China’s dom­i­nance on a con­ti­nent that is blessed with vast nat­u­ral resources and has the world’s fastest-grow­ing pop­u­la­tion. New Delhi wants to project its soft power and his­tor­i­cal ties to Africa, in con­trast to China’s fo­cus on re­source ex­trac­tion and cap­i­tal in­vest­ment that has sparked a back­lash in some coun­tries against Bei­jing’s mer­can­tilist ex­pan­sion. Of the 54 coun­tries in­vited, the hosts ex­pect more than 40 to be rep­re­sented by their heads of state and gov­ern­ment who, af­ter a se­ries of min­is­te­rial meet­ings, will hold a full sum­mit on Thurs­day. In­dia’s trad­ing ties with Africa date back to an­tiq­uity and both found com­mon cause in the strug­gle against colo­nial rule. Yet In­dia’s in­flu­ence faded over the course of the Cold War as it with­drew into non­aligned iso­la­tion. Now Modi, self-styled chief sales­man of a “Made in In­dia” ex­port drive, wants to cap­i­talise on an eco­nomic slow­down in China to high­light In­dia as an al­ter­na­tive part­ner for trade and in­vest­ment. “In­dia is the fastest-grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy. Africa is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing rapid growth too,” Modi said on the eve of the sum­mit. Al­though In­dia’s head­line eco­nomic growth has over­taken China ’ s, its econ­omy is one-fifth the size and it lacks the financial heft to chal­lenge Bei­jing in a head-to-head con­test for the African mar­ket. “We can’t match the Chi­nese in terms of resources – but any en­gage­ment we do with the Africans at least gives them a choice,” said C Raja Mohan, a for­eign pol­icy com­men­ta­tor. Since the first In­dia-Africa Fo­rum Sum­mit in 2008, two-way an­nual trade has more than dou­bled to $72-bil­lion (R977-bil­lion). That lags trade be­tween China and Africa, which has ex­ploded to $200-bil­lion. – NEW DELHI – State-run oil com­pany ONGC, which has fields in Su­dan and South Su­dan, is on the hunt to buy R163-bil­lion in for­eign as­sets over the next three years and has iden­ti­fied Africa as an in­vest­ment tar­get. In­dia is also in talks with South Africa to buy coal mines pro­duc­ing up to 90 mil­lion tonnes of cok­ing coal each year to feed its grow­ing steel industry. In­dia wants its in­volve­ment in Africa to be less trans­ac­tional than China ’ s, seek­ing a de­vel­op­ment part­ner­ship for two re­gions that ac­count for a third of the world ’ s peo­ple, but seven in 10 of those live in poverty. “Our part­ner­ship is one that fo­cuses on Africa ’ s needs and In­dia ’ s strengths,” said Vikas Swarup, spokesman for the In­dian min­istry of ex­ter­nal af­fairs.",南非
za,Cape Times,20081209,Spate of safety scan­dals rocks shop­pers’ faith in China,"Milk, tooth­paste, cough syrup, pet food, eels, blood thin­ner, car parts, pork, eggs, honey, chicken, dumplings, cook­ing oil and rice – if you can fake it or taint it, you can al­most guar­an­tee it’s hap­pened in China. A string of prod­uct safety scan­dals, in­clud­ing con­tam­i­nated in­fant for­mula be­lieved to have killed six ba­bies and sick­ened thou­sands of oth­ers, have rocked the faith of shop­pers, mak­ing them wary of buy­ing prod­ucts made in China de­spite the of­ten cheaper price tag. “I was phys­i­cally dis­gusted when I saw it on the TV,” said Sally Vil­le­gas, a mother of two in Aus­tralia, re­fer­ring to the me­lamine-tainted in­fant for­mula scan­dal that came to light in Septem­ber. “If I’m shop­ping and I pick up a prod­uct made in China … I would put it back.” The me­lamine scan­dal was the lat­est in a string of re­cent high-pro­file safety prob­lems that in­clude lead paint on toy cars and con­tam­i­nated Chi­ne­se­made blood thin­ner hep­arin, which was blamed for fatal­i­ties in the US and Ger­many and prompted a global re­call early this year. Af­ter each scan­dal, Bei­jing of­fi­cials seemed to have the same re­sponse: launch a crack­down, de­stroy tainted goods on tele­vi­sion, jail a few of­fi­cials and say they “pay great at­ten­tion” to the prob­lem. Trou­ble is, for all the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts and ex­hor­ta­tions, the scan­dals keep hap­pen­ing, and will likely keep on hap­pen­ing, be­cause of lax rule en­force­ment, frag­mented in­dus­tries, wide­spread poverty and the sheer size of China, an­a­lysts say. “I’m sure that there will be more [scan­dals]. It’s a near cer­tain. Not only in the fields that we’ve seen al­ready, but in other ones,” said Dun­can Innes-Ker, a China an­a­lyst at the Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit in Bei­jing. “China faces a lot of prob­lems be­cause it is de­vel­op­ing into a big but very poor econ­omy, and ob­vi­ously you can’t have West­ern-style safety mech­a­nisms in an econ­omy where half the pop­u­la­tion doesn’t earn much more than a cou­ple of dol­lars a day,” he added. Jin Biao, the vice-pres­i­dent of In­ner Mon­go­lia Yili In­dus­trial Group, one of China’s largest dairy pro­duc­ers, ad­mit­ted that the me­lamine prob­lem had dented the coun­try’s al­ready badly tat­tered rep­u­ta­tion over­seas. “The con­tam­i­na­tion was our man­age­ment prob­lem,” he told Reuters. “We must first re­solve it without try­ing to pass the blame on to the farm­ers, or to so­ci­ety, or the coun­try.” Yili was named as one of 22 com­pa­nies found to have pro­duced drink­ing milk con­tam­i­nated with me­lamine, al­though af­ter thor­ough in­spec­tions China now in­sists the prob­lem has been ef­fec­tively re­moved from the dairy in­dus­try. Me­lamine, a chem­i­cal used to make plas­tics, was added to in­fant for­mula to cheat qual­ity con­trol tests on pro­tein lev­els. The scan­dal led to bans around the world on food con­tain­ing Chi­nese dairy prod­ucts. The US last month is­sued an im­port alert for Chi­nese-made food prod­ucts, call­ing for foods to be stopped at the bor­der un­less im­porters could cer­tify that they were ei­ther free of dairy goods or free of me­lamine. “I think it’s ev­i­dent to the Chi­nese that when there’s a qual­ity prob­lem, it does more than just hurt that in­dus­try seg­ment,” US health sec­re­tary Mike Leav­itt said on a visit to Shang­hai. “It dam­ages the en­tire made-in-China brand.” But it was not a sim­ple mat­ter just to boy­cott all Chi­nese goods, said Matthew Crabbe, the manag­ing di­rec­tor of re­search firm Ac­cess Asia. “I don’t think peo­ple re­ally un­der­stand how much is ac­tu­ally made in China,” he said.",南非
za,The Independent on Saturday,20200502,Call to end ‘wet mar­kets’,"THERE has been grow­ing pres­sure on the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO) from wildlife and an­i­mal or­gan­i­sa­tions across the globe in the wake of the dev­as­tat­ing Covid-19 pan­demic to for­mally sup­port an in­ter­na­tional ban on wildlife mar­kets, be­cause they pose “a se­vere risk to global health”. The source of the pan­demic has been linked to a wet mar­ket in Wuhan, China, where live wildlife was sold. On Tues­day, an open let­ter signed by 339 lead­ing an­i­mal wel­fare and con­ser­va­tion or­gan­i­sa­tions from around the world was sent to the WHO. This fol­lowed an ini­tial let­ter sent on April 6 by 241 or­gan­i­sa­tions which called on the WHO to state the proven link be­tween wildlife mar­kets and their se­ri­ous threat to hu­man health. At a me­dia brief­ing on April 17, the WHO’s Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus called on gov­ern­ments to “rig­or­ously en­force bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food”. But he fell short of call­ing for a global pro­hi­bi­tion of the com­mer­cial trade in wildlife and to close mar­kets that sell live wild an­i­mals or prod­ucts for pur­poses such as tra­di­tional medicines. “Wet mar­kets are an im­por­tant source of af­ford­able food and liveli­hood for mil­lions of peo­ple all over the world. But in many places, they have been poorly reg­u­lated and poorly main­tained,” said Ghe­breye­sus. The WHO’s po­si­tion is that when th­ese mar­kets are al­lowed to re­open, it should only be on the con­di­tion that they con­form to strin­gent food and safety and hy­giene stan­dards,” added Ghe­breye­sus. In an in­ter­view with the UK’s BBC, WHO spe­cial en­voy on Covid-19, Dr David Nabarro, was more suc­cinct, say­ing that while the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ad­vice to China was to close the wildlife mar­kets, “it’s the ad­vice ev­ery­where, this is dan­ger­ous”, but he added that the WHO did “not have the ca­pac­ity to police the world”. Among the 339 sig­na­to­ries of this week’s let­ter to the WHO was Dur­ban-based Blue Sky So­ci­ety Trust founder, Carla Geyser. The or­gan­i­sa­tion is ded­i­cated to con­ser­va­tion, wildlife pro­tec­tion and com­mu­nity up­lift­ment. Geyser said this week: “Wildlife mar­kets are cruel and bru­tal, and in­volve the sell­ing of wild an­i­mals for food, pets and some­times for tra­di­tional medicines. Th­ese mar­kets have been im­pli­cated by many sci­en­tists and re­searchers over the past few years as ini­tia­tors of pre­vi­ous pan­demics and not much has been done by lo­cal gov­ern­ments world­wide to reg­u­late them there­after. “The fact that you have so many dif­fer­ent species in­ter­act­ing within hor­rific con­di­tions and within close prox­im­ity to hu­mans, has al­lowed the spread of dis­eases to hap­pen quickly and more fre­quently. The stalls with a mul­ti­tude of an­i­mals and wildlife can be near each other, with no phys­i­cal sep­a­ra­tion, and this has be­come a breed­ing ground for th­ese viruses, that seem to be evolv­ing and mu­tat­ing and be­com­ing more de­struc­tive. “This Covid-19 pan­demic has once again high­lighted the dan­gers of th­ese mar­kets. I firmly be­lieve that the only way for­ward is to en­force a global ban on th­ese il­le­gal and un­reg­u­lated wildlife mar­kets sell­ing wild an­i­mals or prod­ucts. There are al­ter­na­tive food sources and tra­di­tional medicines, and I think the gov­ern­ment needs to up­date its poli­cies and clamp down to pre­vent an­other catas­tro­phe like this pan­demic from hap­pen­ing again,” she said. Also Dur­ban based, the Lawrence An­thony Earth Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s di­rec­tor, Yvette Tay­lor, said they stood firmly be­hind the call to ban wildlife mar­kets. “The Lawrence An­thony Earth Or­gan­i­sa­tion has been a sig­na­tory on the ‘Asia for An­i­mals Coali­tion’ as well as the ‘Global March for Ele­phants and Rhi­nos’ for some time. Col­lec­tively, we have all been fighting for the end in the global il­le­gal trade in wildlife. “The sys­tem­atic plun­der of Africa to sup­ply th­ese mar­kets must be stopped; it has made crim­i­nals of African peo­ple who par­tic­i­pate in poach­ing, and will lead to an ecosys­tem col­lapse which will fur­ther threaten food se­cu­rity. “The trade in wildlife has now im­pacted the en­tire planet and is likely to cre­ate poverty and suf­fer­ing as a re­sult. It is time that the world stood to­gether to end this bar­baric prac­tice. Wildlife mar­kets must be per­ma­nently closed,” Tay­lor said this week. The open let­ter from con­ser­va­tion and wildlife pro­tec­tion or­gan­i­sa­tions world­wide high­lighted that in­fec­tious dis­eases, which in­volve trans­mis­sion from an­i­mals to hu­mans (zoonotic dis­eases), in­cluded the Mers and Sars coro­n­aviruses; Ebola; HIV; bovine tu­ber­cu­lo­sis; and ra­bies; among oth­ers. “Zoonotic dis­eases are re­spon­si­ble for more than 2 bil­lion cases of hu­man ill­ness and over 2 mil­lion hu­man deaths each year. This in­cludes live­stock farm­ing. “Sixty per­cent of emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases are zoonotic, and 70% of th­ese are thought to orig­i­nate from wildlife. The risk of zoonotic dis­ease trans­mis­sion is height­ened fur­ther by the un­reg­u­lated and un­hy­gienic con­di­tions as­so­ci­ated with the wildlife mar­kets, where close prox­im­ity be­tween hu­mans and an­i­mals pro­vide the per­fect op­por­tu­nity for pathogens to spread,” stated the let­ter. The ap­peal re­quested the WHO to “pub­licly and un­equiv­o­cally state the proven link be­tween th­ese mar­kets and se­ri­ous threats to hu­man health... We urge the WHO to rec­om­mend that gov­ern­ments world­wide per­ma­nently ban wildlife mar­kets, and the use of wildlife in tra­di­tional medicine”. It said: “This de­ci­sive ac­tion, well within the WHO’s man­date, would be an im­pact­ful first step in adopt­ing a highly pre­cau­tion­ary ap­proach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to hu­man health.”",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20180903,A new blue­print,"TO­DAY and to­mor­row, the 3rd Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Focac) Sum­mit will be held in Bei­jing, where the lead­ers of China and Africa will come to­gether once again to sketch out a new blue­print for China-Africa friendly and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion, in­ject­ing new vigour and ful­fill­ing the as­pi­ra­tion of the Chi­nese and African peo­ple for a bet­ter fu­ture for China and Africa. Focac is a ma­jor plat­form of China-Africa col­lec­tive dia­logue, unity and co-op­er­a­tion es­tab­lished in re­sponse to the new devel­op­ment needs of China-Africa re­la­tions. Over the past 18 years since its in­cep­tion, Focac has es­tab­lished a set of com­pre­hen­sive, prac­ti­cal and highly ef­fi­cient mech­a­nisms, which con­sist of min­is­te­rial meet­ings, se­nior of­fi­cials meet­ing, China’s Sec­re­tariat of the Fol­low-Up Com­mit­tee and the meet­ing mech­a­nism of African am­bas­sadors to China. Focac con­venes the min­is­te­rial meet­ing ev­ery three years to make new plans for China-Africa friendly and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion. The se­nior of­fi­cials meet­ing is held yearly to fa­cil­i­tate co-or­di­na­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion. Over the years, through nu­mer­ous vis­i­ble and tan­gi­ble co-op­er­a­tion out- comes, Focac has proved that it is not a talk shop, but a fo­rum for ac­tion. To­day, Focac has al­ready be­come a flag­ship that spear­heads the co-op­er­a­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity with Africa. Equal­ity and mu­tual trust, prac­ti­cal re­sults and high ef­fi­ciency, and win-win co-op­er­a­tion are the defin­ing fea­tures of Focac, as well as the com­mon pur­suit of all Focac mem­bers. Focac is com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing African coun­tries as they achieve self-sus­tain­able devel­op­ment. It is our strong be­lief that if Africa is not in­de­pen­dent eco­nom­i­cally, it is im­pos­si­ble to be in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cally. With­out eco­nomic devel­op­ment, it is im­pos­si­ble to es­cape poverty and con­flict. To achieve self-sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, African coun­tries need to break through three bot­tle­necks, namely back­ward in­fra­struc­ture, lack of pro­fes­sional and skilled per­son­nel, and a lack of cap­i­tal sources. Who can help Africa re­solve those prob­lems, who is the true friend of Africa? In De­cem­ber 2015, dur­ing the Focac Jo­han­nes­burg Sum­mit, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and African lead­ers jointly opened up the new era of China-Africa win-win co-op­er­a­tion for com­mon devel­op­ment. Xi an­nounced Ten Ma­jor Co-op­er­a­tive Plans with $60 bil­lion of fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment to sup­port African in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion. These ef­forts have ef­fec­tively sup­ported Africa to over­come the bot­tle­necks. The China-Africa co-op­er­a­tion in the new era is no longer about cut­ting an equal share of the “cake” for ev­ery­one. In­stead, those who are ready first will ben­e­fit first, and the most. China-Africa mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion in the new era will no longer be re­stricted to devel­op­ment aid, but will be based on the prin­ci­ple of “gov­ern­ment guid­ance, busi­nesses be­ing the ma­jor ac­tors, mar­ket op­er­a­tion and win-win co-op­er­a­tion”. Over the years, Focac has achieved nu­mer­ous vis­i­ble and tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits for our peo­ples. China-Africa trade has in­creased from just more than $10bn in 2000 to $170bn last year. Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa has soared from less than $1bn in 2000 to more than $100bn. To date, China has helped fi­nance and build for Africa 6 500km of rail­ways, 6 200km of roads, 20 sea­ports, 20 bridges, more than 80 power plants, more than 200 schools and 80-plus sta­di­ums. Since 2016, China has pro­vided over 10 000 gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ships to African coun­tries per year. These ef­forts have greatly boosted Africa’s ca­pac­ity build­ing, mak­ing unique and im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to Africa’s pur- suit of self-sus­tain­able devel­op­ment. Themed “China and Africa: To­ward an Even Stronger Com­mu­nity with a Shared Fu­ture through Win-Win Co-op­er­a­tion”, the Focac Bei­jing Sum­mit is ex­pected to adopt the Bei­jing Dec­la­ra­tion and the Bei­jing Ac­tion Plan (2019-2021). The sum­mit will not only make com­pre­hen­sive plans for China-Africa co-op­er­a­tion for the next three years, but also fur­ther align the sum­mit’s theme with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment, the AU’s Agenda 2063 and the devel­op­ment strate­gies of in­di­vid­ual African coun­tries. More ef­forts will be made and more mea­sures will be taken to sup­port African coun­tries in ca­pac­ity build­ing, in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity, in­dus­try co-op­er­a­tion, green devel­op­ment, trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change, peace and se­cu­rity, and in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion. We are full of con­fi­dence that the Focac Bei­jing Sum­mit will fur­ther strengthen Africa’s ca­pac­ity for self-sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, pro­mote stronger China-Africa win-win co-op­er­a­tion for com­mon devel­op­ment, and bring more ben­e­fits to all the peo­ples of Africa and China.",南非

BEE poli­cies are not fail­ing at all; they are suc­ceed­ing in what they were meant to do. Even the ca­sual ob­server could see that BEE would be a heavy bur­den on the South African econ­omy. By its very na­ture, it leads to lower pro­duc­tiv­ity, brain drain, skills short­ages, re­duced in­vest­ment, higher com­pli­ance and mon­i­tor­ing costs, rent-seek­ing, in­com­pe­tence, cor­rup­tion, and in­creased busi­ness un­cer­tainty. All these ef­fects ham­per eco­nomic growth, which means fewer jobs, lower in­comes, and less tax rev­enues to pro­vide ba­sic ser­vices and so­cial grants. The worst-af­fected vic­tims of apartheid are to­day’s desperately poor and they are ar­guably the most de­serv­ing of re­dress. Yet BEE is clearly detri­men­tal to poverty al­le­vi­a­tion – a tragic irony in­deed. Fur­ther­more, I dis­agree strongly that there is any­thing morally right about BEE. Its laws com­pel pri­vate en­ter­prises to treat in­di­vid­u­als dif­fer­ently be­cause of their race. This is crude racial dis­crim­i­na­tion. To ac­cept BEE is to ac­cept that state-en­forced in­sti­tu­tional racism is morally jus­ti­fi­able un­der cer­tain cir­cum­stances. De­spite all of the above, po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors con­tinue to dwell on and give cre­dence to BEE. At the very least, they should be em­bar­rassed by their lack of imag­i­na­tion. There are many ex­cel­lent pol­icy al­ter­na­tives that would in­volve broad-based black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment on a mas­sive scale, with­out re­sort­ing to statu­tory dis­crim­i­na­tion or crip­pling wealth re­dis­tri­bu­tion.

Some­how, one lone singer in your col­umn al­most hit the right note, when he yo­delled: “China!”, but he ap­peared also to fail to hit the right notes. Take a look at the “make things” part: what tele­vi­sions, soft toys, irons, T-shirts, com­put­ers, and so on can you en­vis­age be­ing made faster or cheaper, and will al­ways be so, if South Africa is the bench­mark? Our poor pric­ing by way of wages in pro­por­tion to pro­duc­tiv­ity has reached a no re­turn zone. Pro­duc­tiv­ity can be im­proved through mech­a­ni­sa­tion, but that word and job cre­ation don’t sit well to­gether. What, be­sides low wages, a dis­ci­plined work­force, un­reg­u­lated labour laws, and govern­ment spon­sor­ship, does China have over South Africa? The word is “vol­ume”, the choke word for new and es­tab­lished South African busi­nesses. And they have the vol­umes be­cause they pro­duce on request for Amer­ica and Europe. China does very lit­tle re­search and devel­op­ment and is not strong in de­sign.

Do you re­ally pic­ture a large Amer­i­can fac­tory, hoof­ing it over here, ask­ing us to man­u­fac­ture their prod­uct? With what in­cen­tive? My main point is this: you do not make some­thing and ask the world to buy it. The world asks you to make prod­ucts for them to buy, and sell for­ward. That is a sub­tle, yet huge, dif­fer­ence. What can we do to make those com­pa­nies set up here, or ask us to man­u­fac­ture for them? We have to lis­ten to the peo­ple who are or were in busi­ness. Cre­ate and sing like a choir.

za,Cape Times,20100707,Poverty-rid­dled Luanda is now world’s dear­est ex­pat city,"LUANDA: In the An­golan cap­i­tal, with its seem­ingly end­less slums and crip­pling poverty, Jose Motto picked up a four­pack of yo­gurt priced at sev­eral times what it would cost at a fancy su­per­mar­ket in Europe. “This costs $20 (R152), at least three times what I would pay in Europe,” said Motto, a Por­tuguese na­tional who works as a hu­man re­sources con­sul­tant. Such is life in Luanda, an oil boom city that has grown well be­yond its means and has at­tracted hordes of for­eign work­ers com­pet­ing for scarce re­sources. The cap­i­tal, in a coun­try where most live in poverty, has over­taken Tokyo as the most ex­pen­sive in the world for for­eign­ers. For­eign­ers plop down $15 for a cheese­burger, $150 for hair­cuts, $2 500 for a one-year gym mem­ber­ship and tens of thou­sands of dol­lars for rent. But for the ma­jor­ity of An­golans, an es­ti­mated twothirds of whom live on less than $2 a day, the only thing the oil boom has made more af­ford­able is petrol, al­though many will never be able to buy a car in their life­time. The coun­try faces a hous­ing short­age as it re­cov­ers from a three-decade-long civil war that dev­as­tated the coun­try­side and prompted mil­lions to flee to the cities. With An­gola im­port­ing 90 per­cent of its build­ing ma­te­ri­als, con­struc­tion projects are ex­pen­sive and of­ten come with huge de­lays. “For­eign com­pa­nies know about the high cost of do­ing busi­ness in An­gola,” Nuno Ser­renho, head of Col­liers In­ter­na­tional in An­gola, said. “That’s why they in­crease the price of their prod­ucts and ser­vices to make up for their ex­tra costs, and still make a huge profit.” Prop­erty val­ues, par­tic­u­larly in the cap­i­tal, sky­rock­eted af­ter a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. When the war ended, the rush to tap into the coun­try’s oil wealth be­gan. An­gola ri­vals Nige­ria as Africa’s biggest oil pro­ducer. China has supplied bil­lions in loans to re­build in­fra­struc­ture, help­ing to fuel the prop­erty boom. The Asian pow­er­house im­ports more oil from An­gola than from any­where else in the world. Ho­tel prices have jumped. Rooms in An­gola’s first five-star ho­tel in the city’s res­i­den­tial area of Luanda Sul cost be­tween $700 and $5 000 a night, mak­ing them some of the costli­est in the world, but of­fer­ing few of the ameni­ties of the prime prop­er­ties in other cap­i­tal cities. An­gola, which ranks as one of the world’s most cor­rupt na­tions, wants to see more for­eign com­pa­nies in the coun­try to fill state cof­fers. It de­pends on tax and roy­alty fees from en­ergy firms for 90 per­cent of its in­come and re­lies heav­ily on oil rev­enue to fi­nance re­con­struc­tion. But the coun­try’s le­gions of poor see no re­lief in sight. “For­eign­ers nor­mally com­plain about the high cost of liv­ing in Luanda, but it is the poor who suf­fer the most,” said Vic­tor Ribeiro, a fa­ther of four chil­dren who earns $500 a month as a driver for an ex­pa­tri­ate.",南非
za,Finweek English Edition,20151119,The price of China’s eco­nomic sup­port,"theFo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion sum­mit, which will take place in Jo­han­nes­burg next month, will once again cast a spot­light on the re­la­tions be­tween South Africa and China. Since the es­tab­lish­ment in 1998 of diplo­matic links be­tween the two coun­tries, the bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship has grown rapidly to be­come one of the clos­est be­tween an African coun­try and the emerg­ing global su­per­power. The im­por­tance both coun­tries at­tach to the bur­geon­ing re­la­tion­ship is un­der­scored by the fre­quency of high-level vis­its un­der­taken by po­lit­i­cal lead­ers in re­cent years. Un­der­pin­ning the strong po­lit­i­cal and diplo­matic ties has been grow­ing eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion. Viewed through China’s lens, SA’s boun­ti­ful min­eral wealth has el­e­vated Pre­to­ria-Bei­jing re­la­tions to strate­gic im­por­tance. Also, China views SA’s re­gional power sta­tus as jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for el­e­vat­ing co­op­er­a­tion to a strate­gic level. This ex­plains why China pushed hard to ex­tend an in­vi­ta­tion to SA to join the Brics group­ing. The cre­ation of the Brics Devel­op­ment Bank rep­re­sents an op­por­tu­nity for SA to tap into an al­ter­na­tive source of finance to ad­dress the econ­omy’s devel­op­ment needs. Thanks to China, SA is also a mem­ber of the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank. In SA’s strate­gic cal­cu­la­tions, China’s im­port re­sides pri­mar­ily with it be­ing a grow­ing source of for­eign in­vest­ment that SA needs des­per­ately to ame­lio­rate press­ing do­mes­tic so­cial chal­lenges, no­tably high un­em­ploy­ment, poverty and in­equal­ity. SA re­gards China’s sup­port as cru­cial to pro­mot­ing Africa’s in­ter­ests in the United Na­tions and other mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions. SA also views the deep­en­ing of eco­nomic links with China (and with the other Brics coun­tries) as cen­tral to its eco­nomic strat­egy of di­ver­si­fy­ing its ex­ter­nal trade away from Europe. There is no doubt that the SA-China re­la­tion­ship is in many ways com­ple­men­tary and is poised to be­come stronger and grow fur­ther in the fu­ture. Yet the ques­tion this raises is whether SA can suf­fi­ciently ac­com­mo­date China’s needs and, if so, at what cost. Sat­is­fy­ing China’s needs will de­pend on the ex­tent to which do­mes­tic con­stituen­cies in SA – mainly labour unions, the busi­ness sec­tor and civil so­ci­ety for­ma­tions – feel that their con­cerns about China’s in­flu­ence on SA’s po­lit­i­cal econ­omy are be­ing ad­dressed. Labour unions have voiced con­cerns about the im­pact of Chi­nese tex­tile im­ports on lo­cal jobs and wages: they have blamed the ‘neo-colo­nial’ na­ture of the trade re­la­tion­ship for the de-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of the SA econ­omy. The lo­cal busi­ness com­mu­nity has ques­tioned SA’s de­ci­sion to grant China mar­kete­con­omy sta­tus, mak­ing it very dif­fi­cult for lo­cal firms to prove that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment gives its com­pa­nies an un­fair ad­van­tage. Also, China’s eco­nomic ex­pan­sion into Africa has been seen as a threat by South African com­pa­nies who have lost mar­ket share in SA’s ‘near abroad’. Civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions have voiced un­easi­ness over the bale­ful in­flu­ence of the ex­pand­ing SA-China eco­nomic re­la­tions on SA’s for­eign pol­icy. The Dalai Lama visa de­ba­cle at­tests to the re­al­ity that eco­nomic prag­ma­tism has trumped the for­eign pol­icy ide­al­ism of the Man­dela years. China has shown that it is at­tuned to the sen­si­tiv­i­ties of South African do­mes­tic pol­i­tics. That is why, for ex­am­ple, it pre­vi­ously ac­ceded to SA’s re­quest to im­pose quo­tas on its tex­tile ex­ports (al­beit for only two years) and un­der­took to work with SA to cor­rect the un­bal­anced trade pro­file be­tween the two coun­tries – by urg­ing Chi­nese firms to ex­pand in­vest­ment in the coun­try’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor and pro­mote lo­cal ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of raw ma­te­ri­als. It is clear, how­ever, that China’s re­spon­sive­ness and flex­i­bil­ity in this re­gard will re­main con­di­tional upon SA main­tain­ing un­fet­tered ac­cess to its min­eral re­sources for Chi­nese firms, upon not ques­tion­ing China’s pol­icy po­si­tions in mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums and upon not in­ter­fer­ing in China’s do­mes­tic af­fairs – as ev­i­denced by the Dalai Lama af­fair. China’s eco­nomic sup­port for SA, there­fore, comes at a price. The ques­tion is whether South Africans are pre­pared to pay it. There is no doubt that the South Africa-China re­la­tion­ship is in many ways com­ple­men­tary and is poised to be­come stronger and grow fur­ther in the fu­ture.",南非

Down­ing Street re­futed there was “sci­en­tific con­sen­sus” that a pan­demic was im­mi­nent, nod­ding to tweets from Hor­ton in Jan­uary which urged cau­tion about call­ing it a “killer virus”. Hor­ton re­jected claims he played down the threat of the virus, and in­stead said he had sounded the alarm on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions. Hor­ton linked to tweets he penned in Jan­uary which warned hu­mans could spread the virus be­tween each other and that there was a lack of ICU beds to cope with a pan­demic. He pub­lished grave con­cerns from China – where the virus be­gan in De­cem­ber 2019 – warn­ing other gov­ern­ments to act quickly. The Lancet jour­nal is among the world’s old­est, hav­ing a global im­pact sec­ond only to The New Eng­land Jour­nal of Medicine. Hor­ton de­nies Down­ing Street’s claim there was a lack of sci­en­tific con­sen­sus that the world was head­ing to­wards a pan­demic. A news­pa­per ar­ti­cle in the Sun­day Times ac­cused Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son of “sleep­walk­ing into dis­as­ter” in the early stages of the pan­demic. It pointed out that John­son missed five key CO­BRA meet­ings as the Covid-19 cri­sis gath­ered pace, that No 10 “played down the loom­ing threat” from coro­n­avirus for more than a month. Mean­while, the true ex­tent of the death toll in Bri­tain from Covid-19 was more than 40% higher than the daily fig­ures from the gov­ern­ment in­di­cated by April 10, ac­cord­ing to data that in­cludes deaths in the com­mu­nity. The Of­fice for Na­tional Sta­tis­tics said it recorded 13121 deaths by April 10 in Eng­land and Wales, which ac­count for the vast ma­jor­ity of Bri­tain’s pop­u­la­tion, com­pared with 9 288 in the gov­ern­ment’s daily toll. The lat­est hospi­tal deaths data pub­lished on Mon­day show 17 382 peo­ple had died across the UK. If the UK’s fig­ures are un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the death toll by a sim­i­lar fig­ure, then the true death toll for the coun­try as a whole could be above 23000 – mak­ing it the sec­ond worst hit in Europe af­ter Italy.",南非
za,Pretoria News,20170810,NEW CHI­NESE AM­BAS­SADOR TO SA,"OVER THE past few years South Africa and China may have worked hard to strengthen re­la­tions. But it ap­pears there’s am­ple room for growth. This is ex­actly the am­bi­tion driv­ing new Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to South Africa, Lin Song­tian. The coun­try’s new Chi­nese rep­re­sen­ta­tive ar­rived at OR Tambo In­ter­na­tional Air­port yes­ter­day and wasted no time out­lin­ing his plans to fos­ter and im­prove diplo­matic ties be­tween the two coun­tries. “It is my great hon­our to be able to serve as the Chi­nese am­bas­sador to South Africa at this im­por­tant mo­ment, as both our coun­tries move to fur­ther eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. I feel the tremen­dous re­spon­si­bil­ity en­trusted upon my­self from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and the Chi­nese peo­ple. I will spare no ef­forts in ful­fill­ing my mis­sion,” he said. He would use his role as am­bas­sador to fol­low the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith as ad­vo­cated by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, he said. China is South Africa’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner. It is also a ma­jor in­vestor in the econ­omy. In De­cem­ber 2014, Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma hosted Jin­ping stat­ing that the coun­try would re­main in a solid part­ner­ship with China.

za,Pretoria News,20100719,"Busi­ness must lis­ten, then sing like a choir","QUENTIN Wray’s “Long-ter m com­mon sense a sight for sore eyes” (Busi­ness Re­port, July 5) dis­plays the re­mark­ably lazy think­ing that has dom­i­nated the dis­cus­sion of af­fir ma­tive ac­tion, em­ploy­ment eq­uity and black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment poli­cies (here­after col­lec­tively re­ferred to as BEE). Wray im­plic­itly as­sumes that these poli­cies are nec­es­sary to re­duce poverty and in­equal­ity. This is non­sense. In fact, they are not even de­signed for that pur­pose. They are concerned pri­mar­ily with the rapid trans­fer of wealth from (rel­a­tively) priv­i­leged whites to (rel­a­tively) priv­i­leged blacks. Their ex­press in­ten­tion is to in­crease black rep­re­sen­ta­tion within ev­ery mid­dleto-up­per in­come quin­tile. From the be­gin­ning, this in­cluded the busi­ness elites and very rich. BEE poli­cies are not fail­ing at all; they are suc­ceed­ing in what they were meant to do. Even the ca­sual ob­server could see that BEE would be a heavy bur­den on the South African econ­omy. By its very na­ture, it leads to lower pro­duc­tiv­ity, brain drain, skills short­ages, re­duced in­vest­ment, higher com­pli­ance and mon­i­tor­ing costs, rent-seek­ing, in­com­pe­tence, cor­rup­tion, and in­creased busi­ness un­cer­tainty. All these ef­fects ham­per eco­nomic growth, which means fewer jobs, lower in­comes, and less tax rev­enues to pro­vide ba­sic ser­vices and so­cial grants. The worst-af­fected vic­tims of apartheid are to­day’s desperately poor and they are ar­guably the most de­serv­ing of re­dress. Yet BEE is clearly detri­men­tal to poverty al­le­vi­a­tion – a tragic irony in­deed. Fur­ther­more, I dis­agree strongly that there is any­thing morally right about BEE. Its laws com­pel pri­vate en­ter­prises to treat in­di­vid­u­als dif­fer­ently be­cause of their race. This is crude racial dis­crim­i­na­tion. To ac­cept BEE is to ac­cept that state-en­forced in­sti­tu­tional racism is morally jus­ti­fi­able un­der cer­tain cir­cum­stances. De­spite all of the above, po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors con­tinue to dwell on and give cre­dence to BEE. At the very least, they should be em­bar­rassed by their lack of imag­i­na­tion. There are many ex­cel­lent pol­icy al­ter­na­tives that would in­volve broad-based black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment on a mas­sive scale, with­out re­sort­ing to statu­tory dis­crim­i­na­tion or crip­pling wealth re­dis­tri­bu­tion. Pro­fes­sor Themba Sono has de­scribed just some of these ex­cit­ing op­tions in his book From Poverty to Prop­erty. First, di­rect own­er­ship of the paras­tatals should be dis­trib­uted equally among JU­LIAN LE ROUX CON­STAN­TIA, CAPE TOWN It is amaz­ing, how from academia to the fields of fi­nance, com­merce, and pol­i­tics, they all sing from the same hymn book, and the song goes “must cre­ate jobs, must re­duce un­em­ploy­ment”. They are all lone singers who never form a choir. And there are some lyrics missing, like: cre­ate work, mak­ing what, for whom, to sell into which mar­ket? Some­how, one lone singer in your col­umn al­most hit the right note, when he yo­delled: “China!”, but he ap­peared also to fail to hit the right notes. Take a look at the “make things” part: what tele­vi­sions, soft toys, irons, T-shirts, com­put­ers, and so on can you en­vis­age be­ing made faster or cheaper, and will al­ways be so, if South Africa is the bench­mark? Our poor pric­ing by way of wages in pro­por­tion to pro­duc­tiv­ity has reached a no re­turn zone. Pro­duc­tiv­ity can be im­proved through mech­a­ni­sa­tion, but that word and job cre­ation don’t sit well to­gether. What, be­sides low wages, a dis­ci­plined work­force, un­reg­u­lated labour laws, and govern­ment spon­sor­ship, does China have over South Africa? The word is “vol­ume”, the choke word for new and es­tab­lished South African busi­nesses. And they have the vol­umes be­cause they pro­duce on request for Amer­ica and Europe. China does very lit­tle re­search and devel­op­ment and is not strong in de­sign. The Amer­i­cans do all the re­search and devel­op­ment, send across the qual­ity con­trollers, pat­terns or moulds, en­sure that the best and lat­est equip­ment is in place, and train the staff. Do you re­ally pic­ture a large Amer­i­can fac­tory, hoof­ing it over here, ask­ing us to man­u­fac­ture their prod­uct? With what in­cen­tive? My main point is this: you do not make some­thing and ask the world to buy it. The world asks you to make prod­ucts for them to buy, and sell for­ward. That is a sub­tle, yet huge, dif­fer­ence. What can we do to make those com­pa­nies set up here, or ask us to man­u­fac­ture for them? We have to lis­ten to the peo­ple who are or were in busi­ness. Cre­ate and sing like a choir.

The Cho­sun Ilbo news­pa­per re­ports said that four jour­nal­ists from the news­pa­per Joon­gAng Ilbo, a re­searcher and a guide were taken into cus­tody on Tues­day in a mil­i­tary re­stricted zone near the Tu­men River that marks the bor­der. Three South Korean For­eign Min­istry of­fi­cials con­firmed that Joon­gAng Ilbo re­porters were de­tained near the river, and said they were be­ing held at a ho­tel. But they dis­puted parts of the Cho­sun Ilbo ac­count, say­ing five peo­ple, not six, were de­tained, and they would not con­firm the num­ber of jour­nal­ists nor whether they were caught in­side a re­stricted mil­i­tary zone. The of­fi­cials spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, cit­ing the sen­si­tiv­ity of ef­forts to se­cure the re­porters’ re­lease. A Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman in Bei­jing said the agency was look­ing into the re­ports. Joon­gAng Ilbo de­clined to com­ment. China is al­ways touchy about bor­der se­cu­rity and in the best of cir­cum­stances dis­likes snoop­ing by for­eign re­porters. The bor­der with ally North Korea is par­tic­u­larly sen­si­tive, with many North Kore­ans sneak­ing across to look for work, find food or flee poverty and re­pres­sion. One of the South Korean of­fi­cials said the re­porters were trav­el­ing on tourist visas. China re­quires for­eign re­porters to ob­tain jour­nal­ist visas if they want to re­port in­side the coun­try and has ex­pelled or jailed re­porters work­ing with­out proper cre­den­tials. In 2003, China im­pris­oned a South Korean free­lance jour­nal­ist on charges of hu­man traf­fick­ing.

za,Cape Times,20210127,Ramaphosa calls for fair vac­cine roll-out,"PRES­I­DENT Cyril Ramaphosa has called for greater global col­lab­o­ra­tion on the roll-out of Covid-19 vac­cines to en­sure that peo­ple from poorer coun­tries get vac­ci­nated. Ramaphosa spoke out against what he called vac­cine na­tion­al­i­sa­tion yes­ter­day, telling the vir­tual World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) meet­ing that the pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of na­tional in­ter­est above col­lab­o­ra­tion had led to un­equal ac­cess in the fight against a global pan­demic. Ramaphosa said that poor coun­tries had been left fac­ing long waits for their first doses as rich na­tions had gob­bled nearly all the global sup­ply of the two lead­ing Covid-19 vac­cines. He said that South Africa was pro­mot­ing the need for uni­ver­sal, fair and eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines. Ramaphosa said that the global pan­demic will not end if some coun­tries were vac­ci­nat­ing while oth­ers were not. “Coro­n­avirus af­fects all of us equally, and our reme­dies and ac­tions to com­bat it must also be equal,” Ramaphosa said. “End­ing the pan­demic world­wide will re­quire greater col­lab­o­ra­tion on the roll-out of vac­cines, en­sur­ing that no coun­try is left be­hind in this ef­fort,” he said. The World Bank has re­ported that ex­treme poverty was ex­pected to rise glob­ally for the first time in more than 20 years as the dis­rup­tion caused by the pan­demic ex­ac­er­bates the ef­fects of con­flict, cli­mate change and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. A group of cam­paign­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing Amnesty In­ter­na­tional, Front­line Aids, Global Jus­tice Now and Ox­fam, also warned that 9 out of 10 peo­ple in poor coun­tries are set to miss out on Covid-19 vac­cine this year. World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO) di­rec­tor gen­eral Dr Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus last week pointed out that only 25 peo­ple had been vac­ci­nated in Africa com­pared with 39 mil­lion in rich coun­tries Ghe­breye­sus said that the world was on the “brink of a cat­a­strophic moral fail­ure”. The AU has es­tab­lished a Covid-19 African Vac­cine Ac­qui­si­tion Task Team to se­cure and find sources of fund­ing for suf­fi­cient vac­cines.

za,Pretoria News,20151021,Xi brings £30bn shot in the arm for Bri­tain,"DAVID Cameron said Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping would bring more than £30 bil­lion (R609bn) in deals and in­vest­ment on his visit to Bri­tain this week, as the prime min­is­ter de­fended him­self against charges that he was be­ing too warm to­wards his vis­i­tor. The deals would cre­ate 3 900 jobs in the UK, in sec­tors in­clud­ing the cre­ative in­dus­tries, re­tail, en­ergy, health and tech­nol­ogy, financial ser­vices, aero­space and ed­u­ca­tion, Cameron’s of­fice said in a state­ment, with­out giv­ing fur­ther de­tails.

za,The Sunday Independent,20131110,China’s Com­mu­nist Party faces mo­ment of de­ci­sion as econ­omy slows down,"THREE-and-a half decades af­ter China veered from com­mu­nism to­ward state-di­rected cap­i­tal­ism, Asia’s eco­nomic en­gine is run­ning out of gas. The Chi­nese econ­omy is bogged down by an in­creas­ingly in­ef­fi­cient state sec­tor and an ex­plo­sion in debt. It has pretty much reached the limit of how much it can grow through ex­ports, and its eco­nomic suc­cess story is threat­ened by en­vi­ron­men­tal dis­as­ter and so­cial inequal­ity. On Satur­day, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping will open a four-day gath­er­ing of 376 Com­mu­nist Party big­wigs at Bei­jing’s heav­ily guarded Jingxi Ho­tel. What lies be­fore them, ac­cord­ing to El­iz­a­beth Econ­omy of the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions (CFR), is no less than “chang­ing the fun­da­men­tals of how the Chi­nese econ­omy op­er­ates”. The im­pli­ca­tions of the meet­ing – known as the Third Plenum of the 18th Cen­tral Com­mit­tee – are huge, not just for China and the sur­vival of its Com­mu­nist Party, but also for the rest of the world. Mea­sures to fur­ther open the econ­omy and en­cour­age Chi­nese con­sumers to spend more could bring sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits for US com­pa­nies. In China, the trans­for­ma­tion of the once-so­cial­ist econ­omy has pro­duced av­er­age eco­nomic growth of about 10 per­cent a year over more than 30 years, lift­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty and rais­ing China’s share of the global econ­omy from about 2 per­cent in 1980 to 15 per­cent now, ac­cord­ing to ratings agency Fitch. But to­day, eco­nomic growth is slow­ing down, and an­a­lysts say there is an ur­gent need for re­forms that were de­layed dur­ing the past decade – among them, un­leash­ing mar­ket forces, pro­mot­ing in­no­va­tion and re­duc­ing the role of the state, stim­u­lat­ing pur­chas­ing by Chi­nese con­sumers and rein­ing in free-spend­ing lo­cal govern­ments. “The plate is very full, and the din­ner is get­ting cold,” said Pa­trick Cho­vanec, the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Sil­ver­crest As­set Man­age­ment in New York and a long-time China ex­pert. “They have a lot of things to do, and all of them have reached a point where they can no longer be put off.” Un­der China’s five-year po­lit­i­cal cy­cle, the first two ple­nary ses­sions of the party’s cen­tral com­mit­tee man­age top-level lead­er­ship ap­point­ments; the third tra­di­tion­ally sets the tone for pol­icy, es­pe­cially eco­nomic pol­icy, un­der that new lead­er­ship. In 1978, the Third Plenum was the oc­ca­sion when – af­ter the death of Mao Ze­dong and the top­pling of the rad­i­cal Gang of Four – Deng Xiaop­ing pushed through changes that launched China’s eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. To­day, China’s boom is in­creas­ingly based on bor­row­ing money from do­mes­tic savers at very low govern­ment-reg­u­lated in­ter­est rates and lend­ing it lav­ishly to gi­ant sta­te­owned en­ter­prises run by the Com­mu­nist Party aris­toc­racy; on de­press­ing the cur­rency and sub­si­dis­ing en­ergy costs to pro­mote ex­ports and in­dus­try; and on in­vest­ing heav­ily in in­fra­struc­ture but ig­nor­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal costs in a quest for wealth. Lo­cal govern­ments kick farm­ers off their land with min­i­mal com­pen­sa­tion and reap vast re­wards in prop­erty de­vel­op­ment to fi­nance grandiose in­fra­struc­ture plans, but ghost cities and half-empty ports sug­gest that not all the money has been spent wisely. Im­bal­ances in the econ­omy are grow­ing. The risk is that China will fall into what de­vel­op­ment econ­o­mists call the “mid­dle-in­come trap”, im­mensely suc­cess­ful in drag­ging its way out of poverty through debt­fi­nanced state in­vest­ment – but un­able to make the tran­si­tion to a rich, in­no­va­tive and dy­namic mod­ern econ­omy. Arthur Kroe­ber, a found­ing part­ner of the re­search firm GK Drago­nomics, says China has done rea­son­ably well at wean­ing it­self off an ex­ces­sive de­pen­dence on ex­ports since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2007-08 un­der­cut for­eign de­mand for its goods. But the recipe for suc­cess was a huge eco­nomic stim­u­lus plan and a rapid ex­pan­sion in lend­ing to lo­cal govern­ments and state-owned en­ter­prises. Econ­o­mists say that spend­ing spree can­not con­tinue for­ever. “The prob­lem to me is that they have reached the lim­its of be­ing able to stim­u­late high rates of growth through in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing,” Kroe­ber said. “They need to think of other ways. The process has also en­trenched the po­si­tion of state-owned en­ter­prises and made them much more dif­fi­cult to dis­lodge at a time when the re­turn on their in­vest­ments is plum­met­ing,” he said. The party’s top lead­ers have been aware of the prob­lems for a decade, but no progress was made in ad­dress­ing them un­der then-pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao. Last week­end, Xi promised a group of for­eign ex­perts that the Third Plenum would un­veil “a blue­print of com­pre­hen­sive re­forms”. He has talked in re­cent months about re­forms en­ter­ing “the deep­wa­ter zone where tough chal­lenges must be met”. At an eco­nomic fo­rum in Septem­ber, premier Li Ke­qiang promised to rely on “de­ter­mi­na­tion, like a brave war­rior who cuts his wrists, to ad­vance re­forms”. So far, though, the signs have been mixed, with credit con­tin­u­ing to ex­pand rapidly and a much-vaunted new Free Trade Zone in Shang­hai prov­ing a dis­ap­point­ment, with few sig­nif­i­cant con­ces­sions to in­vestors an­nounced. With pow­er­ful fig­ures and fam­i­lies at the top of the party’s lead­er­ship – as well as myr­iad lo­cal of­fi­cials – prof­it­ing from the sta­tus quo, change will be dif­fi­cult. “There is a re­al­i­sa­tion at the top level of what needs to change, but that re­al­i­sa­tion has ex­isted for the past decade as well,” CFR’s Econ­omy said. “The real ques­tion is whether this new set of Chi­nese lead­ers can do a bet­ter job of im­ple­ment­ing the nec­es­sary changes than their pre­de­ces­sors.” China ex­perts are di­vided about whether the slow-down will help fo­cus minds, or make the process of ad­just­ment so painful that it will con­tinue to be put off. Some worry that the credit boom has reached dan­ger­ous pro­por­tions and that a decade or more of eco- nomic stag­na­tion – a fate not un­like Ja­pan’s – could beckon as more and more of the credit in the econ­omy goes into rolling over bad debts. In April, Fitch down­graded its rat­ing on China’s lo­cal cur­rency debt; last month, the agency warned that the in­vest­ment-driven eco­nomic model was un­sus­tain­able. The Com­mu­nist Party’s ob­ses­sion with guar­an­tee­ing fast eco­nomic growth ac­tu­ally may make it harder for its lead­ers to aban­don the debt- and in­vest­ment-driven model of growth and re­lin­quish con­trol of the econ­omy to mar­ket forces. “They have got to get off that tiger, but they don’t know how to get off,” Cho­vanec said. Oth­ers, such as Kroe­ber and Ni­cholas Lardy, of the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomics in Wash­ing­ton, ar­gue that the party can grad­u­ally rein in credit with­out pro­vok­ing an eco­nomic col­lapse. But they don’t un­der­es­ti­mate the need for de­ci­sive ac­tion – soon. No one is ex­pect­ing fire­works from the closed-door plenum. Ob­servers ex­pect to hear talk of fi­nan­cial re­form and pledges to fight cor­rup­tion. There are likely to be some steps to en­cour­age small and medium-size en­ter­prises. There may even be talk of giv­ing farm­ers more rights over col­lec­tively owned ru­ral land. “I am not ex­pect­ing a lot of specifics,” Lardy said. “But I would want to see a fairly se­ri­ous blue­print.” The real test, ob­servers agree, is likely to come in the months af­ter the plenum. “The prob­lem is how to re­al­lo­cate the in­ter­ests, and who should give up their in­ter­ests,” said Chen Gong, the founder of An­bound Con­sult­ing in Bei­jing. – Wash­ing­ton Post-Bloomberg",南非

za,The Mercury,20100719,"Busi­ness must lis­ten, then sing like a choir","QUENTIN Wray’s “Long-term com­mon sense a sight for sore eyes” (Busi­ness Re­port, July 5) dis­plays the re­mark­ably lazy think­ing that has dom­i­nated the dis­cus­sion of af­fir­ma­tive ac­tion, em­ploy­ment eq­uity and black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment poli­cies (here­after col­lec­tively re­ferred to as BEE). Wray im­plic­itly as­sumes that these poli­cies are nec­es­sary to re­duce poverty and in­equal­ity. This is non­sense. In fact, they are not even de­signed for that pur­pose. They are concerned pri­mar­ily with the rapid trans­fer of wealth from (rel­a­tively) priv­i­leged whites to (rel­a­tively) priv­i­leged blacks. Their ex­press in­ten­tion is to in­crease black rep­re­sen­ta­tion within ev­ery mid­dleto-up­per in­come quin­tile. From the be­gin­ning, this in­cluded the busi­ness elites and very rich. BEE poli­cies are not fail­ing at all; they are suc­ceed­ing in what they were meant to do. Even the ca­sual ob­server could see that BEE would be a heavy bur­den on the South African econ­omy. By its very na­ture, it leads to lower pro­duc­tiv­ity, brain drain, skills short­ages, re­duced in­vest­ment, higher com­pli­ance and mon­i­tor­ing costs, rent-seek­ing, in­com­pe­tence, cor­rup­tion, and in­creased busi­ness un­cer­tainty. All these ef­fects ham­per eco­nomic growth, which means fewer jobs, lower in­comes, and less tax rev­enues to pro­vide ba­sic ser­vices and so­cial grants. The worst-af­fected vic­tims of apartheid are to­day’s desperately poor and they are ar­guably the most de­serv­ing of re­dress. Yet BEE is clearly detri­men­tal to poverty al­le­vi­a­tion – a tragic irony in­deed. Fur­ther­more, I dis­agree strongly that there is any­thing morally right about BEE. Its laws com­pel pri­vate en­ter­prises to treat in­di­vid­u­als dif­fer­ently be­cause of their race. This is crude racial dis­crim­i­na­tion. To ac­cept BEE is to ac­cept that state-en­forced in­sti­tu­tional racism is morally jus­ti­fi­able un­der cer­tain cir­cum­stances. De­spite all of the above, po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors con­tinue to dwell on and give cre­dence to BEE. At the very least, they should be em­bar­rassed by their lack of imag­i­na­tion. There are many ex­cel­lent pol­icy al­ter­na­tives that would in­volve broad-based black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment on a mas­sive scale, with­out re­sort­ing to statu­tory dis­crim­i­na­tion or crip­pling wealth re­dis­tri­bu­tion. Pro­fes­sor Themba Sono has de­scribed just some of these ex­cit­ing op­tions in his book From Poverty to Prop­erty. First, di­rect own­er­ship of the paras­tatals should be dis­trib­uted equally among It is amaz­ing, how from academia to the fields of fi­nance, com­merce, and pol­i­tics, they all sing from the same hymn book, and the song goes “must cre­ate jobs, must re­duce un­em­ploy­ment”. They are all lone singers who never form a choir. And there are some lyrics missing, like: cre­ate work, mak­ing what, for whom, to sell into which mar­ket? Some­how, one lone singer in your col­umn al­most hit the right note, when he yo­delled: “China!”, but he ap­peared also to fail to hit the right notes. Take a look at the “make things” part: what tele­vi­sions, soft toys, irons, T-shirts, com­put­ers, and so on can you en­vis­age be­ing made faster or cheaper, and will al­ways be so, if South Africa is the bench­mark? Our poor pric­ing by way of wages in pro­por­tion to pro­duc­tiv­ity has reached a no re­turn zone. Pro­duc­tiv­ity can be im­proved through mech­a­ni­sa­tion, but that word and job cre­ation don’t sit well to­gether. What, be­sides low wages, a dis­ci­plined work­force, un­reg­u­lated labour laws, and govern­ment spon­sor­ship, does China have over South Africa? The word is “vol­ume”, the choke word for new and es­tab­lished South African busi­nesses. And they have the vol­umes be­cause they pro­duce on request for Amer­ica and Europe. China does very lit­tle re­search and devel­op­ment and is not strong in de­sign. The Amer­i­cans do all the re­search and devel­op­ment, send across the qual­ity con­trollers, pat­terns or moulds, en­sure that the best and lat­est equip­ment is in place, and train the staff. Do you re­ally pic­ture a large Amer­i­can fac­tory, hoof­ing it over here, ask­ing us to man­u­fac­ture their prod­uct? With what in­cen­tive? My main point is this: you do not make some­thing and ask the world to buy it. The world asks you to make prod­ucts for them to buy, and sell for­ward. That is a sub­tle, yet huge, dif­fer­ence. What can we do to make those com­pa­nies set up here, or ask us to man­u­fac­ture for them? We have to lis­ten to the peo­ple who are or were in busi­ness. Cre­ate and sing like a choir.

za,The Star Late Edition,20090113,There’s more to the cri­sis than dol­lars and cents,"As cap­i­tal­ism stag­gers through its first glob­alised eco­nomic cri­sis, the costs won’t be mea­sured only in dol­lars and cents. From newly rich Rus­sia to im­pov­er­ished sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, so­cial strains are threat­en­ing the es­tab­lished po­lit­i­cal or­der, putting some coun­tries’ very sur­vival at risk. The dis­il­lu­sion­ment and spillover ef­fects of the global re­ces­sion “are not only likely to spark ex­ist­ing con­flicts in the world and fuel ter­ror­ism, but also jeop­ar­dise global se­cu­rity in gen­eral”, says Louis Michel, the EU’s de­vel­op­ment aid com­mis­sioner. The US hous­ing slump that be­gan in 2007 has cas­caded into a world­wide cri­sis that forced cen­tral bankers to cut in­ter­est rates to near zero to un­lock credit mar­kets; pushed gov­ern­ments to bail out their big­gest banks amid $1 tril­lion (R9.8 tril­lion) of write-downs; and sent ti­tans such as Gen­eral Motors and Amer­i­can In­ter­na­tional Group beg­ging for bailouts. The World Bank reck­ons trade will shrink for the first time in more than 25 years, deep­en­ing the eco­nomic hole for gov­ern­ments in de­vel­op­ing na­tions, where higher food and fuel prices cost con­sumers an ex­tra $680 bil­lion last year and pushed as many as 155 mil­lion peo­ple into poverty. Ni­co­las Sarkozy said last week. With glob­al­i­sa­tion, he said, “we ex­pected com­pe­ti­tion and abun­dance, and in the end we got scarcity, debt, spec­u­la­tion and dump­ing”. Some will stand His­to­ri­ans say it’s too early to de­clare the end of the in­ter­twin­ing of the global econ­omy, un­der way at least since the col­lapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989. For one thing, de­vel­oped na­tions still have a huge stake in the sys­tem: even with $29 tril­lion wiped off the value of global eq­uity mar­kets last year, the Dow Jones in­dus­trial av­er­age is back where it was in 2003, hardly a time of pri­va­tion. As a re­sult, dis­tur­bances in the West – from Greece’s worst ri­ots since the 1970s to a 31 per­cent in­crease in New Year’s Eve car torch­ings in France – won’t shake the foun­da­tions of those so­ci­eties. It’s the failed or fail­ing states that stand to lose the most. “The punch line: poverty does cause vi­o­lence,” says Ray­mond Fis­man, a pro­fes­sor at Columbia Busi­ness School in New York. Re­searchers led by Ed­ward Miguel of the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia have even quan­ti­fied it: a 5 per­cent drop in na­tional in­come in African coun­tries in­creases the risk of civil con­flict in the fol­low­ing year to 30 per­cent. The frailest na­tions are those south of the Sa­hara. The re­gion ac­counts for seven of the top 10 coun­tries in a rank­ing of “failed” states com­piled by the Fund for Peace, a Wash­ing­ton­based re­search group. With com­mod­ity prices sink­ing, min­ing com­pa­nies in­clud­ing An­glo Amer­i­can, De Beers, Lon­min and Xs­trata are slash­ing jobs, adding to Africa’s eco­nomic woes. Nige­ria, which has the con­ti­nent’s big­gest fos­sil fuel re­serves, is star­ing into a $5 bil­lion bud­get hole due to the oil price swoon. It con­fronts an em­bold­ened guer­rilla move­ment in the Niger Delta, the oil­pro­duc­ing re­gion that has at­tracted the likes of Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron. “The out­look is not op­ti­mistic,” says Pauline Baker, the pres­i­dent of the Fund for Peace, which ranks Nige­ria 18th on the most-at-risk list. “Un­less Nige­ria be­gins to pull it­self to­gether, I think, with the low­er­ing oil price in par­tic­u­lar, it is quite vul­ner­a­ble.” As in­comes shrivel in the poor world, the rich world isn’t able to fill the gap. Even when the go­ing was good, the Group of Eight in­dus­trial pow­ers were strug­gling to meet a 2005 com­mit­ment to in­crease an­nual aid to poor coun­tries by $50 bil­lion by 2010. Now, of­fi­cial do­na­tions are set to fall by as much as 30 per­cent, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pre­dicts. The IMF may need an­other $150 bil­lion to help re­verse the dam­age to emerg­ing mar­kets, says manag­ing di­rec­tor Do­minique Strauss-Kahn. While “de­mand may be above what we have”, he says he is con­vinced the IMF could scrounge up the ex­tra funds. China’s trou­bles Mean­while, China may be headed to­wards do­mes­tic re­pres­sion. While growth of 7.5 per­cent as pre­dicted by the World Bank will out­strip that of the in­dus­trial economies, the pace will be the slow­est since 1990. China’s recipe for rais­ing the stan­dard of liv­ing has re­lied on cre­at­ing jobs in coastal boom towns such as Shang­hai as a mag­net for mil­lions of poor from the vast, ru­ral in­te­rior. Now that for­mula is break­ing down. More than 10 mil­lion mi­grant work­ers lost their jobs in the first 11 months of last year, an uniden­ti­fied labour min­istry of­fi­cial told Cai­jing Mag­a­zine last month. Us­ing Com­mu­nist Party code for ri­ots and civil dis­or­der, the state-con­trolled Out­look Mag­a­zine warned last week that a spike in “mass in­ci­dents” would test the gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to pre­serve the so­cial peace. In a worst-case sce­nario, US in­tel­li­gence agen­cies warn, the com­mu­nist lead­er­ship would roll back China’s in­te­gra­tion into the world econ­omy. “Al­though a pro­tracted slump could pose a se­ri­ous po­lit­i­cal threat, the regime would be tempted to de­flect pub­lic crit­i­cism by blam­ing China’s woes on for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, stok­ing the more vir­u­lent and xeno­pho­bic forms of Chi­nese na­tion­al­ism,” the US Na­tional In­tel­li­gence Coun­cil con­cluded in Novem­ber. China has known out­bursts of chau­vin­ism in the past and re­mained in­tact, thanks to a so­cial hi­er­ar­chy dat­ing back to the age of Con­fu­cius. Poorer coun­tries lack­ing that po­lit­i­cal an­chor face a bleaker out­look. The cri­sis “could un­der­mine the de­vel­op­ment mo­men­tum”, says Liberia’s Pres­i­dent Ellen John­son Sir­leaf. “It would mean job­less­ness would in­crease, and that could un­der­mine the sta­bil­ity of na­tions.”",南非
za,Cape Times,20191004,Meet the gen­eral trend of the times,"ONLY staunch ad­her­ence to mu­tual re­spect, peace­ful de­vel­op­ment and win-win co-oper­a­tion can meet the gen­eral trend of the times. The gen­eral de­bate of the 74th ses­sion of the Gen­eral As­sem­bly con­cluded this past Sun­day and pro­vided an open plat­form for the lead­ers from the dif­fer­ent coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions to elab­o­rate their pro­pos­als and ex­change views, fo­cus­ing on this year’s theme of gal­vanis­ing mul­ti­lat­eral ef­forts for poverty erad­i­ca­tion, qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion, cli­mate ac­tion and in­clu­sion. Iron­i­cally, US lead­ers, law­mak­ers and se­nior of­fi­cials utilised this plat­form to make wan­ton and ground­less crit­i­cism on China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs re­lated to Tai­wan, Ti­bet, Xin­jiang and Hong Kong, and fur­ther­more, they even spared no ef­forts to sow dis­cord and drive a wedge be­tween China and other coun­tries in this re­gard. How­ever, these ill-in­ten­tions will even­tu­ally fail, be­cause these al­le­ga­tions are lies that can­not with­stand scru­tiny, and cer­tain politi­cians of the US are only ob­sessed in a mono­logue of wish­ful think­ing. Re­cently, US Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence re­fused to meet the Solomon Is­lands’ leader for dis­cus­sions on de­vel­op­ment co-oper­a­tion, and the spokesper­son of the US De­part­ment of State said they were dis­ap­pointed by Solomon Is­lands’ de­ci­sion to sever its “di­plo­matic ties” with Tai­wan and Bei­jing’s con­tin­ued cam­paign to squeeze Tai­wan’s in­ter­na­tional space and change the cross-strait sta­tus quo. How­ever, the ba­sic facts are the US es­tab­lished di­plo­matic ties with China on the ba­sis of the one-China prin­ci­ple back in 1979. So did 178 coun­tries since 1949, when the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China was founded. Tai­wan is an in­alien­able part of China’s ter­ri­tory and the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China is the sole le­git­i­mate govern­ment rep­re­sent­ing the whole of China, which is the uni­ver­sal con­sen­sus of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Does this put the US in an em­bar­rass­ing po­si­tion to crit­i­cise its own na­tional cred­i­bil­ity and its in­ter­fer­ence in the do­mes­tic af­fairs of China and the Solomon Is­lands? On Septem­ber 24, US Pres­i­dent Trump crit­i­cised China’s stance on the con­tin­ued protest in Hong Kong in his speech at the Gen­eral De­bate of the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly. The US Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions LIN JING Com­mit­tee and the House For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee even passed the so-called Hong Kong Hu­man Rights and Democ­racy Act. How­ever, the ba­sic facts are the protesters in Hong Kong went too far to ex­er­cise their le­gal rights – they are be­com­ing vi­o­lent rad­i­cals car­ry­ing out ter­ror­ist and crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties un­der the cover of free­dom and democ­racy, with for­eign forces back­ing them. They bru­tally as­saulted and in­jured the po­lice and brought pub­lic fa­cil­i­ties like the air­port and sub­way to a stand­still. As for Hong Kong, the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” ar­range­ment has been a big suc­cess, a fact that no one can deny. The over­whelm­ing voice from the ma­jor­ity of Hong Kong cit­i­zens is to fully sup­port the Hong Kong SAR govern­ment and po­lice to stop vi­o­lence, re­store or­der and de­fend the rule of law. It is doubted whether the US politi­cians still re­mem­ber what they did when they han­dled demon­stra­tions of the 2011 Oc­cupy Wall Street move­ment. There is no worse in­sult to free­dom, democ­racy and hu­man rights than this when they are de­fam­ing Hong Kong po­lice by call­ing their for­bear­ance and re­straint “overuse of force”. On Septem­ber 22, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo called on all coun­tries to re­sist China’s de­mands to repa­tri­ate Uighurs. Deputy Sec­re­tary of State John Sul­li­van co-hosted a panel dis­cus­sion for UN del­e­ga­tions and non-gov­ern­men­tal part­ners on the “hu­man rights cri­sis” in Xin­jiang on Septem­ber 24 and some US law­mak­ers ir­ra­tionally launched the “Ti­betan Pol­icy and Sup­port Act of 2019” in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives. How­ever, the ba­sic facts are: Ti­bet (Xizang) and Xin­jiang have been parts of China’s ter­ri­tory for cen­turies. Ti­bet and Xin­jiang have been the fastest-grow­ing re­gions and un­der­gone un­prece­dented changes in all walks of life since 1949. The Chi­nese govern­ment pro­tects its cit­i­zens’ hu­man rights and free­dom of reli­gious be­lief and peo­ple of all eth­nic groups en­joy full reli­gious free­dom in ac­cor­dance with law. There are nearly 200 mil­lion reli­gious be­liev­ers across China, in­clud­ing 20 mil­lion Mus­lims. There are more than 380 000 cler­ics, ap­prox­i­mately 5 500 reli­gious groups and over 140 000 places of wor­ship reg­is­tered for reli­gious ac­tiv­i­ties. While, ac­cord­ing to poll re­sults re­leased by Gallup and Pew Re­search Cen­tre, 75% of Mus­lims be­lieve there is se­ri­ous dis­crim­i­na­tion against them in the US. What the US did is a se­ri­ous breach of ba­sic norms gov­ern­ing in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and a gross in­ter­fer­ence in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs with dou­ble stan­dards, and it sends out a gravely wrong sig­nal to sep­a­ratist, ex­trem­ist and ter­ror­ist forces in Ti­bet and Xin­jiang. The in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity will see it clearly that the deeds of the US fully ex­posed its con­sis­tent tricks of in­ter­fer­ing with for­eign sov­er­eign coun­tries that do not meet their own in­ter­ests, un­der the cloak of reli­gion, hu­man rights and democ­racy. The root cause lies in US hege­mony men­tal­ity that its in­ter­ests and con­cepts are al­ways su­pe­rior to oth­ers’. As State coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter of China, Wang Yi pointed out in his key­note speech – at a din­ner co-hosted by the Na­tional Com­mit­tee on US-China Re­la­tions, US-China busi­ness coun­cil, US Cham­ber of Com­merce and Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions – dif­fer­ences and dis­par­i­ties should not be a chasm pre­vent­ing peo­ple from en­gag­ing each other. Rather, they could be­come an im­pe­tus for mu­tual learn­ing and shared progress. We must find a way for two ma­jor coun­tries dif­fer­ent in so­cial sys­tem and cul­tural back­ground to live to­gether on this planet in peace and to co-op­er­ate with each other for win-win re­sults. Sim­i­larly, the ad­vance of hu­man civil­i­sa­tion must not stop, still less go back­wards. For all the coun­tries and civil­i­sa­tions in a new era of this planet, only staunch ad­her­ence to mu­tual re­spect, peace­ful de­vel­op­ment and win-win co-oper­a­tion can meet the gen­eral trend of the times. ● Lin is the Chi­nese Con­sul-Gen­eral",南非
za,Daily Dispatch,20121129,Mar­cus warns more pay could mean fewer jobs,"UNIONS must re­alise that get­ting higher wages for work­ers could be at the cost of jobs, SA Re­serve Bank Gov­er­nor Gill Mar­cus told Numsa del­e­gates yes­ter­day. She was speak­ing in Rand­burg, Jo­han­nes­burg, at a Na­tional Union of Me­tal­work­ers of SA (Numsa) con­fer­ence to de­cide on next year’s bar­gain­ing strat­egy. “It is very im­por­tant to re­alise that there is a po­ten­tial wors­en­ing of the sit­u­a­tion,” said Mar­cus, af­ter pre­sent­ing an over­view of the global eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion. Ear­lier, Numsa first vice-pres­i­dent An­drew Chirwa warned that the 2013 col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing process was go­ing to be very dif­fi­cult be­cause work­ers were not pre­pared to ac­cept CPI-linked in­creases any­more, and wanted what they con­sid­ered a “liv­ing wage”. “Higher wages might well be granted, but it could be at the cost of em­ploy­ment,” cau­tioned Mar­cus. She said that there was “no ques­tion” that ex­ec­u­tives’ salaries re­quired the same kind of scru­tiny by their share­hold­ers and boards, es­pe­cially bonuses. This was the sixth year of a global cri­sis, since the sub-prime mort­gage cri­sis which turned into a bank­ing cri­sis and then “mut into a sov­er­eign debt cri­sis, she said. One third of South Africa’s man­u­fac­tured goods went to Europe, where many coun­tries were in a re­ces­sion and un­em­ploy­ment was in­creas­ing. For the first year of a re­ces­sion, there were re­sources to fall back on, like sav­ings and pen­sions, she said, but by six years, there was noth­ing left. “The sit­u­a­tion in Europe is ex­tremely bad. And let’s make an as­sump­tion that noth­ing gets worse.” In emerg­ing mar­kets, which are do­ing rel­a­tively bet­ter than ad­vanced economies, China’s growth, for ex­am­ple, was slow­ing to 7.5%. South Africa would be “de­lighted” with this growth, but it was slow for China, and if China’s mar­kets in Europe were slow­ing down, they would buy fewer com­modi­ties from South Africa for their own man­u­fac­tur­ing. Even Brazil, with its “Lula moment”, was see­ing only 2% growth, she said, re­fer­ring to former Brazil­ian pres­i­dent Luiz Lula da Silva’s rad­i­cal eco­nomic shift dur­ing his sec­ond term of of­fice and cited by Cosatu as an ex­am­ple of how poverty could be ad­dressed in South Africa. “It is go­ing to take five, six, seven, years be­fore we come out of this deep hole,” warned Mar­cus. South Africa was not im­pos­ing aus­ter­ity mea­sures as some other coun­tries were, she con­tin­ued. It would also not in­ter­fere with the rand/dol­lar ex­change rate, as rec­om­mended by some unions, to ben­e­fit ex­porters. Mar­cus said there was no ques­tion that ex­treme poverty needed to be ad­dressed as there was a high level of in­equal­ity in South African so­ci­ety. “South Africa is a very in­ter­est­ing coun­try. We’re ac­tu­ally a rich coun­try with a huge num­ber of poor peo­ple – both blacks and whites have ex­tremes of wealth,” she said. She also dis­missed sug­ges­tions that the SARB should be a sta­te­owned cen­tral bank, say­ing such a move would be a waste of “bil­lions of rands”. Ear­lier this year, Numsa reaf­firmed its po­si­tion that the SARB should be na­tion­alised. The res­o­lu­tion stated: “The SA Re­serve Bank [SARB] is pri­vately owned and in­flu­ences the Mon­e­tary Pol­icy Com­mit­tee to adopt pro-busi­ness in­ter­est rates, cul­mi­nat­ing in the work­ing class be­ing re­duced to the work­ing poor and [be­ing] un­able to af­ford ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties.” Mar­cus told del­e­gates the gov­er­nor of the cen­tral bank was ap­pointed by the pres­i­dent of the coun­try, and that share­hold­ers ac­tu­ally had no say in the pol­icy and had only lim­ited rights. They elected fewer than half the peo­ple to the board, and got a nom­i­nal div­i­dend fixed in law. She said the SARB was con­sti­tu­tion­al­lyto the en­tirety of South Africa, whether state-owned or not, and said she would not be party to na­tion­al­is­ing the bank. — Sapa",南非
za,Saturday Star,20190907,Pope slams cor­rupt lead­ers,"POPE Fran­cis, end­ing his visit to Mozam­bique, yes­ter­day scolded po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness lead­ers in the re­source-rich but poor coun­try who al­lowed them­selves to be cor­rupted by out­siders. On his last day in the coun­try, Fran­cis vis­ited a hos­pi­tal for HIV-AIDS suf­fer­ers run by the Sant’ Egidio com­mu­nity and then held mass for some 60000 of peo­ple in Ma­puto’s na­tional sta­dium. At the hos­pi­tal and in his homily, Fran­cis spoke of all four of the main themes of the trip to the coun­try as well as Mada­gas­car and Mau­ri­tius – peace, poverty, cor­rup­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. “Mozam­bique is a land of abun­dant nat­u­ral and cul­tural riches, yet para­dox­i­cally, great num­bers of its peo­ple live be­low the poverty level,” Fran­cis said in the sta­dium, in an area of the cap­i­tal where many peo­ple live in shacks. At the Aids hos­pi­tal, the pope saw a cross made of wood and shards of me­tal from the col­lapsed roof of the home of an elderly woman. Ac­cord­ing to the UN World Food Pro­gramme, 80% of Mozam­bique’s pop­u­la­tion of about 30 mil­lion can­not af­ford the min­i­mum costs for an ad­e­quate diet. “At times it seems that those who ap­proach with the al­leged de­sire to help have other in­ter­ests. Sadly, this hap­pens with broth­ers and sis­ters of the same land, who let them­selves be cor­rupted. It is very dan­ger­ous to BAD FOR BUSI­NESS think that this is the price to be paid for for­eign aid,” Fran­cis said. Mozam­bique ranks in the low­est quar­ter of Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional’s Cor­rup­tion Per­cep­tions In­dex. While the pope did not give any spe­cific ex­am­ples of cor­rup­tion, Mozam­bique is still strug­gling to re­cover from the im­pact of a $2 bil­lion (R37bn) debt scan­dal, which saw hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in bor­row­ing guar­an­teed by the Mozam­bique gov­ern­ment dis­ap­pear. The money was borrowed osten­si­bly to de­velop ship­yards, mar­itime se­cu­rity and a tuna fish­ing ven­ture, but US au­thor­i­ties now say the projects were an elab­o­rate front for a bribe and kickback scheme. Boats ac­quired for the projects mean­while are rust­ing in har­bours across Mozam­bique. Crim­i­nal and civil court cases re­lated to the scan­dal and span­ning three con­ti­nents have en­snared in­ter­na­tional in­vest­ment bank Credit Suisse, which helped ar­range the loans, three of its for­mer bankers, a for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter and the for­mer Mozam­bique pres­i­dent’s son.

This is an ex­cit­ing op­por­tu­nity to be part of a vi­sion to lift bil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty, to show that de­vel­op­ment can hap­pen with col­lab­o­ra­tion; af­ter all, it is col­lab­o­ra­tion, the shar­ing of ideas and im­ple­men­ta­tion of this vi­sion, that can change the world for the bet­ter. The me­dia are a pow­er­ful and in­flu­en­tial force. Some will con­tinue paint­ing Brics na­tions in a bad light, high­light­ing slow de­vel­op­ment and cor­rup­tion, whether fac­tual or per­ceived. Some will show up coun­try dif­fer­ences as schisms, in­stead of dif­fer­ences in poli­cies. Brics coun­tries are, af­ter all, five na­tions with dif­fer­ing pol­icy frame­works and views. None of that is con­tested. I see, as you sit here, your pas­sion for jour­nal­ism and me­dia in its en­tirety and how you can chan­nel that pas­sion into Brics sto­ries. I get very ex­cited when I see con­tent which gets to the heart of the mat­ter, where we give a voice to the peo­ple whose lives are im­pacted ev­ery time Brics cuts red tape and works to­gether to build in­fra­struc­ture. Ev­ery time that hap­pens, lives change. The chal­lenge is ours to find those hu­man sto­ries which show how ef­fec­tive Brics can be. I am not ad­vo­cat­ing that all sto­ries should be pos­i­tive. Brics coun­tries must be held ac­count­able for all their ac­tions, good or bad. It is the role of the me­dia to high­light both. It is the me­dia which have the strength and the power to in­flu­ence pol­icy change. Nige­rian au­thor Chi­ma­manda Ngozi Adichie said: “Many sto­ries mat­ter. Sto­ries have been used to dis­pos­sess and to ma­lign. But sto­ries can also be used to em­power, and to hu­man­ise. Sto­ries can break the dig­nity of a peo­ple.

za,Cape Argus,20100920,"When China jumps, the world will shake","CON­SER­VA­TION has con­tro­ver­sially been de­scribed as the good cause of the filthy rich. This concerned book about China’s phe­nom­e­nally rapid devel­op­ment and ex­pan­sion tack­les the huge en­vi­ron­men­tal ques­tions threat­en­ing the lives of our grand­chil­dren. The con­test be­tween the al­le­vi­a­tion of poverty (and the rise of con­sumerism) on the one hand, and the ca­pac­ity of the planet is es­pe­cially stark in China with its pop­u­la­tion of nearly 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple. Where Western Europe, Ja­pan and the United States have man­aged to clean up their en­vi­ron­ments in part by ex­port­ing pol­lut­ing in­dus­tries (to China and else­where), China, a late ar­rival, can­not eas­ily do so and has pol­luted its rivers, de­nuded its coun­try­side and choked its cities. The dra­matic speed and scale of China’s in­dus­trial growth is aided by a seem­ingly end­less sup­ply of cheap work­ers en­ter­ing the cities, and ex­tremely poor reg­u­la­tion by ubiq­ui­tous cor­rupt Com­mu­nist Party func­tionar­ies at pro­vin­cial and lo­cal level. As the author puts it: “Weak govern­ment and pol­lu­tion go hand in hand. China’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is nei­ther dic­ta­tor­ship nor democ­racy. For the en­vi­ron­ment, it con­tains the worst el­e­ments of both. At the top, the state lacks the author­ity to im­pose pol­lu­tion reg­u­la­tions and wildlife con­ser­va­tion laws, while at the bot­tom cit­i­zens lack the demo­cratic tools of a free press, in­de­pen­dent courts and elec­tions to de­fend their land, air and wa­ter. The gap in be­tween is filled by lo­cal gov­ern­ments, town­ship en­ter­prises, mi­grant work­ers and for­eign cor­po­ra­tions, many of whom are fo­cused on eco­nomic growth at the ex­pense of all else. Who can blame the Chi­nese for seek­ing the life­style which many in the West al­ready have and in­deed in­creas­ingly seek to ex­pand upon? More­over, the rulers in China point to the much higher per capita pol­lu­tion and en­ergy us­age of the wealthy Western na­tions, both his­tor­i­cally and cur­rently, as they again in­sisted at the 2009 Copen­hagen Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence. This is com­pounded by a min­i­mal con­cern for the en­vi­ron­ment. The at­ti­tude of the pre­dom­i­nant eth­nic group, the Han Chi­nese, is that “the world is there for our use – we must at­tempt to im­pose our or­der on the world”. This, Watts says, is re­in­forced by Con­fu­cian­ism which he con­trasts with the more “na­ture-rev­er­ent” Dao­ism. Watts, an award-win­ning Asia En­vi­ron­men­tal Cor­re­spon­dent of the Guardian news­pa­per, gives a de­tailed ge­o­graph­i­cal and so­ci­o­log­i­cal ac­count of this vast coun­try, and is well aware of the ten­sion be­tween rais­ing Chi­nese liv­ing stan­dards and ex­haust­ing the coun­try’s nat­u­ral re­sources and foul­ing the land and the rivers with con­se­quent dis­ease and mis­ery. Death rates among Chi­nese farm­ers are now four times the global av­er­age for liver can­cer and twice the global av­er­age for stom­ach can­cer. Ni­trates and phos­phates from fer­tilis­ers, un­treated hu­man waste and chem­i­cal pol­lu­tants are also rapidly foul­ing China’s seas. The author’s cen­tral mes­sage is that the uni­ver­sally sought im­prove­ments in the peo­ples’ ma­te­rial lives re­sult­ing from devel­op­ment can­not be sus­tained. The big ques­tion is whether even China’s au­thor­i­tar­ian regime, de­spite en­demic sys­temic cor­rup­tion, can suc­ceed in forc­ing upon China a long-term, vi­able pol­icy for the planet. Watts has no il­lu­sions that a demo­cratic regime would guar­an­tee any­thing of the sort. The book dra­mat­i­cally doc­u­ments the vast scale of China’s ex­pan­sion, but the reader is left with the de­press­ing im­pres­sion that the quest for ma­te­rial ad­vance­ment will re­sult in eco­log­i­cal catas­tro­phe for all of us. More­over, al­though the author barely dis­cusses this, there are al­ready well over one bil­lion prospec­tive con­sumers in the ad­mit­tedly slower-mov­ing In­dia, In­done­sia and Brazil alone, even if au­to­cratic China should suc­ceed mirac­u­lously in go­ing truly green and sus­tain­able.",南非

Some­times peo­ple think push­ing the mid­dle class means for­get­ting about poverty, but it’s the other side of the coin.” Global de­mand for African com­modi­ties, driven by China, has also boosted eco­nomic growth along with strong in­vest­ment in pro­duc­tive in­dus­tries and in­fra­struc­ture. The World Bank fore­cast for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa will reach $54 bil­lion (R491bn) by 2015, up from $37.7bn in 2012.

za,Saturday Star,20140531,Trip to China de­layed by poorly trained per­son­nel,"MY STORY is not a hor­ror story, but is now the rea­son I al­ways feel a lit­tle ner­vous when I travel. I in­tended to travel to China to be a guest of the Chi­nese govern­ment hold­ing an in­ter­na­tional re­new­able en­ergy meet­ing in mid2000 and was to fly with Cathay Pa­cific. I had a Chi­nese visa in my tem­po­rary pass­port, which had been given to me by the Chi­nese govern­ment a few days pre­vi­ously. My new pass­port was be­ing pre­pared. In those days pass­ports took longer to re­new and tem­po­rary pass­ports were quite ac­cept­able. The Cathay Pa­cific per­son at check-in re­fused to al­low me to board the flight, say­ing that the pass­port did not have enough pages, which was not true, it did, it had quite a few pages left. I went to Home Af­fairs that day and got my new pass­port, which was ready, and re­turned the next day to take the same flight. I was told my visa was valid even if it was in an­other pass­port, so I could travel with the new pass­port and the old tem­po­rary one with the visa. To test if the Cathay Pa­cific per­son’s re­fusal to al­low me to board was truly com­pany pol­icy, I pre­sented my tem­po­rary pass­port to the per­son at check-in on my sec­ond at­tempt to travel to China and it was ac­cepted with­out a blink. I then flew to China on my tem­po­rary pass­port, never tak­ing my new one out of my bag. No one blinked an eye, it was all ap­proved. How­ever, I missed my op­portu- nity to present to an in­ter­na­tional meet­ing on the im­por­tant is­sue of gen­der, en­ergy and poverty, which I think was a loss for the work we do here in South Africa. I wrote to Cathay Pa­cific af­ter­wards ask­ing them to ad­dress this is­sue and they wrote back say­ing they did not think they did any­thing wrong, but they did not do a thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tion, as they did not ask to see my pass­port, nor did they even call to speak to me. As ex­pected I have never flown Cathay Pa­cific again and I warn people of my ex­pe­ri­ences with Cathay Pa­cific by telling them this story. As I and my staff travel more than 200 times a year, I am cer­tain that this must have had a dent or im­pact of some kind, and this is sim­ply the only sat­is­fac­tion I have de­rived from what I think was ap­palling treat­ment by an air­line and poorly trained per­son­nel.

za,The Star Late Edition,20150730,In­dia’s pop­u­la­tion forecast to top China’s,"IN­DIA, the world’s largest democ­racy, is about to tip the global pop­u­la­tion scales as the UN’s latest pop­u­la­tion es­ti­mates show that the coun­try is poised to sur­pass China by 2022 in pop­u­la­tion size. The shift, when it oc­curs, will be seis­mic as it will en­tail geopo­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and so­cial im­pli­ca­tions for the world. In a re­port re­leased yesterday, en­ti­tled “World Pop­u­la­tion Prospects: The 2015 Re­vi­sion”, the UN forecast the world’s pop­u­la­tion to reach 8.5 bil­lion by 2030 from the cur­rent 7.3 bil­lion. The UN did not ex­pect any let up in pop­u­la­tion growth be­yond 2030. It fore­casts the world’s pop­u­la­tion to keep climb­ing, reach­ing 9.7 bil­lion by 2050 and 11.2 bil­lion in 2100. Pop­u­la­tion growth is a hot­but­ton is­sue as it presents gov­ern­ments and pol­i­cy­mak­ers with the chal­lenge of how to deal with com­pe­ti­tion for food, shel­ter and other re­sources. “Un­der­stand­ing the de­mo­graphic changes that are likely to un­fold over the com­ing years, as well as the chal­lenges and op­por­tu­ni­ties that they present for achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, is key to the de­sign and im­ple­men­ta­tion of the new de­vel­op­ment agenda,” Wu Hongbo, UN Un­der-Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral for Eco­nomic and So­cial Af­fairs, said. Africa was ex­pected to ac­count for more than half of the world’s pop­u­la­tion growth be­tween 2015 and 2050, thanks to the con­ti­nent’s high­est rate of pop­u­la­tion growth. Dur­ing this pe­riod, the pop­u­la­tions of 28 African coun­tries are pro­jected to more than dou­ble, and by 2100, 10 African coun­tries are pro­jected to have in­creased by at least a fac­tor of five: An­gola, Bu­rundi, Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic of Congo, Malawi, Mali, Niger, So­ma­lia, Uganda, United Re­pub­lic of Tan­za­nia and Zam­bia. In a re­port re­leased yesterday, the UN forecast the world’s pop­u­la­tion to reach 8.5 bil­lion by 2030… “The con­cen­tra­tion of pop­u­la­tion growth in the poor­est coun­tries presents its own set of chal­lenges, mak­ing it more dif­fi­cult to erad­i­cate poverty and in­equal­ity, to com­bat hunger and malnutrition, and to ex­pand ed­u­ca­tional en­rol­ment and health sys­tems, all of which are cru­cial to the suc­cess of the new sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment agenda,” John Wil­moth, the di­rec­tor of the pop­u­la­tion di­vi­sion in the UN’s De­part- ment of Eco­nomic and So­cial Af­fairs, said in a state­ment ac­com­pa­ny­ing the re­lease of the es­ti­mates. The UN said most of the pro­jected in­crease in the world’s pop­u­la­tion could be at­trib­uted to a short list of high-fer­til­ity coun­tries, mainly in Africa, or coun­tries with al­ready large pop­u­la­tions. Dur­ing 2015-2050, half of the world’s pop­u­la­tion growth is ex­pected to be con­cen­trated in nine coun­tries: In­dia, Nige­ria, Pak­istan, Demo­cratic Re­pub­lic of the Congo, Ethiopia, United Re­pub­lic of Tan­za­nia, the US, In­done­sia and Uganda (listed ac­cord­ing to the size of their con­tri­bu­tion to to­tal growth). Youth­ful Africa China and In­dia re­main the two largest coun­tries in the world, each with more than 1 bil­lion peo­ple, rep­re­sent­ing 19 and 18 per­cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, re­spec­tively. But by 2022, the pop­u­la­tion of In­dia was ex­pected to sur­pass that of China, the re­port said. The de­mo­graphic div­i­dend of hav­ing a youth­ful pop­u­la­tion has been cited as one of Africa’s most en­dur­ing at­trac­tions to in­vestors, pro­vided that eco­nomic growth rates con­tinue to lift many more peo­ple out of poverty and boost the ranks of the mid­dle class. So, while there was some de­gree of un­cer­tainty sur­round- ing any pro­jec­tion, the large num­ber of young peo­ple in Africa, who would reach adult­hood in the com­ing years and start hav­ing chil­dren of their own, en­sured that the re­gion would play a cen­tral role in shap­ing the size and dis­tri­bu­tion of the world’s pop­u­la­tion over the com­ing decades, the UN said. Most of the in­crease could be at­trib­uted to high-fer­til­ity na­tions or those with al­ready large pop­u­la­tions. In Africa, chil­dren un­der the age 15 ac­count for 41 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion in 2015 and young per­sons aged 15 to 24 ac­count for a fur­ther 19 per­cent. Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean, and Asia, which have seen greater declines in fer­til­ity, have smaller per­cent­ages of chil­dren (26 and 24 per­cent, re­spec­tively) and sim­i­lar per­cent­ages of youth (17 and 16 per­cent, re­spec­tively). In to­tal, these three re­gions are home to 1.7 bil­lion chil­dren and 1.1 bil­lion young per­sons. “These chil­dren and young peo­ple are fu­ture work­ers and par­ents, who can help to build a brighter fu­ture for their coun­tries,” the UN said. “Pro­vid­ing them with health care, ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, par­tic­u­larly in the poor­est coun­tries and groups, will be a crit­i­cal fo­cus of the new sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment agenda,” it added. Among the 10 largest coun­tries in the world, one is in Africa (Nige­ria), five are in Asia (Bangladesh, China, In­dia, In­done­sia, and Pak­istan), two are in Latin Amer­ica (Brazil and Mexico), one is in North­ern Amer­ica (US), and one is in Europe (Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion). UN re­port Of these, Nige­ria’s pop­u­la­tion, cur­rently the sev­enth largest in the world, is grow­ing the most rapidly. “Con­se­quently, the pop­u­la­tion of Nige­ria is pro­jected to sur­pass that of the US by about 2050, at which point it would be­come the third largest coun­try in the world,” the UN said. By 2050, six coun­tries are ex­pected to ex­ceed 300 mil­lion: China, In­dia, In­done­sia, Nige­ria, Pak­istan, and the US. The UN’s latest re­port is the 24th round of of­fi­cial UN pop­u­la­tion es­ti­mates and pro­jec­tions that have been pre­pared by the pop­u­la­tion di­vi­sion of the UN Depart­ment of Eco­nomic and So­cial Af­fairs.

za,Sunday Tribune,20140112,Jobs core is­sue for ANC elec­torate,"THE ANC’S fo­cus in its elec­tion man­i­festo on job cre­ation and the econ­omy was likely to lead to all sorts of pos­tur­ing about ef­fi­ciency and de­liv­ery by the gov­ern­ment, econ­o­mists and po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mists pre­dicted. But they have warned that en­trenched eco­nomic struc­tural prob­lems – a grow­ing trade im­bal­ance, a likely grow­ing fis­cal deficit, a poorly ed­u­cated work­force and a fur­ther weak­en­ing rand – were likely to re­duce the man­i­festo to an ex­pres­sion of good in­ten­tions. Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma was due to is­sue the ANC man­i­festo in Mpumalanga yes­ter­day af­ter the na­tional ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee (NEC) of the gov­ern­ing party fine-tuned its de­tails ear­lier in the week. The man­i­festo, on which the party will fight the up­com­ing na­tional elec­tion cam­paign dur­ing which Par­lia­ment and the nine pro­vin­cial leg­is­la­tures will be elected, would fo­cus on jobs and the econ­omy, sec­re­tary-gen­eral Gwede Man­tashe an­nounced be­fore it was due to be of­fi­cially re­leased. It was “a con­tin­u­a­tion of the work we have been do­ing”, he said. The ANC said it would fo­cus once again on the five key ar­eas on which it had fought the 2009 elec­tion when Zuma was elected to power. At that point, the ANC gained just short of a two-thirds ma­jor­ity. The five key ar­eas were the cre­ation of de­cent work and sus­tain­able liveli­hoods, ed­u­ca­tion, health, crime, ru­ral de­vel­op­ment, in­clud­ing land re­form, along with food pro­duc­tion and se­cu­rity. The party said then, and is say­ing again, that the ma­jor chal­lenges fac­ing so­ci­ety were high un­em­ploy­ment – with the em­pha­sis fall­ing this time on dan­ger­ously high lev­els of work­less young peo­ple – as well as poverty, deep­en­ing in­equal­ity and ru­ral marginal­i­sa­tion. Mike Schus­sler of Econ­o­mists.co.za said he hoped that the elec­tion fo­cus would be on build­ing small busi­nesses and mak­ing it eas­ier for en­trepreneurs to flour­ish. “I re­call that the ANC came to power for the first time in 1994 with the (elec­tion) poster: Jobs, jobs, jobs.” Un­for­tu­nately that prom­ise had never been put into ac­tion, al­though it had in var­i­ous ways been re­peated in all three na­tional elec­tions since then, Schus­sler noted. While he wel­comed the re­newed com­mit­ment to a youth wage sub­sidy – a fact of much op­po­si­tion from the ANC’s al­liance part­ners in Cosatu, he said this was un­likely to make a huge dent on un­em­ploy­ment. De­vel­op­ment Plan, “which has to be seen to be the eco­nomic vi­sion the rul­ing party has for South Africa”. How­ever, while the sen­ti­ments would be good and the ANC would pledge al­le­giance to im­prov­ing ser­vice de­liv­ery and gov­ern­ment ef­fi­ciency, a rapid change to the cir­cum­stances of the poor and un­em­ployed was un­likely, Gar­row ar­gued. While the gov­ern­ing party – which is ex­pected to win a fifth five-year term, al­beit with a re­duced ma­jor­ity – will fo­cus on un­em­ploy­ment among the youth, in­come in­equal­ity and poverty, “they will be preach­ing about eco­nomic vi­sions yet know­ing they can’t achieve them”. Schus­sler said the grow­ing trade im­bal­ance with im­ports out­strip­ping ex­ports was un­likely to change. “We could see the rand at R13 to the US dol­lar within two years eas­ily… it may even reach R15.” This, to­gether with a poorly ed­u­cated work­force would con­strain the ANC’s am­bi­tions of achiev­ing job-cre­at­ing high eco­nomic growth, re­duc­ing poverty and in­equal­ity, he said. Steven Fried­man, a po­lit­i­cal econ­o­mist from the Univer­sity of Jo­han­nes­burg, said man­i­festoes were sup­posed to gloss over fault-lines. Thus he was “per­plexed” that it fo­cused on job cre­ation and the econ­omy, which were dif­fi­cult ar­eas of de­liv­ery for the ANC. THE RAND climbed from a five-year low and bonds strength­ened for the first time in three days af­ter US pay­rolls rose less than fore­cast last month and data showed Chi­nese im­ports ac­cel­er­ated. US em­ploy­ers hired 74 000 work­ers last month, trail­ing the 197 000 fore­cast in a sur­vey of econ­o­mists and cast­ing doubt on the strength of the econ­omy as the Fed­eral Re­serve (Fed) re­duces the stim­u­lus that helped fuel de­mand for South African bonds. China’s im­ports rose the most in five months in De­cem­ber, in­di­cat­ing that do­mes­tic de­mand will sup­port growth. “We have to keep an eye on the US and… China, be­cause the rand is be­ing driven by global fac­tors,” Ion de Vleeschauwer at Bid­vest Bank said. The rand firmed to R10.7055 a dol­lar by 5.30pm in Jo­han­nes­burg, stronger than Thurs­day’s 5pm bid, but re­treat­ing from a bid of R10.6696 at 5pm on Fri­day. Yields on bench­mark rand bonds due De­cem­ber 2026 fell. The Fed said last month that it would ta­per bond buy­ing to $75 bil­lion (R809bn) a month from $85bn. They are ex­pected to re­duce pur­chases in $10bn in­cre­ments over the next seven meet­ings be­fore end­ing them in De­cem­ber, the sur­vey shows. China’s trade data showed in­bound ship­ments in­creased 8.3 per­cent from a year ear­lier, beat­ing the me­dian es­ti­mate for 5 per­cent growth. – Bloomberg",南非
za,The Sunday Independent,20100905,"The Bric na­tions – Brazil, Rus­sia,In­dia and China – hold the key to a bet­ter life for all in SA","ITHIN a pe­riod of 12 months, Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma has vis­ited Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia and China, fa­mously known as the Bric na­tions. Last week’s state visit to China (the last of the Bric na­tions to be vis­ited by the pres­i­dent) was there­fore a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone in South Africa’s po­si­tion­ing in global af­fairs which are in a con­stant, if not chaotic, state of flux. The cen­tre of grav­ity in global com­mer­cial and eco­nomic af­fairs is shift­ing away from the West to­wards the Bric coun­tries and other emerg­ing mar­kets. Pre­to­ria has to ad­just to that shift. Lead­ers of these coun­tries have. Their com­pa­nies are in­creas­ing their fo­cus on in­tra-Bric and emerg­ing mar­ket trade and in­vest­ment with the as­sis­tance of their gov­ern­ments. The fact that South African busi­ness lead­ers have taken a keen in­ter­est in be­ing part of Zuma’s del­e­ga­tions to these coun­tries is a good sign. South Africa can pro­vide a bet­ter life for all if our com­pa­nies are glob­ally com­pet­i­tive. Coun­tries are as good as their com­pa­nies. Com­pa­nies are in­sep­a­ra­ble from their coun­tries of ori­gin. It makes per­fect sense for govern­ment and busi­ness to have a com­mon strate­gic ap­proach on glob­al­i­sa­tion and how best to lever­age it as a force for value cre­ation. The brave new world of the 21st cen­tury de­mands brave new ideas and com­pelling vi­sions of the fu­ture. Busi­ness in South Africa re­quires a clearly thought-out and ar­tic­u­lated vi­sion of the fu­ture with clear pa­ram­e­ters and am­bi­tions for tak­ing on the world on the com­mer­cial bat­tles of the 21st cen­tury. Zuma’s busi­ness del­e­ga­tions have been very im­pres­sive, a sign that busi­ness is ral­ly­ing around Pre­to­ria for­eign pol­icy moves and am­bi­tions. How­ever, more clar­ity is re­quired to con­sol­i­date and deepen gains in Wac­cess­ing in­vest­ment and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties off­shore. There is more that we can and in­deed must do to move with speed in tak­ing on the rest of the world in the com­pet­i­tive bat­tles of the 21st cen­tury. Coun­tries like Brazil, In­dia and China are light years ahead of us on how govern­ment and busi­ness work to­gether to ac­cess in­vest­ment, pro­cure­ment and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties for home com­pa­nies. Zuma and Deputy Pres­i­dent Kgalema Mot­lanthe have con­founded scep­tics by be­ing at­tuned to the re­al­i­ties of glob­al­i­sa­tion and the strate­gic im­per­a­tive of ad­vanc­ing the na­tional eco­nomic in­ter­est at home and be­yond. They have con­tin­ued to push Pre­to­ria’s views on the in­ter­na­tional arena. South Africa has also po­si­tioned it­self well as a le­git­i­mate voice of the de­vel­op­ing world. Our abil­ity to ac­cess in­vest­ment, pro­cure­ment and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties off­shore will de­ter­mine the ex­tent to which do­mes­tic chal­lenges such as poverty, un­em­ploy­ment and crime are ef­fec­tively dealt with.

za,The Mercury,20101208,Peace breaks out in Can­cun,"IT MAY not last, but a spirit of com­pro­mise seems to have set­tled over the an­nual UN cli­mate con­fer­ence as ne­go­tia­tors en­ter the fi­nal days look­ing for agree­ments on sec­ondary tools for cop­ing with global warm­ing. The open snip­ing be­tween the US and China that marked pe­ri­odic talks ear­lier this year was not in ev­i­dence on Mon­day as the sec­ond week of the meet­ing got un­der way. “There were heated dis­cus­sions at Copen­hagen. Here the at­mos­phere is rel­a­tively mild,” China’s cli­mate chief, Xie Zhen­hua, said. He was re­fer­ring to the in­tense talks in the Dan­ish cap­i­tal last De­cem­ber that failed to pro­duce a hoped-for bind­ing pact re­quir­ing sub­stan­tial cuts in emis­sions of car­bon diox­ide and other in­dus­trial, agri­cul­tural and trans­port gases blamed for global warm­ing. No such over­all emis­sions deal is ex­pected at the ne­go­ti­a­tions un­der the UN cli­mate treaty, where en­vi­ron­ment min­is­ters and other ne­go­tia­tors from the 193 treaty na­tions are to wrap up their talks on Fri­day. They are aim­ing to reach agree­ments on is­sues like lay­ing the ground­work for a “green fund” of $100 bil­lion (R688bn) a year by 2020. Fi­nanced by richer na­tions, the fund would sup­port poorer na­tions in con­vert­ing to cleaner en­ergy sources and in adapt­ing to a shift­ing cli­mate that might dam­age agri­cul­ture, peo­ple’s health and economies. Can­cun’s spirit of com­pro­mise may be most needed in the com­ing days’ de­bates over limited ges­tures pro­posed in the area of emis­sion re­duc­tions. The US has long re­fused to join the rest of the in­dus­tri­alised world in the Ky­oto Pro­to­col, a 1997 add-on to the cli­mate treaty that re­quires mod­est emis­sion re­duc­tions by richer na­tions, and whose com­mit­ments ex­pire in 2012. The US com­plained that Ky­oto would hurt its econ­omy and should have re­quired ac­tions as well by such emerg­ing economies as China and In­dia. For their part, those poorer but grow­ing na­tions have re­jected calls that they sub­mit to Ky­oto-style legally bind­ing com­mit­ments – not to re­duce emis­sions, but to cut back on emis­sion growth. Their first obli­ga­tion, these gov­ern­ments say, is to de­velop their economies, not hob­ble them. “We still have 150 mil­lion peo­ple un­der the poverty line,” Xie said. In a non-bind­ing Copen­hagen ac­cord, an agree­ment not ac­cepted by all treaty par­ties, the US and other in­dus­trial na­tions an­nounced tar­gets for re­duc­ing emis­sions by 2020, and China and oth­ers set goals for cut­ting back on the growth of their emis­sions. Many par­ties now want to have those vol­un­tary tar­gets “an­chored” more for­mally in a doc­u­ment emerg­ing from the Can­cun talks.

For many of us, get­ting out of our com­fort zone and see­ing how the rest of the world lives is a form of es­capism. It brings us down to earth to ap­pre­ci­ate the com­mu­ni­ties just out of our reach and the re­al­i­ties they face ev­ery day. The real ques­tion is, what is eth­i­cal and re­spon­si­ble when deal­ing with tours or ex­pe­ri­ences of this na­ture? Is it giv­ing hu­man­ity a glimpse into the lives of the poor?

za,Popular Mechanics (South Africa),20180901,THE CHINA FAC­TOR,"Here’s the thing about de­vel­op­ing mar­kets: At some stage, you just stop de­vel­op­ing. The Chi­nese con­sumer mar­ket has ma­tured, and the coun­try now needs to find its own China to keep up with con­sumer de­mand, and off­set labour costs for the ex­port mar­ket. Luck­ily for them (and us), there’s an en­tire con­ti­nent made up of de­vel­op­ing mar­kets that is in des­per­ate need of jobs, hos­pi­tals and schools to help lift them­selves out of poverty. Africa is also rich in nat­u­ral re­sources, and the global rules the world is try­ing to force China to com­ply with don’t re­ally ap­ply to our con­ti­nent. In 1971, the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly voted on which govern­ment would rep­re­sent China. The US op­posed the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China and was sup­ported by much of the African con­ti­nent – the PRC won the vote and has rep­re­sented China ever since. When the Gen­eral Assem­bly was called in 2007 to de­cide on what should be done about hu­man-rights vi­o­la­tions in North Korea, China re­ceived the back­ing of the bulk of Africa. Why the turn­around in vot­ing al­le­giance? Two words: Eco­nomic in­flu­ence. Rail net­works in Kenya and Addis Ababa, hy­dro­elec­tric­ity in Guinea and now a mas­sive au­to­mo­tive pro­duc­tion plant in South Africa’s Coega in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment zone in Port El­iz­a­beth – China is tak­ing up the risky in­vest­ments no other coun­try is will­ing to touch. And this is all Africa needs to get its foot in the eco­nomic- de­vel­op­ment door. The hid­den clause to these low- or no-in­ter­est loans and for­eign in­vest­ments is two-fold. On one hand, China is stack­ing its global in­flu­ence so it can win de­ci­sive votes – like those that could bring eco­nomic harm to its global part­ners – and on the other, it buys in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity. Years of dou­ble- digit eco­nomic growth have seen the Chi­nese pop­u­la­tion tran­si­tion into a mid­dle- class so­ci­ety through im­prove­ments in their ed­u­ca­tion and work­ing con­di­tions. When ev­ery­one wants to be an en­gi­neer, you’ll sud­denly find your­self lack­ing a labour force, and when cheap labour was your stock-in-trade, you’ll sud­denly find your­self with a big prob­lem. You need look no fur­ther than the trade ac­tiv­ity be­tween China and Africa for ev­i­dence of the deep in­flu­ence. In 2016, that trade of goods equated to $128 bn, and it con­tin­ues to rise. In­vest­ment, how­ever, has been quite flat, with $12 bn in loans and for­eign aid com­ing from China in 2015, along with $3 bn in in­vest­ment across the whole con­ti­nent. The Beijing Au­to­mo­tive In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion (BAIC) plant in the Eastern Cape saw the first semi­knock­down (SKD) car roll off its assem­bly line on 24 July 2018. We were in at­ten­dance at the gala event at the plant, which in­cluded a live stream to Pre­to­ria, where Pres­i­dents Ramaphosa and Jin­ping pressed the but­ton for a BAIC X25 to be wheeled out on stage. This gala hap­pened on the eve of the 10th an­nual BRICS sum­mit in Joburg, and it was clear that the build­ings we were stand­ing in had a tough dead­line. When com­pleted, the R11 bn fa­cil­ity will rep­re­sent the largest Chi­nese in­vest­ment into Africa. This plant is also the first of four global head­quar­ters that are the fo­cus of BAIC’S in­ter­na­tional ex­pan­sion. Mex­ico and In­dia rep­re­sent the gate­way to the Amer­i­cas and the sub­con­ti­nent, while South Africa is the gate­way into Africa. Fur­ther ex­pan­sion in greater China will ser­vice the Asian mar­ket. Cur­rently the PE plant is as­sem­bling SKD units of the X25, with a bakkie and SUV go­ing into pro­duc­tion in the near fu­ture. The goal is to have 60 per cent lo­cal pro­duc­tion done on-site, with a panel-stamp­ing shop and sup­plier park be­ing added in phase three of de­vel­op­ment. By 2019, the plant is set to have cre­ated around 1 400 jobs, ris­ing to 2 500 when the project is com­plete. Pro­duc­tion es­ti­mates are at 100 000 units per year. In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion chair­per­son Busi Mabusa at­tended the event and con­firmed that those job to­tals un­for­tu­nately in­clude the con­struc­tion jobs that will be­come re­dun­dant once the plant is com­plete. Al­though the tem­po­rary em­ploy­ment is much needed in the com­mu­nity, it does in­flate the job- cre­ation im­pact by al­most 50 per cent. A hefty sum by any­one’s count. BAIC has pledged to achieve 90–95 per cent lo­cal em­ploy­ment from the com­mu­nity and will also of­fer train­ing at an academy on-site. These skills will also be trans­fer­able to the other plants in the area, such as FAW just across the high­way.",南非

Amaz­ingly, two of the most im­por­tant of them were ac­tu­ally achieved years ago. In 2000 world lead­ers de­clared their in­ten­tion to erad­i­cate ex­treme poverty and hunger – in con­crete terms, to halve the global pro­por­tion of those liv­ing on $1 (later re­vised to $1.25) per day, by 2015. The goal was reached five years early, in 2010. Again, eco­nomic growth in China and parts of Africa played a ma­jor role in reach­ing that tar­get – but the MDGs fo­cused laser-like at­ten­tion on the is­sue. Some of the goals, how­ever, are very far from be­ing achieved. Fifty-seven mil­lion chil­dren get no pri­mary ed­u­ca­tion. Gen­der in­equal­ity and vi­o­lence against women re­main en­trenched in many coun­tries. As the dead­line for achiev­ing th­ese goals ap­proaches, the pic­ture there­fore is a very mixed one. Yet taken over­all the idea of set­ting th­ese clear, sim­ple, am­bi­tious goals, agreed by the world com­mu­nity, has been vin­di­cated.",南非
za,Sowetan,20120517,GO BACK TO BA­SICS,"THE ANC should strive to cre­ate a dif­fer­ent iden­tity to that of the DA, Cosatu gen­eral sec­re­tary Zwelinz­ima Vavi warned yes­ter­day. “The ANC must, in pos­ture and pol­icy, be dif­fer­ent to the DA. The DA is our class en­emy. We hope we will go back to ba­sics when the ANC holds its pol­icy con­fer­ence.” He cited as sim­i­lar­i­ties the two par­ties’ stance on is­sues like labour bro­kers and youth wage sub­sidy. Vavi blamed ANC blun­ders which he said con­trib­uted and mo­ti­vated the DA to march against Cosatu to protest against the labour fed­er­a­tion’s stance on youth wage sub­sidy. “The DA seeks to cap­i­talise on the mis­takes and own goals some in the lead­er­ship score, in­clud­ing such blun­ders as is the case with [Lieu­tenant-gen­eral] Md­luli who is fac­ing se­ri­ous ac­cu­sa­tions,” he said. Vavi said most black peo­ple who were part of the DA march to Cosatu house were des­per­ate and bit­ter be­cause of their con­di­tions in the town­ships. “These were not only hired and ill-in­formed African youths but they rep­re­sent the face of des­per­a­tion of the part of the youth who con­sti­tute 72% of the un­em­ployed,” he said. “In the DA march you could hardly count the num­bers of white males, it was mainly African youth. “Re­mem­ber, an empty stom­ach has no logic or ra­tio­nal­ity, no sense of his­tory or com­plex­i­ties.” Vavi was ad­dress­ing Cosatu’s in­ter­na­tional pol­icy con­fer­ence in Kemp­ton Park yes­ter­day. Vavi said de­spite the fact that some na­tions of the world were trapped in poverty some were spend­ing big on lux­u­ri­ous items. Vavi cau­tioned about the na­ture of the re­la­tion­ship South Africa and the en­tire con­ti­nent forms with China. “Many have called this [re­la­tion­ship] a new type of colo­nial­ism, mean­ing that China is re­plac­ing Europe in the coloni­sa­tion drive.”",南非
za,The Citizen (KZN),20130621,Grav­ity of les­son from space,"BEI­JING – A Chi­nese astro­naut or­bit­ing more than 300km above the Earth’s sur­face de­liv­ered a video class to chil­dren across the coun­try yes­ter­day, state tele­vi­sion showed in a live broad­cast. Wear­ing a blue space suit, Wang Yap­ing, the sec­ond Chi­nese woman in space, demon­strated how a va­ri­ety of ob­jects – from a bub­ble of wa­ter to a spin­ning toy – be­have in zero grav­ity. Wang’s class – de­liv­ered from China’s or­bit­ing space mod­ule Tian­gong-1 – was shown in class­rooms across China, state broad­caster CCTV said. The astro­naut smiled as she pushed a fel­low astro­naut into the wall of the mod­ule with the mer­est touch of her fin­ger, and went on to gulp down a drop of wa­ter as it floated in mid air. Us­ing a live video link, Wang fired ques­tions at stu­dents who gath­ered at a school in Bei­jing to watch the les­son on a gi­ant screen. More than 60 mil­lion stu­dents and teach­ers were ex­pected to watch the class, the state-run China Daily said. “In space ... how can we tell if we have be­come thin­ner or fat­ter?” she asked stu­dents, with a red Chi­nese flag vis­i­ble be­hind her. “We can use elec­tric scales,” one ea­ger young boy replied, dressed in a white shirt and the red scarf of the young pi­o­neers, a youth or­gan­i­sa­tion run by China’s rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party. “I re­ally envy you for be­ing able to teach us a les­son while float­ing in space,” a fe­male stu­dent said. “Have you seen any space junk?” an­other stu­dent asked Wang, be­fore she replied: “We haven’t seen any, but it does ex­ist.” The les­son cov­ered top­ics in physics in­clud­ing Isaac New­ton’s sec­ond law of mo­tion, and the sur­face ten­sion of wa­ter. China launched three as­tro­nauts into space on the Shen­zhou-10 craft last week. The craft later docked with the Tian­gong-1 in a test in­tended to pre­pare China to build its own per­ma­nent space sta­tion. The Chi­nese as­tro­nauts went to space with spe­cially pre­pared bags of lemon tea, and work out on ex­er­cise bikes, a video shown be­fore the les­son re­vealed. China first sent a hu­man into space only in 2003 and its ca­pa­bil­i­ties still lag be­hind the US and Rus­sia. But its pro­gramme is highly am­bi­tious and in­cludes plans to build a sta­tion or­bit­ing Earth by 2020, and land a man on the moon. Bei­jing sees its multi-bil­lion-dol­lar space pro­gramme as a sym­bol of its ris­ing global stature, grow­ing tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise, and the Com­mu­nist Party’s suc­cess in turn­ing around the for­tunes of the once poverty-stricken na­tion. The pro­ject is heav­ily pro­moted to the do­mes­tic au­di­ence, and state broad­caster CCTV ran the les­son in full on its pre­mier chan­nel.",南非
za,Cape Times,20200103,"On Jan­uary 1, 2020, Pres­i­dent of China Me­dia Group, Shen Haixiong, de­liv­ers a New Year mes­sage to over­seas au­di­ences via China Ra­dio In­ter­na­tional and on­line.","Dear friends, 2020 is an aus­pi­cious and happy num­ber. This is be­cause its Chi­nese pro­nun­ci­a­tion has the same ring as “Ai Ni Ai Ni,” mean­ing “love you love you.” On this New Year’s Day, I would like to ex­tend to you my best wishes from Bei­jing on be­half of China Me­dia Group. The his­tory of hu­man­ity is a record of one sig­nif­i­cant mo­ment af­ter an­other. 2019 had many such mo­ments, which have be­come our in­deli­ble mem­o­ries. On Oc­to­ber 1st, we cel­e­brated the 70th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China. To­gether, we en­joyed au­dio-visual feasts that charted the ex­tra­or­di­nary jour­ney of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic over the past 70 years, through works pro­duced by China Me­dia Group such as the mul­ti­lin­gual doc­u­men­tary “His­toric Jour­ney”, and the 4K ul­tra-high def­i­ni­tion film, “When China Wows the World: The 2019 Grand Mil­i­tary Pa­rade”, made from our live broad­casts. I have also re­ceived many sin­cere wishes sent by you, our friends around the world. I re­mem­ber get­ting an email from Ital­ian China ex­pert, Francesco Marin­gio, in which he said, “I would like to ap­plaud the bril­liant achieve­ments made in the 70 years since the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China. I think the Chi­nese peo­ple have ev­ery rea­son to be proud.” Over the past year, we have tried hard to cap­ture each of China’s marvelous mo­ments as it made its way for­ward. We’ve strived to present a true, multi-di­men­sional, and panoramic view of China in this new era. Us­ing the lat­est broad­cast­ing tech­nol­ogy, such as 5G net­works, 4K and 8K video, and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, we brought you cov­er­age of ma­jor events such as the sec­ond Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion, the Con­fer­ence on Di­a­logue of Asian Civ­i­liza­tions, and the cel­e­bra­tion of the 20th an­niver­sary of Ma­cao’s re­turn to China. Our mul­ti­lin­gual video se­ries, in­clud­ing “Clas­sics Quoted by Xi” and “Ev­ery Trea­sure Tells a Story”, opened one win­dow af­ter an­other for you to gain an in-depth un­der­stand­ing of China’s mod­ern-day val­ues and ideas as well as its long his­tory and rich cul­ture. We also hosted in­no­va­tive in­ter­ac­tive events to mark the 70th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic and 70 years of diplo­matic ties be­tween China and Rus­sia, and we in­tro­duced you to our new livestream­ing stars. By reach­ing out to our au­di­ence in this way, we have gained even more over­seas friends who are in­ter­ested in China. Although China Me­dia Group was es­tab­lished only two years ago, we are fully aware that in the In­ter­net age, it’s not enough to just make progress. If you don’t move quickly, you’ll soon fall be­hind. Bearing in mind Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s man­date to in­no­vate and to make good use of the op­por­tu­ni­ties pro­vided by new me­dia, we are speed­ing up our ef­forts to be­come a new kind of world-class main­stream me­dia or­ga­ni­za­tion, one that is driven by in­no­va­tion. In 2019, we opened China’s only na­tional key lab­o­ra­tory for ul­tra­high def­i­ni­tion video and au­dio. We launched a user-friendly 5G au­dio-visual new me­dia plat­form called “Yang­shipin”. And we be­gan to air more than 200 new high-qual­ity pro­grams, as we strived to pro­vide you with bright, ex­cit­ing, and in­spir­ing pro­duc­tions. We have al­ways ad­hered to the prin­ci­ple of re­port­ing on ma­jor events in a com­pre­hen­sive, ob­jec­tive, and im­par­tial way. We con­duct ex­changes with our coun­ter­parts at home and abroad on the ba­sis of equal­ity and with an open-minded and co­op­er­a­tive at­ti­tude. Over the past year, I have talked with ex­ec­u­tives from over 150 in­ter­na­tional me­dia or­ga­ni­za­tions, in­clud­ing the As­so­ci­ated Press, Reuters, Agence France Presse, and the Bri­tish Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion. We have found more and more com­mon ground, and ex­panded our cir­cle of friends. That said, I re­gret to see that some sec­tions of the West­ern me­dia have seemed to suf­fer from “se­lec­tive blind­ness” when cov­er­ing some events re­lated to China. Some have even pub­lished hearsay and ru­mors as news, re­sult­ing in dis­tor­tions and in­ac­cu­ra­cies. Some of these sto­ries are as fan­ci­ful as nov­els. We all be­lieve that facts are the lifeblood of jour­nal­ism, and that re­ly­ing on imag­i­na­tion to pro­duce news does se­ri­ous harm to the me­dia’s cred­i­bil­ity with the public. Ev­ery ex­ec­u­tive of the news in­dus­try should be vig­i­lant in ad­her­ing to the ethics of our pro­fes­sion. As the 18th cen­tury Bri­tish es­say­ist Wil­liam Ha­zlitt once said, “Prej­u­dice is the child of ig­no­rance.” Pur­su­ing truth and elim­i­nat­ing prej­u­dice is com­mend­able work. China Me­dia Group will con­tinue to take an ob­jec­tive and im­par­tial stand to report the truth to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, and to be a voice of jus­tice in the world. More than 1,200 years ago, the Tang Dy­nasty poet, Zhang Ji­ul­ing, wrote, “Dis­tance can­not sep­a­rate true friends who feel close even though they are thousands of leagues apart.” We’re lucky to be able to meet and to know each other on this planet. When I vis­ited Brazil and Ar­gentina, I was de­lighted to see that the jacaranda and bougainvil­lea they have there are the same as the ones I saw when I worked in Guang­dong Prov­ince, and our cat­birds have the same call. In Italy and Spain, I tried rice wine and ham that taste sim­i­lar to what you can find in my home­town in Zhe­jiang Prov­ince. In these mo­ments, the idea of the “global vil­lage” feels so con­crete and real. There’s no rea­son why the res­i­dents of our global vil­lage shouldn’t com­mu­ni­cate and min­gle. I’ve al­ways be­lieved that ex­changes be­tween mem­bers of the me­dia can re­move mis­un­der­stand­ings and prej­u­dice, and turn more peo­ple into friends. 2020 marks the end of the de­ci­sive phase of the work to build China into a moder­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects. It’s also the year when our coun­try, with its pop­u­la­tion of 1.4 bil­lion, will elim­i­nate ab­so­lute poverty, an achieve­ment that will be un­prece­dented in hu­man his­tory. By up­hold­ing a pro­fes­sional stan­dard de­fined by con­stant im­prove­ment and the pur­suit of per­fec­tion, China Me­dia Group will con­tinue to record the sig­nif­i­cant mo­ments of our time, as it brings you the sto­ries that mat­ter from China and the rest of the world, and pro­vides more pos­i­tive en­ergy for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for hu­man­ity. May there be love ev­ery­where in the world in 2020! I give my best wishes to China, to the world, and to all of you!",南非
za,Daily Dispatch,20200107,Wel­come to the decade of un­ease,"Oh boy! Wel­come to the 2020s. Should we start with the bad news or the worst news? Per­haps we’ll start with a lit­tle re­flec­tion. Re­mem­ber 1999 and the eu­pho­ria with which we wel­comed the new mil­len­nium around the world? The only panic on our minds was about the so-called “Y2K” com­puter er­ror col­lapse. Do you still re­mem­ber Y2K? But so op­ti­mistic were we about the turn to the 2000s that we par­tied away 1999. I spent New Year’s night of 1999/2000 on the streets some­where in Dur­ban city cen­tre with friends, barely 18, with­out parental su­per­vi­sion and cell­phone, and it was re­mark­ably safe and jovial. The 2020s have ar­rived with fe­ro­cious fires in Aus­tralia, po­ten­tial war be­tween the US and its al­lies and Iran, and the strange case of the Bri­tish be­ing fed up enough to leave the ben­e­fits of the EU be­hind. There is no way in which one can look at all this and feel at ease. This will be a decade of un­ease.’ I don t say this be­cause I want to be the bearer of bad news but be­cause it seems we need to Ara­bia, gird our loins which and get view ready Iran for’a s dif­fi­cult ride. In the case of the war with Iran, it seems to be part of a large chess game be­ing played by the Is­raeli state and Saudi strength as a threat in the Mid­dle East. US pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been a use­ful idiot for the ag­gres­sive re­gional war­mon­ger­ing of Is­rael’s Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and Saudi’s Mo­ham­mad Bin Sal­man. For the US, this is a bad longterm move. It means more mil­i­tary en­tan­gle­ments far away from home, more body bags of dead Amer­i­can sol­diers re­turn­ing home, an in­crease in mil­i­tary spend­ing and new in­spi­ra­tion for ji­hadists. All of this will weaken the US for years be­yond Trump, es­pe­cially with the ris­ing poverty and in­equal­ity of its own pop­u­la­tion. What we are wit­ness­ing is the con­tin­ued de­cline of US as a su­per­power – and China is watch­ing keenly. China has out­paced the US in terms of key tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion, es­pe­cially in the form of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and sur­veil­lance. More fun­da­men­tally, the US re­mains de­pen­dent on China as its in­dus­trial man­u­fac­tur­ing base. Amer­ica will never re­build the in­dus­tries it sent to China. The 2020s will be the decade for China to qui­etly be­gin pass­ing the US in the race for world lead­er­ship. There is also a bad omen in US pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has been a use­ful idiot for the ag­gres­sive re­gional war­mon­ger­ing of Is­rael’s Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu and Saudi’s Mo­ham­mad Bin Sal­man the fires rav­aging drought­stricken Aus­tralia, whose gov­ern­ment un­der Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son seems en­gulfed in cli­mate change de­nial­ism. Mor­ri­son’s coun­try has been burn­ing for months. Half a bil­lion an­i­mals are dead and the cloud of smoke is af­fect­ing air qual­ity as far away as New Zealand. Images of thou­sands of an­i­mals lit­ter­ing the road­sides, dead from smoke in­hala­tion, have re­vealed just how grim the sit­u­a­tion is. Aus­tralians are stunned and dev­as­tated by the un­re­lent­ing na­ture of this fire, whose trail of dev­as­ta­tion is big­ger than many coun­tries. The only re­al­ity here is, we will not out­run the cli­mate. Well, all this seems gloomy. There was one glim­mer of hope. It was the Year of Re­turn in Ghana, cel­e­brated by black African peo­ple from across the di­as­pora. Ghana is­sued one mil­lion visas for de­scen­dants of Africans across the world to come and pay homage to their an­ces­tral con­ti­nent. Be­lieve it or not, Ghana’s in­de­pen­dence from colo­nial­ism was 64 years ago! One hopes that the Year of Re­turn will give Africans some­thing to build hope on in what prom­ises to be a dif­fi­cult decade. Stay strong MaAfrika.

Bil­lions of dol­lars have been in­vested by ma­jor oil com­pa­nies Chevron and Exxon Mo­bil in re­cent years to in­crease pro­duc­tion in An­gola – both firms pump over half of the coun­try’s daily oil pro­duc­tion.

za,The Star Late Edition,20150420,China goes into stim­u­lus mode,"CHINA’S lead­ers swung into stim­u­lus mode, cut­ting the amount of cash lenders must set aside as re­serves by the most since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis just days af­ter a re­port showed the slow­est eco­nomic growth in six years. The re­serve-re­quire­ment ra­tio will be low­ered 1 per­cent­age point ef­fec­tive to­day, the Peo­ple’s Bank of China said yes­ter­day, the sec­ond re­duc­tion this year and the largest since Novem­ber 2008. The level will decline to 18.5 per­cent, still high by global stan­dards, based on pre­vi­ous state­ments. The move puts China more firmly in the eas­ing camp with the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank and the Bank of Ja­pan and fol­lows a vow by Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang last month to step in if the econ­omy’s slow­down hurts jobs as well as Peo­ple’s Bank of China (PBOC) Gover­nor Zhou Xiaochuan’s week­end com­ment that China has room to act. The cut will al­low banks to boost lend­ing, un­leash­ing about 1.2 tril­lion yuan (R2.36 tril­lion), and may spur an­other leg higher in the na­tion’s boom­ing stock mar­ket. “This RRR cut is much big­ger than the mar­ket an­tic­i­pated and banks will be flooded with liq­uid­ity,” said Liu Li­Gang, chief China econ­o­mist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Bank­ing Group in Hong Kong. “It will also add fuel to the al­ready red hot stock mar­ket.” The re­duc­tion adds to the PBOC’s own mon­e­tary eas­ing and that of about 30 coun­ter­parts around the world this year as pol­icy mak­ers con­front the risk of ex­ces­sively low in­fla­tion. The world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy also is con­tend­ing with an out­flow of cap­i­tal and slow­ing do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion that threat­ens the job cre­ation needed to keep ur­ban­i­sa­tion go­ing. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct ex­panded 7 per­cent in the three months to March from a year ear­lier, the least since 2009, while industrial pro­duc­tion in March rose at the slow­est rate since Novem­ber 2008. An econ­omy-wide in­fla­tion in­di­ca­tor turned neg­a­tive last quar­ter for the first time since 2009, sug­gest­ing room for eas­ing. “The move is pos­i­tive, show­ing pol­icy mak­ers are try­ing to off­set the im­pact of po­ten­tial cap­i­tal out­flow and sta­bilise the macro en­vi­ron­ment,” said He­len Qiao, Hong Kong-based chief greater China econ­o­mist at Mor­gan Stan­ley. “The 100 ba­sis point cut shows the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of pol­icy eas­ing, which is war­ranted given the sharp slow­down.” Banks in­clud­ing Mac­quarie, HSBC and No­mura had flagged the need for fur­ther stim­u­lus af­ter the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct re­port and March in­di­ca­tors, which also showed an un­ex­pected slump in ex­ports. ‘Dark­est pe­riod’ “Pol­icy mak­ers are quite con­cerned,” said Larry Hu, TJE head of China eco­nomics at Mac­quarie in Hong Kong.

za,Daily News,20190205,Does SA’s po­si­tion on Venezuela mat­ter?,"SOUTH Africa can be pi­geon-holed as an ex-Bri­tish colony and a for­mer apartheid state. Its pol­i­tics is ide­o­log­i­cally in­con­sis­tent. The fact that South Africa was once colonised by the Bri­tish had an im­pact on the man­ner in which the apartheid govern­ment or­gan­ised it­self. They used the fact that Bri­tain and the US were against com­mu­nism to mo­bilise sup­port from the two coun­tries. In ad­di­tion, the ANC was as­so­ci­ated with Rus­sia and com­mu­nism. This also meant the ANC was the en­emy of democ­racy and cap­i­tal­ism. More so, the apartheid govern­ment em­pha­sised this, know­ing the West would per­ceive the ANC as their ad­ver­sary. In 1994, com­mu­nism was never in­tro­duced, at least for­mally. The ANC chose to use some of the prin­ci­ples of com­mu­nism or so­cial­ism per se, such as pro­vid­ing free houses, ed­u­ca­tion and so­cial grants. It is worth high­light­ing that while pro-cap­i­tal­ists say the ANC-led govern­ment is noth­ing but a sub­tle form of com­mu­nism, those at the bottom of the food chain be­lieve its emer­gence to power brought noth­ing but cap­i­tal­ism. South Africa is now a two-in-one coun­try pulling in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions. Those who ben­e­fited (white South Africans) are mostly in sup­port of cap­i­tal­ism, since their lives flour­ished un­der cap­i­tal­ism and con­tinue to do so. In con­trast, those who con­tinue to linger in poverty (mostly black South Africans) be­lieve the ANC has sold out to the cap­i­tal­ists. The line be­tween sup­port­ing com­mu­nism for the pur­pose of el­e­vat­ing the poor and sup­port­ing corruption has proven to be thin in the case of the ANC. Thus, their sup­port for Venezuela’s Ni­co­las Maduro is quite con­cern­ing in as much as the pro­posed coup (or regime change) by the US is. Venezuela un­der Maduro has im­ple­mented some ap­peal­ing eco­nomic poli­cies, such as the tak­ing of the land and giv­ing it to the poor. Such a move has led to crit­i­cism by the pro­po­nents of pri­vate prop­erty rights. Venezuela is now in tat­ters due to heavy sanc­tions by the US and EU. These sanc­tions are based on the un­der­stand­ing that Maduro’s govern­ment has in­fringed upon hu­man rights, si­lenced the me­dia and there have been re­ports of po­lit­i­cal in­tol­er­ance. The con­se­quences of Maduro’s so­cial­ist regime has some­how led to the preva­lence of ex­ces­sive poverty. The US (sup­ported by Bri­tain) has a bad record of top­pling gov­ern­ments and leav­ing the coun­tries in ru­ins while ex­tract­ing their nat­u­ral re­sources. Thus, it is not clear as to whether the US and its al­lies are con­cerned with the state of democ­racy in Venezuela or the aim is to get to the oil re­serves. Rus­sia is against the pro­posed regime change. South Africa is not the only coun­try in sup­port of Maduro. How­ever, Rus­sia is eco­nom­i­cally stronger than South Africa, which re­lies on in­vest­ment from the West. Hence, South Africa can be eas­ily swayed into agree­ing or vot­ing with the US in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. South Africa’s po­si­tion is un­for­tu­nately in the hands of the West, since the coun­try is eco­nom­i­cally de­pen­dent on their trade. This is not to un­der­mine the fact that South Africa does trade with China and Rus­sia. None­the­less, the West still plays a sig­nif­i­cant role in shap­ing the economy.

The pledges were made at a high-level donor round ta­ble con­vened by the United Na­tions Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion (FAO) and Equa­to­rial Guinea Pres­i­dent Obiang Nguema Mba­sogo, on the side­lines of the African De­vel­op­ment Bank’s 2019 an­nual meet­ings in Mal­abo, Equa­to­rial Guinea. The donor con­fer­ence was at­tended by the pres­i­dents of Mau­ri­ta­nia, Guinea Bis­sau, the prime min­is­ter of Eswa­tini and sev­eral high-rank­ing di­plo­mats, min­is­ters and de­vel­op­ment and bank­ing in­sti­tu­tions. Turn­ing point Open­ing the con­fer­ence at the Sipopo con­fer­ence cen­tre, Mba­sogo said the fund il­lus­trated “a turn­ing point in the fight against food in­se­cu­rity” and said his tiny oil-rich na­tion had do­nated gen­er­ously out of its oil rev­enues to show sol­i­dar­ity to African coun­tries. The fund re­ceived its start-up con­tri­bu­tion of $30 mil­lion from Equa­to­rial Guinea, the host na­tion of this year’s meet­ings, and An­gola, which gave $10 mil­lion. Its projects have been lauded for pro­vid­ing in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions for African agri­cul­ture and food sys­tems. Speak­ing on be­half of African De­vel­op­ment Bank pres­i­dent Ak­in­wumi Adesina, bank vice-pres­i­dent Jen­nifer Blanke said Africa faced chal­lenges in the area of agri­cul­ture and food pro­duc­tion, re­ly­ing heav­ily on food im­ports. “It’s so im­por­tant that ASTF is show­ing that African coun­tries are con­tribut­ing to Africa. “That phi­los­o­phy links very closely to what we are do­ing at Africa De­vel­op­ment Bank,” Blanke said, adding the bank’s com­mit­ment to pro­vid­ing farm­ers with tech­nolo­gies to help im­prove their yields. Theme The theme of the bank’s meet­ings this year is “Re­gional In­te­gra­tion for Africa’s Eco­nomic Pros­per­ity”. The push for re­gional in­te­gra­tion has gained mo­men­tum with the rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the agree­ment on the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in March 2018, which is now at the thresh­old of its launch in July. “You can count on us that we will be very in­volved,” said Blanke. Maria He­lena Semedo, deputy di­rec­tor-gen­eral of FAO, com­mended the fund for its ex­cel­lent re­sults. The fund has led to the suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of 18 projects that have ben­e­fit­ted 41 coun­tries and hun­dreds and thou­sands of ben­e­fi­cia­ries on the con­ti­nent. The ben­e­fi­cia­ries in­clude 160 vul­ner­a­ble house­holds in Niger, who saw trans­for­ma­tion and grants which en­abled a rapid re­sponse to pop­u­la­tions af­fected in the ebola out­break in west Africa in 2014. “We cel­e­brate the suc­cess of the ASTF … the ex­cel­lent re­sults of the fund over the last five years is liv­ing tes­ti­mony,” Semedo said, de­scrib­ing it as a flag­ship ini­tia­tive and one of the most suc­cess­ful fund­ing ini­tia­tives in FAO.

za,The Sunday Independent,20180422,Ad­dress­ing gross in­equal­ity is key to progress,"LETTA Mbulu’s fa­mous song, was a warn­ing that we have yet to achieve our eco­nomic free­dom in this coun­try. Al­though its eight years since we be­gan to sing her lyrics, the World Bank still iden­ti­fies us as one of the most un­equal so­ci­eties in the world. It is true that in­come in­equal­ity has in­creased in al­most all re­gions of the world in re­cent decades, but South Africa stands out for its stark dis­par­i­ties – a re­al­ity we should have more ef­fec­tively tack­led over the past 24 years of our lib­er­a­tion. How is it pos­si­ble that 29% of our pop­u­la­tion are still trapped in poverty, un­able to buy enough food or ac­cess ba­sic health care? When you con­sider that four-fifths of the ru­ral pop­u­la­tion lives be­low the poverty line, while the av­er­age busi­ness ex­ec­u­tive earns R18 mil­lion a year, we are in a cri­sis. We may have at­tained all the rel­e­vant po­lit­i­cal free­doms, but are we re­ally free when the top 10% of South African earn­ers cap­ture 66% of the na­tional in­come? That same 10% also own 90% of our as­sets, whereas that same per­cent­age of the pop­u­la­tion in ad­vanced coun­tries would gen­er­ally own 75%. Just as Joshua Nkomo said in the early years of Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion, it is pos­si­ble for a coun­try to gain free­dom but for the peo­ple not to be free. While we are busy squab­bling over whether R20 an hour is an ac­cept­able min­i­mum wage to be adopted in the com­ing months for the work­ing class, we live with the re­al­ity that, ac­cord­ing to Ox­fam, it takes 4.5 days for the best­paid ex­ec­u­tive at Sho­prite to earn what a tem­po­rary farm worker earns in their life­time. It is in­struc­tive to com­pare our pro­posed min­i­mum wage with that of other coun­tries: in Canada it is R105 an hour, in Aus­tralia R169 and in a de­vel­op­ing coun­try like In­dia, R31. There is no ques­tion that we are not do­ing enough to close the em­bar­rass­ing wealth gap in this coun­try. What we need is de­lib­er­ate and pro­gres­sive state in­ter­ven­tion to achieve the nec­es­sary changes for fun­da­men­tal eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. China has recorded much higher growth rates with sig­nif­i­cantly lower in­equal­ity lev­els than In­dia, which in­di­cates that govern­ment pol­icy mat­ters a lot. We need poli­cies to democra­tise ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion and well-pay­ing jobs, em­bark on am­bi­tious land re­form, in­vest in a sig­nif­i­cant way in health care and make transportation in this coun­try sig­nif­i­cantly more af­ford­able. Work­ers spend a dis­pro­por­tion­ate amount of their monthly in­come on trans­port. To ac­com­plish this we will need to in­tro­duce greater tax­a­tion on the wealthy and en­sure that for­tunes are not moved be­yond the reach of the na­tional tax au­thor­i­ties, as ev­i­denced in the Panama pa­pers. Un­for­tu­nately our for­mer pres­i­dents have presided over large-scale rev­enue out­flows in the post-demo­cratic pe­riod, with man­sions and yachts be­ing bought by the su­per-elite in the South of France. Busi­ness will also need to em­brace a trans­for­ma­tive agenda and en­sure worker par­tic­i­pa­tion on their boards. At the core of the mat­ter is the fact that un­em­ploy­ment is a huge driver of in­equal­ity. Most of us are aware that the role of skills and labour mar­ket fac­tors has grown in im­por­tance in ex­plain­ing poverty and in­equal­ity, and we ur­gently need skilled job cre­ation. Ac­cord­ing to last month’s World Bank re­port on poverty in South Africa, the role of gen­der and race – while still im­por­tant – has de­clined. One of the great­est ob­sta­cles to South Africa’s real eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion is that macro-eco­nomic think­ing is still mired in neo-lib­eral ortho­doxy. Sadly, the tra­jec­tory of poverty re­duc­tion was re­versed in the years 2011-2015. That was largely ow­ing to the fact that cor­rup­tion and state cap­ture plagued our demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions and state-owned enterprises, di­vert­ing sig­nif­i­cant resources away from es­sen­tial projects sup­posed to de­liver much-needed ser­vices to the peo­ple. The fact that our sov­er­eign rat­ings are on the brink of junk sta­tus is a na­tional shame. Junk sta­tus is not sim­ply a deroga­tory term, but part of an in­dex which de­ter­mines whether a na­tion can ac­cess funds from in­sti­tu­tions. Junk sta­tus will peg us at non­in­vest­ment grade, which would se­verely im­pact on our abil­ity to woo in­vestors and sub­se­quently cre­ate new jobs. It is high time for us to right the ship and put all our col­lec­tive resources into en­sur­ing that we govern for the ben­e­fit of the masses and not the elite. In the im­me­di­ate post-1994 pe­riod, we were the dar­ling of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity – the world loved and re­spected us and we were per­ceived to have done all the right things. There is no rea­son why we can’t re­claim the moral high ground and pre­serve the in­tegrity of our tran­si­tion.",南非

China, which has dou­bled meat con­sump­tion in the past two decades, may boost in­ter­na­tional soya bean pur­chases by 33 per­cent to 66.9 mil­lion tons by 2014, a 16.6 mil­lion-ton in­crease that is more than Iowa, the largest US grower, pro­duced last year, gov­ern­ment data show. US farm­ers are cut­ting back on plant­ing, mean­ing prices will rise 21 per­cent to $16.80 a bushel (R4 066 a ton) by De­cem­ber 31, an an­a­lyst sur­vey shows. Al­most half the world’s pork comes from China, which has 689 mil­lion pigs and will be re­spon­si­ble for all of this year’s in­crease in global sup­ply, the US Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture (USDA) es­ti­mates. That is adding to China’s de­pen­dence on raw ma­te­rial im­ports from Brazil to Aus­tralia to the US, mak­ing it vul­ner­a­ble to in­fla­tion that Premier Wen Ji­abao has pledged to com­bat with­out de­rail­ing eco­nomic growth. “China is build­ing a live­stock and meat in­dus­try in five years that took the US 50 years,” said Michael Swan­son, the se­nior agri­cul­tural econ­o­mist in Min­neapo­lis for San Fran­cisco-based Wells Fargo. “US farm trade with China may dou­ble in the next five years.” The 13-fold ex­pan­sion in China’s econ­omy in the past two decades has meant an al­most dou­bling in meat con­sump­tion by the coun­try’s 1.34 bil­lion peo­ple, World Bank and gov­ern­ment data show. While the US trade deficit with China widened by about 13 per­cent to $23.3 bil­lion in Jan­uary, ex­ports of US farm goods are the high­est ever and the Asian nation is the top cus­tomer. China may in­crease soya bean im­ports to 68 mil­lion tons by 2014, a 17.7 mil­lion ton in­crease from last year that would ex­ceed the pur­chases fore­cast by the USDA, ac­cord­ing to Grant Kim­ber­ley, the di­rec­tor of mar­ket pro­mo­tion for the Iowa Soy­bean As­so­ci­a­tion. Farm­ers in the state reaped 13.5 mil­lion tons in 2010. China con­sumes one in ev­ery four tons pro­duced glob­ally. It takes about 2.8 kilo­grams of feed to pro­duce one kilo­gram of pork, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Soy­bean As­so­ci­a­tion. In­creased meat pro­duc­tion and de­mand for feed is com­ing at a time of near­record global food prices that con­trib­uted to protests across north­ern Africa and the Mid­dle East, top­pling lead­ers in Egypt and Tu­nisia. Ris­ing prices had pushed about 44 mil­lion peo­ple into poverty since June last year, the World Bank said in Fe­bru­ary. Soya beans are lit­tle changed on the Chicago Board of Trade this year and were at $14.08 a bushel at 1.30pm in Sin­ga­pore, com­pared with a 25 per­cent surge in maize and a 43 per­cent ad­vance in cot­ton. That is spurring US farm­ers, the world’s largest grow­ers and ex­porters, to sow the fewest acres with soya beans in three years, the USDA es­ti­mates. When the har­vest be­gins in Septem­ber, US stock­piles will be enough to cover 15 days of de­mand, the fewest since 1965. China will im­port a record 57 mil­lion tons in the 12 months to Oc­to­ber, more than twice the amount five years ago and 60 per­cent of the global to­tal, the USDA es­ti­mates. As do­mes­tic agri­cul­tural out­put failed to keep pace with de­mand last year, China’s im­ports jumped 34 per­cent to $17.52bn. Pork ac­counts for about three-quar­ters of Chinese meat de­mand, the USDA es­ti­mates. “China will be a grow­ing mar­ket for the next decade,” said Kim­ber­ley, who farms 1 619ha with his fa­ther in Maxwell, Iowa, and spent 10 days in China last month with pro­ces­sors, im­porters and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials. “Chinese peo­ple are be­com­ing more af­flu­ent and want to eat more meat.” Ef­forts to curb in­fla­tion may slow growth. The Peo­ple’s Bank of China raised in­ter­est rates for a fourth time in six months on April 5, be­fore a re­port that is fore­cast to show con­sumer prices climbed 5.2 per­cent last month from a year ear­lier, the fastest pace since 2008. Food in­fla­tion reached 11 per­cent in Fe­bru­ary, gov­ern­ment data show. Wen’s goal is a 4 per­cent rate. The gov­ern­ment has been sell­ing soya beans from state stock­piles af­ter spot prices climbed 19 per­cent in the past year in the city of Dalian. Whole­sale pork prices in China have surged 40 per­cent since May last year and the av­er­age per­son in China will con­sume a record 39.3kg of pork this year, com­pared with 19.7kg in 1990, based on USDA es­ti­mates. – Bloomberg",南非
za,Weekend Argus (Saturday Edition),20130406,Brics: SA’S role a poser,"YES, in­deed, South Africa can­not com­pare its econ­omy with that of fel­low Brics mem­ber China and, in­deed, we may won­der what is in South Africa’s in­ter­est in be­ing a mem­ber of this sup­pos­edly au­gust and pow­er­ful group of five coun­tries. As Roy Robins (“South Africa more than an­other Bric in the wall”, Week­end Ar­gus, March 30) pointed out, South Korea, Turkey or Mex­ico would have been a bet­ter choice for the Brics clan, if for no other rea­son than that they have a far more ex­u­ber­ant econ­omy than ours. But, of course, as has al­ways been the case when the ques­tion of trade arises, South Africa is strate­gi­cally placed as the gate­way to Africa for stronger na­tions to ex­ploit its re­sources and its largely un­so­phis­ti­cated peo­ple for their own eco­nomic ben­e­fits. Trade as we know it should be a two-way process, ben­e­fit­ing both par­ties, but it has be­come abun­dantly clear that South Africa has be­come a dump­ing ground for much wealth­ier and more devel­oped coun­tries to fob off very in­fe­rior cloth­ing (es­pe­cially) and ev­ery­thing from a nee­dle to an an­chor, and per­haps even the ships or boats to go with it. One can scarcely pick up any­thing off the shelf in a store or su­per­mar­ket with­out read­ing “Made in China” on a la­bel, thus sup­port­ing Robins’s quote from Nige­rian Cen­tral Bank gov­er­nor Lamido Sanusi that “Africans re­alise that their ro­mance with China has en­cour­aged a new form of im­pe­ri­al­ism”. He said China was no longer a “fel­low un­der­de­vel­op­ment coun­try”, but a “sig­nif­i­cant con­trib­u­tor to Africa’s dein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and un­der­de­vel­op­ment”. The ques­tion is how are we ben­e­fit­ing from trade with China? Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma’s deal­ings with China par­tic­u­larly – that coun­try be­ing wealth­i­est and most pow­er­ful – gives cause for great con­cern when he speaks of the “in­equal­ity and un­sus­tain­abil­ity” of Sino- South Africa trade and urg­ing cau­tion when en­ter­ing into part­ner­ships with other coun- tries, hav­ing been pledged a $20 bil­lion loan to Africa by China’s then pres­i­dent, Hu Jin­tao, the pre­vi­ous day Do we have faith in our head of state when he speaks with such a forked tongue? I think not. Two very in­ter­est­ing doc­u­men­taries on tele­vi­sion re­cently re­vealed the ex­tent to which China is sidelin­ing, with stealth and ag­gres­sive Chi­nese com­merce, South African small busi­ness own­ers and African work­ers, “ex­port­ing un­em­ploy­ment to Africa”, as PG Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Ste­wart Jen­nings said. In the doc­u­men­tary on the Chi­nese in Tan­za­nia the young son of the former founder of the large hospi­tal who went back to China talks of his life and of run­ning the hospi­tal with mainly Chi­nese doc­tors. It has be­come clear that the Chi­nese are here to ex­ploit ev­ery­thing we have to of­fer, in­clud­ing our peo­ple, as I saw for my­self when a group of Tan­za­ni­ans pro­duced the most beau­ti­ful carved wood stat­ues and or­na­ments, more than a thou­sand of which were sent to China for their mu­se­ums and pri­vate pur­chasers and for which the sculp­tors were paid a mere pit­tance. One of the Chi­nese in the pro­gramme was a wealthy man with an en­gi­neer­ing and con­struc­tion busi­ness in Tan­za­nia. He would re­turn to China when he grew old, he told view­ers with­out a blink of an eye, for Tan­za­nia was just his sec­ond home. This man was only one of sev­eral peo­ple from China who re­gard South Africa, Tan­za­nia and other African coun­tries as their sec­ond home, to which they bring in their (mostly) in­fe­rior goods, de­priv­ing our peo­ple of em­ploy­ment. Our fac­to­ries (es­pe­cially cloth­ing ) have al­most all gone. The Chi­nese are build­ing hos­pi­tals and who knows what else – with stealth and quiet ag­gres­sion un­til we will be over­whelmed with in­debt­ed­ness to China, and an in­creas­ing in­flux of Chi­nese colo­nial­ists. The fact that China in­vited South Africa to join the Brics or­gan­i­sa­tion is, of course, sus­pect, as we do not need their goods, but they need ours. All our valu­able re­sources are now right at their fin­ger­tips, while our own peo­ple suf­fer loss through in­creas­ing un­em­ploy­ment and the re­sult­ing poverty and depre­da­tion. When peo­ple lose hope they be­come des­per­ate and vi­o­lence and anar­chy pre­vail. Is this what Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma has in­vited into our coun­try by sign­ing up to be­come a mem­ber of Brics and con­tribut­ing only a mud Bric to that Great Wall of China?",南非
za,Pretoria News,20160916,‘Cri­sis’ means change is needed…,"BUSI­NESS de­ci­sion-mak­ers in South Africa may be sur­prised to learn that the econ­omy will con­tinue to ex­clude mil­lions of peo­ple un­til they have a greater sense of cri­sis. Since news re­ports and so­cial me­dia are filled with sto­ries of im­pend­ing doom, it might seem that busi­nesses are deal­ing with more crises than they can man­age. But a cri­sis is not a panic – it does not mean sim­ply that peo­ple feel that things are go­ing badly wrong. The Greek word “cri­sis” means “turn­ing point” and so a sense of cri­sis means not only a re­al­i­sa­tion that the coun­try has a prob­lem, but an ac­knowl­edge­ment that solv­ing it re­quires change. It is this which is lack­ing among most South African busi­ness lead­ers to­day. Be­cause there is lit­tle recog­ni­tion of a need to change, there is lit­tle en­thu­si­asm for mea­sures which would open up the econ­omy’s ben­e­fits to more peo­ple by giv­ing the gov­ern­ment a greater role. Most busi­ness lead­ers are aware that the econ­omy is not meet­ing the needs of most South Africans. The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund’s (IMF) David Lip­ton has warned that many South Africans were ex­cluded from the for­mal econ­omy. But most lack a sense of cri­sis. They’re un­will­ing to ac­cept that the way the mar­ket econ­omy op­er­ates is part of the prob­lem. While some busi­ness lead­er­ship does see the need for the gov­ern­ment to fight poverty, the dom­i­nant view sees the gov­ern­ment and labour as the prob­lem. This view sees the mar­ket as the only so­lu­tion. In their eyes eco­nomic ex­clu­sion is the fault of a gov­ern­ment and union­ists who are ide­o­log­i­cally blind, greedy and in­com­pe­tent. One con­se­quence is to de­cry all gov­ern­ment at­tempts to play a role in the econ­omy. Mea­sures that seek to ad­dress poverty and ex­clu­sion are treated no dif­fer­ently from those that al­low politi­cians to get their hands on pub­lic re­sources at the ex­pense of ev­ery­one else. As long as this view pre­vails, busi­ness lead­ers are un­likely to sup­port the changes which will widen the ben­e­fits of the for­mal econ­omy or pub­lic poli­cies which would have the same ef­fect. The re­sis­tance of many busi­ness lead­ers to change is not sim­ply an ex­pres­sion of self-in­ter­est. Some changes might force busi­nesses to pay a price they’d pre­fer to avoid. But many would re­quire only small ad­just­ments and pro­duce great ben­e­fits. The fre­quent claim that pro­tec­tions for work­ers in labour law are ob­sta­cles to growth has been con­tra­dicted by IMF re­search. This has not stopped busi­ness from con­tin­u­ing to blame them. When main­stream eco­nomic opin­ion blames busi­ness at­ti­tudes and prac­tices, it is ig­nored. Lip­ton’s view that the pri­vate sec­tor has been sup­ported in ways that cre­ate priv­i­leged mar­kets work­ing against the in­ter­ests of con­sumers was brushed aside while his crit­i­cism of the gov­ern­ment was high­lighted. This cli­mate may help ex­plain why many busi­ness lead­ers deny the need to change and the lack of sup­port for mea­sures which would cause busi­nesses min­i­mum pain but would make a huge dif­fer­ence. The gov­ern­ment, of course, does need to change. The lo­cal elec­tions may have given it some of the sense of cri­sis which it needs. It could be ar­gued that gov­ern­ment waste is one rea­son busi­ness lead­er­ship is reluc­tant to sup­port a greater pub­lic sec­tor role in fight­ing poverty. But it is equally true that poverty, in­equal­ity and ex­clu­sion are re­spon­si­ble for most of our eco­nomic ills and so­lu­tions do not lie in sim­ply al­low­ing mar­kets to do their job. The story of the past decade is not one in which the mar­ket has in­cluded while gov­ern­ment pol­icy has ex­cluded. The last cen­sus showed that gov­ern­ment pro­vi­sion of ser­vices had in­creased and re­search shows this has re­duced poverty. But in­come in­equal­ity in the mar­ket­place re­mained largely un­changed and for this busi­ness must share re­spon­si­bil­ity with gov­ern­ment and labour. If busi­ness lead­ers did have a sense of cri­sis, they might con­sider ask­ing what can be done to lower the bar­ri­ers to en­try which keep so many at the edges of the for­mal econ­omy. But, be­fore then, they would sup­port gov­ern­ment mea­sures which would cost lit­tle and make a huge dif­fer­ence. They would re­ject the mar­ket fun­da­men­tal­ism of those who de­cry any gov­ern­ment role and would sup­port prag­matic mea­sures to re­duce poverty and in­equal­ity. De­spite the blare of mar­ket fun­da­men­tal­ism, the ev­i­dence sug­gests South Africa’s al­ready high lev­els of poverty would be much higher with­out two life­lines which save many from des­ti­tu­tion. These are wage bar­gain­ing, which en­ables work­ers to share re­sources with un­em­ployed de­pen­dants, and so­cial grants. Yet both are blamed for caus­ing the prob­lems they are help­ing to solve be­cause they limit the power of the mar­ket. These are by no means the only ex­am­ples of ways in which leav­en­ing the mar­ket with a gov­ern­ment role can ex­tend eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties to many more peo­ple. Recog­nis­ing their im­por­tance may be a first sig­nal that more busi­ness lead­ers are see­ing the need to change cur­rent pat­terns rather than blam­ing them on oth­ers. – www.the­con­ver­sa­tion.com Fried­man is a pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal stud­ies at Wits Univer­sity. of US sol­diers based in South Korea could po­ten­tially be march­ing up to the Chi­nese bor­der. China is also con­cerned about the wider geo-po­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of the US and South Korea in­stalling an anti-mis­sile de­fence sys­tem, which South Korea in­sists is im­per­a­tive for its pro­tec­tion from its north­ern neigh­bour. China is staunchly op­posed to the in­stal­la­tion of the Ter­mi­nal High Alti­tude Area De­fence (THAAD), as it could po­ten­tially be used to launch of­fen­sive weapons within the re­gion, not merely de­fen­sively against North Korea. This is not the type of weapons sys­tem that China would rel­ish hav­ing on its doorstep. So the pun­ish­ment of North Korea’s lead­er­ship is des­tined to be harsh, but not harsh enough to bring down the regime. With the prospect of an even greater eco­nomic squeeze on the North Korean regime, its lead­er­ship will be des­per­ate to raise for­eign cur­rency abroad, us­ing its diplo­matic prox­ies as in­come gen­er­a­tors. If North Korean diplo­mats were al­ready ac­tive in il­licit smug­gling in south­ern Africa over the past decade to raise for­eign cur­rency for the regime, this poses an even more se­ri­ous threat in the years to come. The prod­uct most fre­quently sought af­ter has been rhino horn, and cir­cum­stances would sug­gest that this will in­creas­ingly be­come the pri­mary tar­get for in­come gen­er­a­tion. South Africa’s na­tional in­ter­ests are at stake, as our fast dis­ap­pear­ing rhi­nos are likely to face an on­slaught, par­tic­u­larly those in the Kruger Na­tional Park as North Korean smug­gling rings op­er­ate pri­mar­ily out of Mozam­bique. Last May a North Korean diplo­mat based at the em­bassy in Pre­to­ria was caught with 4.5kg of rhino horn and $100 000 in Ma­puto. The North Korean am­bas­sador to South Africa paid $30 000 for his re­lease and the of­fi­cial was asked to leave South Africa or be­come per­sona non grata. Ac­cord­ing to a re­port by The Global Ini­tia­tive, the North Korean em­bassy in Ethiopia is also be­ing used as a tran­sit point for the smug­gling of il­licit wildlife prod­ucts to Asia, with em­bassy of­fi­cials abus­ing their diplo­matic sta­tus to act as couri­ers. With diplo­mats be­ing able to hide il­licit goods in the “diplo­matic bag” and with im­mu­nity from search in terms of their per­sonal lug­gage, it has made it easy for North Korean of­fi­cials to smug­gle il­licit goods. How­ever, in­creas­ingly cus­toms of­fi­cials are be­ing en­cour­aged to search diplo­matic lug­gage they sus­pect of con­tain­ing il­licit goods. Zim­babwe and Zam­bia bat­tled to cur­tail the il­licit smug­gling ac­tiv­i­ties of North Korean em­bassy of­fi­cials, and ul­ti­mately the em­bassies were closed 18 years ago. In 1989, the En­vi­ron­men­tal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Agency ac­cused vir­tu­ally the en­tire staff of the diplo­matic mis­sions of North Korea in Zim­babwe and Zam­bia of be­ing in­volved in the il­le­gal rhino horn trade. With­out em­bassies in Zim­babwe and Zam­bia, North Korea has been re­ly­ing on its pres­ence in South Africa as a way to gen­er­ate in­come through il­licit smug­gling. Know­ing this, it is in­cum­bent on us to en­sure that the North Korean pres­ence does not equate with more rhino horn leav­ing the coun­try. US ma­gi­cian, 60.

za,The Citizen (KZN),20110208,‘No limit to eco­nomic growth’,"SUS­TAIN­ABIL­ITY is an im­per­a­tive in South Africa and does not have to come at the ex­pense of eco­nomic growth – but busi­ness may be un­wise to wait for demo­cratic pro­cesses to de­liver the pace and scale of change needed. So says Jør­gen Ran­ders, Pro­fes­sor of cli­mate strat­egy at the Nor­we­gian School of Man­age­ment and fac­ulty mem­ber of the Uni­ver­sity of Cam­bridge Pro­gramme for Sus­tain­abil­ity Lead­er­ship (CPSL). Speak­ing at a spe­cial fo­rum or­gan­ised by the South African of­fice of CPSL in Cape Town re­cently, Ran­ders said that eco­nomic growth is, with­out doubt, the most ef­fec­tive way to ad­dress so­cial is­sues such as job cre­ation, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and se­cu­rity in old age. For this rea­son, growth is vi­tal in an econ­omy such as South Africa’s, which has high lev­els of poverty and un­em­ploy­ment. And de­ci­sions around cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion and sus­tain­able busi­ness – while crit­i­cal – can­not come at the ex­pense of such growth. Rather, the coun­try has to find a way to grow the econ­omy while ad­dress­ing very real cli­mate change threats. The good news is that, in Ran­ders’s view, this is Eco­nomic growth with job cre­ation should be this coun­try’s first pri­or­ity, says cli­mate Pro­fes­sor Jør­gen Ran­ders. It is said to be pos­si­ble to deal with cli­mate con­sid­er­a­tions too, as China is said to do. en­tirely pos­si­ble. “Eco­nomic growth with a re­duc­tion in car­bon emis­sions is fully doable us­ing ex­ist­ing tech­nolo­gies – and it is not even very ex­pen­sive – per­haps in the or­der of 1% of GDP,” says Ran­ders. Co-author of the provoca­tive and highly in­flu­en­tial Lim­its to Growth which first ap­peared in 1972, Ran­ders is of­ten crit­i­cised for be­ing anti eco­nomic growth in favour of sus­tain­abil­ity but says noth­ing is fur­ther from the truth. “I be­lieve that there are no lim­its to eco­nomic growth and that growth need not be a threat to sus­tain­abil­ity. The real prob­lem is with de­ci­sion de­lays. That is what is dan­ger­ous. Not that the world has limited ca­pac­ity, not that we are grow­ing too fast, but that the hard de­ci­sions that need to be taken to en­sure we can sur­vive this growth, are not be­ing taken fast enough as politi­cians do not have a man­date to sac­ri­fice short-term gains for long-term se­cu­rity. “It is a ques­tion of po­lit­i­cal will. And the demo­cratic process is the biggest ob­sta­cle.” Ran­ders, who has spent the past 40 years as a pi­o­neer­ing voice in the de­bate around sus­tain­abil­ity ver­sus growth, cites China as an ex­am­ple of a govern­ment that is get­ting it right. The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is suc­cess­fully grow­ing the econ­omy and rais­ing the stan­dards of liv­ing of its pop­u­la­tion while re­duc­ing emis­sions rel­a­tive to GDP – which should be the goal of gov­ern­ments ev­ery­where. “China is very aware of the dangers of cli­mate change,” says Ran­ders. “As a land­locked coun­try, tem­per­a­tures are al­ready up by 2% and rain­fall pat­terns have shifted rad­i­cally.” He says the Chi­nese are re­spond­ing by, among other things, in­vest­ing in green tech­nolo­gies such as elec­tric cars, al­ter­na­tive en­ergy and car­bon cap­ture and stor­age and will soon be world lead­ers in this field. “When we get to 2020, the politi­cians in demo­cratic coun­tries will still be de­bat­ing whether The pro­fes­sor sees the slow­ness of demo­cratic process as a hin­der­ance to moves to change to grow and pro­tect the earth. China is said to be de­vel­op­ing cli­mate sav­ing means while grow­ing. we can af­ford mea­sures to cur­tail cli­mate change, but the Chi­nese will have solved the prob­lem by then. They will be sell­ing the so­lu­tion back to these democ­ra­cies.” Ran­ders says the Euro­pean Union (EU) Com­mis­sion, which by virtue of its struc­ture is rel­a­tively un­ham­pered by the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment, is also able to take de­ci­sive steps, as ev­i­denced by its bold an­nounce­ment that Europe will cut emis­sions by 20% by 2020, re­gard­less of whether oth­ers do. “Ask your­self: what is the com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor be­tween these two ex­am­ples?” says Ran­ders. “Both avoid the worst as­pects of demo­cratic gov­er­nance.” The chal­lenges fac­ing the world now are con­sid­er­able. The global econ­omy is set to quadru­ple in size by 2050. In the same time-frame, emis­sions must be re­duced by half to avoid widely pre­dicted and po­ten­tially cat­a­strophic tem­per­a­ture rises. This means that on av­er­age, all coun­tries and com­pa­nies need to re­duce green­house emis­sions per unit of value added (Geva) by 5% per an­num to know that they are “do­ing their bit”. But Ran­ders is pes­simistic that the de­ci­sions needed to af­fect these changes will be made so long as the demo­cratic process holds sway. He pre­dicts it will pre­vent gov­ern­ments from tak­ing a long-term view. He says that noth­ing short of a cri­sis will gal­vanise demo­cratic gov­ern­ments into ac­tion. In the mean­time, he says it is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of in­di­vid­u­als both per­son­ally and in busi­ness to em­u­late the ex­am­ples of China and the EU and start do­ing what they can to tackle the prob­lem. “You should all go out and grow like crazy, but just make sure you re­duce emis­sions per unit of value added,” he says.

za,Pretoria News,20150213,Gold de­mand con­tin­ues to fall,"GOLD de­mand fell for a third year on a slump in pur­chases from China, cost­ing the coun­try its place as the world’s big­gest buyer. Global de­mand slid 4 per­cent to a five-year low of 3 923.7 met­ric tons in 2014, the World Gold Coun­cil said in a re­port yes­ter­day. In China, pur­chases of bars and coins for in­vest­ment dropped by 50 per­cent and jew­ellery buy­ing re­treated from a record, ac­cord­ing to the Lon­don-based group. The strength­en­ing dollar and prospects for higher US in­ter­est rates have curbed gold’s ap­peal as a pro­tec­tion of wealth, lead­ing to two years of fall­ing prices. While the metal has re­bounded over the past three months, it is still within 10 per­cent of a four-year low. “2014 was a year of sta­bil­i­sa­tion,” Alis­tair He­witt, the head of mar­ket in­tel­li­gence at the coun­cil, said. “We saw bar and coin de­mand decline sub­stan­tially both in In­dia and China.” Gold rose 3.2 per­cent to $1 221.82 (R14 364) an ounce in Lon­don this year. In­dia took China’s spot as big­gest buyer of the metal, re­claim­ing the po­si­tion it last held in 2012, af­ter jew­ellery de­mand jumped to the high­est level since at least 1995. In­dia’s to­tal de­mand in 2014 was 842.7 tons, 14 per­cent lower on year, while China’s sank 38 per­cent to 813.6 tons, the re­port showed. Pur­chases of neck­laces, bracelets and ear­rings by In­dian shop­pers rose 8 per­cent even amid im­port re­stric­tions, while Chi­nese con­sumers bought 33 per­cent less. Com­bined bar and coin in­vest­ment was down 50 per­cent in both coun­tries.

za,Daily Dispatch,20170103,DA de­fends Tsh­wane mayor’s trip to Tai­wan,THE Demo­cratic Al­liance has ac­cused the ANC of not car­ing about in­vest­ment and jobs. This fol­lows crit­i­cism by the ANC of Tsh­wane mayor Solly Msi­manga for un­der­tak­ing a trip re­cently to Tai­wan to seek in­vest­ment op­portu charg­ing that the visit was in con­flict with South Africa’s recog­ni­tion of a One China pol­icy. The ANC was quoted yes­ter­day as say­ing that gov­ern­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tives who con­tra­vened na­tional for­eign pol­icy should have their of­fi­cial pass­ports con­fis­cated. Re­spond­ing to the ANC’s crit­i­cism‚ DA spokesman on in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and co­op­er­a­tion Stevens Mok­galapa said the ANC had again shown just how lit­tle it val­ued job-creating in­vest­ment in South Africa with its “petty‚ hyp­o­crit­i­cal at­tack” on Msi­manga. “With nine mil­lion job­less South Africans‚ the DA praises the at­tempt by mayor Msi­manga to en­cour­age in­vest­ment in South Africa. This is what our coun­try needs to cre­ate jobs and fight poverty. “The ANC should also be duly re­minded – so as to end their glar­ing hypocrisy – that South Africa main­tains re­la­tions with Tai­wan through the South African Li­ai­son Of­fice in Tai­wan.” The DA was com­mit­ted to creating jobs. “We will not let an un­car­ing‚ hyp­o­crit­i­cal ANC stand in the way of DA gov­ern­ments do­ing their job for all the peo­ple.”,南非
za,Pretoria News,20150213,Gold de­mand con­tin­ues to fall,"GOLD de­mand fell for a third year on a slump in pur­chases from China, cost­ing the coun­try its place as the world’s big­gest buyer. Global de­mand slid 4 per­cent to a five-year low of 3 923.7 met­ric tons in 2014, the World Gold Coun­cil said in a re­port yes­ter­day. In China, pur­chases of bars and coins for in­vest­ment dropped by 50 per­cent and jew­ellery buy­ing re­treated from a record, ac­cord­ing to the Lon­don-based group. The strength­en­ing dollar and prospects for higher US in­ter­est rates have curbed gold’s ap­peal as a pro­tec­tion of wealth, lead­ing to two years of fall­ing prices. While the metal has re­bounded over the past three months, it is still within 10 per­cent of a four-year low. “2014 was a year of sta­bil­i­sa­tion,” Alis­tair He­witt, the head of mar­ket in­tel­li­gence at the coun­cil, said. “We saw bar and coin de­mand decline sub­stan­tially both in In­dia and China.” Gold rose 3.2 per­cent to $1 221.82 (R14 364) an ounce in Lon­don this year. In­dia took China’s spot as big­gest buyer of the metal, re­claim­ing the po­si­tion it last held in 2012, af­ter jew­ellery de­mand jumped to the high­est level since at least 1995. In­dia’s to­tal de­mand in 2014 was 842.7 tons, 14 per­cent lower on year, while China’s sank 38 per­cent to 813.6 tons, the re­port showed. Pur­chases of neck­laces, bracelets and ear­rings by In­dian shop­pers rose 8 per­cent even amid im­port re­stric­tions, while Chi­nese con­sumers bought 33 per­cent less. Com­bined bar and coin in­vest­ment was down 50 per­cent in both coun­tries. It was too close to call which coun­try be­tween In­dia and China would be the big­gest buyer this year, with an­nual de­mand in both coun­tries fore­cast at 900 to 1 000 tons, He­witt said.

za,Sunday Tribune,20170820,Win-win for China-sa co-op­er­a­tion,"CHINA leads South Africa in many re­spects: size of pop­u­la­tion, coun­try and econ­omy. It has the world’s sec­ond­biggest econ­omy, but the jour­ney to pros­per­ity was not an overnight oc­cur­rence. In the late seven­ties the Chi­nese had one of the worstper­form­ing economies, with tens of mil­lions fac­ing star­va­tion, and had closed the door to in­vest­ment. Change be­gan in the late seven­ties when re­formist Deng Xiaop­ing came to power. He first dealt with the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. Food sup­plies and pro­duc­tion were alarm­ingly low. Fam­i­lies were given land to farm and the state took part of their pro­duce. They wel­comed in­vest­ment, eased trade pol­icy and looked at new en­ter­prises to de­liver op­por­tu­ni­ties. As they opened up, cap­i­tal, hu­man re­sources and tech­nol­ogy flowed in, en­abling the Chi­nese to re-in­dus­tri­alise and emerge with a gi­ant econ­omy. It’s a lesson for us. South Africa is much smaller, but faces sim­i­lar chal­lenges. We can learn from China’s ex­pe­ri­ence, in­clud­ing weigh­ing the cost of de­vel­op­ment against that of the en­vi­ron­ment, for ex­am­ple. We are at a de­vel­op­ment cross­roads with un­em­ploy­ment, a lack of skills, race-based in­equal­ity and an econ­omy only slowly tick­ing over. The govern­ment has de­vel­oped a num­ber of poli­cies, in­clud­ing the In­dus­trial Pol­icy Ac­tion Plan, to deal with eco­nomic and in­dus­trial growth chal­lenges and race-based poverty, in­equal­ity and un­em­ploy­ment. To achieve our goals, it has signed trade ex­changes and part­ner­ships. One of our great strate­gic part­ner­ships is the Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and SA al­liance (Brics). Brics is more than a trade plat­form; it’s where coun­tries learn from each other, cul­tural ex­changes take place, and a myr­iad ben­e­fi­cial re­la­tion­ships can be de­vel­oped. Last year in­tra-brics ex­ports were about R4tril­lion. China ac­counted for 40%, In­dia 27%, Rus­sia 16%, Brazil 10% and SA 7%. Mem­ber na­tions have dif­fer­ent ide­olo­gies and poli­cies, but what is im­por­tant is that we seek com­mon ground. We should en­sure the re­la­tion­ships are gen­uinely in­clu­sive and equally ben­e­fi­cial. China is SA’S big­gest trad­ing part­ner. We es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties in 1998, but even be­fore then the Anc-in-ex­ile en­gaged China for support and coun­sel. No­table mo­ments in­clude Oliver Tambo seek­ing support and coun­sel from China from the six­ties through to the mid-eight­ies. Clearly, the ba­sis for our brotherhood stretches far back. Ear­lier this year, China and SA es­tab­lished a peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change mech­a­nism. It en­cour­ages ex­changes in­volv­ing cul­ture, ed­u­ca­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tion, health, sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, sport, tourism, women and youth. As part of this, Chi­nese and African me­dia houses have co­op­er­ated more on in­for­ma­tion shar­ing, best prac­tice and train­ing. Speak­ing at the launch of the mech­a­nism, at a di­a­logue with the De­part­ment of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Co-op­er­a­tion this year, China’s Vice-pre­mier Liu Yan­dong pointed out the coun­tries shared the ideal of co-ex­is­tence, equal­ity and re­spon­si­bil­ity. Such pro­grammes are meant to find com­mon ground, im­prove our un­der­stand­ing and en­able us to work to­gether to tackle chal­lenges. SA im­ports more from China than China does from us. Our ex­ports to China in­clude iron ore, steel, man­ganese, chrome, to­bacco, wool, gran­ite, gold, cop­per, alu­minium and ve­hi­cle spares. We do ex­port man­u­fac­tured goods, but there is room to grow: agro-pro­cess­ing, chem­i­cal, ICT and elec­tronic com­pa­nies are well-placed to ex­port their goods and ser­vices. There’s room for a more bal­anced trade re­la­tion­ship and it should be ex­plored within the Brics frame­work. Our fi­nan­cial re­la­tion­ship is not just about im­ports and ex­ports. Much en­tails for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment – both ways. Ear­lier this month, China’s State Coun­cil an­nounced mea­sures for in­creased for­eign in­vest­ment. They will also make this en­vi­ron­ment more law-based, in­ter­na­tional and con­ve­nient. It is im­por­tant to the progress of both coun­tries’ low- to mid­dle-in­come groups that they con­sol­i­date as mid­dle-in­come coun­tries. It is a win­win sit­u­a­tion, in a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial en­vi­ron­ment, through poli­cies, par­tic­u­larly in the eco­nomic sphere, that will lead to de­vel­op­ment. Eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment is an im­por­tant in­gre­di­ent in build­ing so­cial co­he­sion, since it ul­ti­mately leads to peace, which, with de­vel­op­ment and co-op­er­a­tion, is im­por­tant to the suc­cess of emerg­ing mar­kets.

za,The Star Late Edition,20170425,"China, SA launch his­toric ex­change pro­gramme","A DEL­E­GA­TION of nine vice-min­is­ters from China ar­rived in our na­tion’s cap­i­tal to co-host the in­au­gu­ral launch of the China-South Africa high-level peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change mech­a­nism yes­ter­day. This makes South Africa the first African coun­try to set up such a mech­a­nism with China, which has launched sim­i­lar mech­a­nisms with the US, Russia, the UK, France, In­done­sia and the EU. The three-day peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change is be­ing co-hosted by the Vice-Pre­mier of the State Coun­cil of China, Liu Yan­dong, and Min­is­ter of Arts and Cul­ture Nathi Mthethwa. “Peo­ple-to-peo­ple re­la­tions are of­ten called soft diplo­macy. Learn­ing about each other’s world view, be­lief sys­tems and way of life is a crit­i­cal part of cre­at­ing a bet­ter world for all,” Mthethwa said at yes­ter­day’s in­au­gu­ral launch. “Cen­tral to our ef­forts in the field of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and diplo­macy is a no­tion of peo­ple-to peo­ple re­la­tions with part­ner coun­tries, jointly en­gag­ing each other and deep­en­ing our un­der­stand­ing of our­selves. Civil so­ci­ety is cen­tral to the re­al­i­sa­tion of this goal,” he said. The two coun­tries hope that the mech­a­nism will deepen mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween the peo­ple of South Africa and China, and en­hance peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes and co-op­er­a­tion in the ar­eas of cul­ture, ed­u­ca­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tions, health, sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, sport, tourism, women and youth. In her key­note speech, Liu lauded the set­ting up of the mech­a­nism by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma as a vi­sion­ary de­ci­sion that marked a mile­stone in the his­tory of ties be­tween the two coun­tries. “At Fo­cac (Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion), we agreed to up­grade re­la­tions to a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic and co-op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship. We should pur­sue closer cul­tural in­ter­ac­tions, policy co-or­di­na­tion, and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes to ad­vance com­mon progress,” she said. Liu high­lighted the long his­tory be­tween the civil­i­sa­tions of China and mod­ern-day South Africa. “Ceram­ics from China were found on the site of the an­cient King­dom of Ma­pun­gubwe, which flour­ished 1 000 years ago in what is to­day South Africa,” Liu said. She also noted that dur­ing the anti-apartheid Strug­gle, Chair­man Mao Ze­dong cared about the fight against racist rule, and in May 1954 sent a mes­sage ex­press­ing China’s full sup­port for the Strug­gle. The two coun­tries es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties in 1998, and re­la­tions have gone from strength to strength, with China hav­ing been South Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner for eight-con­sec­u­tive years. There is a two-way trade vol­ume of $35.3 bil­lion (R450bn). Peo­ple-to-peo­ple re­la­tions have been growing, with in­creas­ing num­bers of Chi­nese stu­dents study­ing in South Africa, the estab­lish­ment of Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes, as well as sis­ter prov­inces and cities. South Africa is the first coun­try in Africa to in­clude Chi­nese teach­ing in its ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem. Many South Africans have be­come fans of Chi­nese mar­tial arts and Pek­ing Opera. Sim­i­larly, South African dance and wine have be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar with Chi­nese, and a 2015 doc­u­men­tary re­leased in Beijing high­lighted the sto­ries of the growing num­ber of South Africans liv­ing in China. Fur­ther ce­ment­ing be­tween the two coun­tries is seen as win-win co-op­er­a­tion, and South Africa can ben­e­fit from China’s ex­pe­ri­ence in lift­ing 700 mil­lion of its peo­ple out of poverty – 10 mil­lion of them last year alone. Liu shared with her South African col­leagues that China in­tended to cre­ate 50 mil­lion new ur­ban jobs over the next five years. The shar­ing of this type of in­no­va­tion and de­vel­op­men­tal plan­ning has been wel­comed by South African min­is­ters who will par­tic­i­pate in the his­toric ex­change over the com­ing days. The vice-pre­mier con­cluded her re­marks with the African proverb: “When spi­ders unite they can tie down a lion,” in con­junc­tion with the Chi­nese proverb: “When brothers are of the same mind, they can break metal.” Both vividly tell a sim­ple truth: that only through win­win co-op­er­a­tion can we make big achieve­ments that de­liver long-term ben­e­fits. ‘Learn­ing about the other’s world view is crit­i­cal’",南非
za,The Star Early Edition,20180705,PRO­MOT­ING BRICS CO-OP­ER­A­TION,"IT’S A great plea­sure to meet with so many friends in the beau­ti­ful coun­try of South Africa to dis­cuss the BRICS coun­tries’ ex­pe­ri­ence in gov­er­nance. Jo­han­nes­burg is known as the “City of Gold”, and to­day we are gath­ered here to ex­change ideas, learn from each other, and find the “true gold” of gov­er­nance wis­dom. On be­half of the Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, I would like to ex­tend my con­grat­u­la­tions to the open­ing of the sem­i­nar, and my deep grat­i­tude to our host – the South African Na­tional School of Govern­ment – as well as to other par­ties for their great ef­forts for pre­par­ing for the sem­i­nar. In re­sponse to the call made by BRICS lead­ers to strengthen the ex­change of state gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence, the Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee suc­cess­fully held the first BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance in Quanzhou, Fu­jian Province, the im­por­tant start­ing point of the Mar­itime Silk Road, in Septem­ber last year. Participants at the sem­i­nar reached the Quanzhou Con­sen­sus of BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, which was in­cluded in the BRICS Lead­ers Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion. The Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion ex­pressly noted the progress made by BRICS coun­tries in the ex­changes and co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing gov­er­nance, film-mak­ing, me­dia, and think-tanks. The Dec­la­ra­tion added: “We ap­pre­ci­ate China’s suc­cess­ful host­ing of the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, and will carry th­ese fruit­ful ini­tia­tives for­ward in the fu­ture.” The BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 held in South Africa is a con­crete step to im­ple­ment the re­sults of BRICS lead­ers’ meet­ing in Xi­a­men, and to honor our agree­ment in Quanzhou. I’m glad that you have all come here as we promised. The theme of this year’s sem­i­nar is “Con­tribut­ing BRICS’ Wis­dom to Global Gov­er­nance in the In­ter­ests of the Peo­ple”. It re­flects the com­mon wish of govern­ment lead­ers, think tank mem­bers, and cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives in the “BRICS Plus” com­mu­nity to pro­mote BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and ben­e­fit the peo­ple of BRICS coun­tries, and will have pro­found im­pact on be­gin­ning the sec­ond “golden decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. I be­lieve your di­a­logues and in-depth ex­changes around the sem­i­nar theme will lead to bountiful re­sults. The peo­ple are the own­ers of so­ci­ety, and the count­less work­ers rep­re­sent the di­rec­tion of his­tor­i­cal de­vel­op­ment and progress. To truly ben­e­fit the peo­ple, con­tin­u­ously im­prove their lives, and strive for na­tional de­vel­op­ment and progress through their ef­forts – this is the ul­ti­mate yard­stick to mea­sure a party’s gov­ern­ing per­for­mance. The Com­mu­nist Party of China is the rul­ing party of a na­tion that has a pop­u­la­tion of more than 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple. The peo­ple stand for the orig­i­nal as­pi­ra­tion and mis­sion of the party, and the party al­ways stands with the peo­ple, thinks about the peo­ple, and works for the peo­ple. This year marks the 40th an­niver­sary of China’s re­form and open­ing up. In the past 40 years, the Chi­nese econ­omy and so­ci­ety have un­der­gone tremen­dous changes, and the Chi­nese peo­ple’s lives have con­sid­er­ably im­proved, from in­suf­fi­ciency and poverty to af­flu­ence and gen­er­ally mod­er­ate pros­per­ity. Ac­cord­ing to cur­rent UN stan­dards, China has lifted more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, ac­count­ing for more than 70% of the global poverty re­duc­tion in the same pe­riod. This is a re­mark­able achieve­ment. Af­ter the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress in 2012, the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core has es­tab­lished the peo­ple-cen­tered de­vel­op­ment thought. We take the peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tion for a good life as our goal, im­ple­ment the “peo­ple first” con­cept in all gov­ern­ing work, keep push­ing for­ward so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, and strive for his­toric achieve­ments in the Party’s and na­tion’s un­der­tak­ings. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era has been formed and a new realm in the gov­er­nance of con­tem­po­rary China has been cre­ated. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era is the gen­er­al­i­sa­tion of the gov­ern­ing con­cepts and strate­gies up­held by the CPC and the Chi­nese govern­ment. With the peo­ple as its most dis­tinct po­lit­i­cal stance and purest af­fec­tion, it is the key to the de­vel­op­ment and progress of con­tem­po­rary China. Here I want to share with you some of my ob­ser­va­tions. First, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” value ori­en­ta­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has formed deep and nat­u­ral bonds with the peo­ple. He cares about their hap­pi­ness and sad­ness, speaks for them, and stands up for them. He re­peat­edly em­pha­sized that “win­ning the peo­ple’s sup­port is our big­gest po­lit­i­cal task”, “the peo­ple are whom we rely on”, “en­sur­ing a good life for the peo­ple is the start­ing point and ob­jec­tive of all our work”, and “no one should be left be­hind on the way to mod­er­ate pros­per­ity”. Pres­i­dent Xi made a re­port at the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress in Oc­to­ber last year, in which he men­tioned “the peo­ple” more than 200 times. He has set an ex­am­ple for car­ing for the peo­ple, and has trav­elled nearly all over the coun­try, in­clud­ing all of the ex­tremely poor ar­eas. It’s safe to say that the CPC’s “peo­ple first” con­cept has be­come a pow­er­ful force that keeps all Chi­nese peo­ple united and will help re­alise the Chi­nese Dream. Sec­ond, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” pol­icy di­rec­tion. “All our poli­cies must be aimed to meet the peo­ple’s needs”. The CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core takes “peo­ple cen­trism” as the guid­ance of gov­er­nance, pro­motes the five-sphere in­te­grated plan in a holis­tic way and the four-pronged com­pre­hen­sive strat­egy in a co­or­di­nated way, im­ple­ments new de­vel­op­ment con­cept, deep­ens the sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form, and car­ries out the ru­ral re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion strat­egy, etc. Th­ese sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ing strate­gies are all aimed to im­prove the peo­ple’s wel­fare, boost the mod­erni­sa­tion drive, and push for all-round de­vel­op­ment of the peo­ple and the so­ci­ety. In the past five-plus years, China has im­ple­mented a large num­ber of mea­sures for peo­ple’s wel­fare, lifted over 60 mil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple out of poverty, and re­duced the poverty in­ci­dence from 10.2% to less than 4%. Ed­u­ca­tion de­vel­oped across the board and ed­u­ca­tion in the cen­tral and western re­gions and ru­ral ar­eas was re­mark­ably im­proved; em­ploy­ment im­proved and over 13 mil­lion peo­ple found jobs in cities an­nu­ally; in­come of ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents in­creased faster than eco­nomic growth and the mid­dle-in­come group con­tin­ued to ex­pand; the so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem that cov­ers all ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents was ba­si­cally es­tab­lished, and peo­ple’s health and med­i­cal ser­vice were largely bet­tered, giv­ing them a stronger sense of gain, hap­pi­ness, and se­cu­rity. Third, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” eval­u­a­tion cri­te­rion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping stressed that “the time gives us the test pa­per, we an­swer the pa­per, and the peo­ple grade the pa­per”. The CPC makes great ef­forts to make our re­form and de­vel­op­ment achieve­ments more ac­ces­si­ble to all peo­ple, and takes the peo­ple’s at­ti­tude – their sup­port, ap­proval, sat­is­fac­tion, and en­dorse­ment – as the fun­da­men­tal cri­te­rion for gov­er­nance. Af­ter the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress, the Chi­nese govern­ment has con­stantly set new records in its “gov­ern­ing per­for­mance sheet”. By 2017, China’s GDP reached RMB82.7 tril­lion, con­tin­u­ing to rank sec­ond in the world and driv­ing global eco­nomic growth. The re­port of the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress pointed out that the prin­ci­pal con­tra­dic­tion fac­ing Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved to “the con­tra­dic­tion be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life”. The Chi­nese govern­ment will work hard to adapt to the new change in the prin­ci­pal so­cial con­tra­dic­tion in the new era, launch more projects and mea­sures for im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare, and bet­ter meet the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs in eco­nomic, cul­tural, so­cial, and eco­log­i­cal sec­tors. We will ac­cept the eval­u­a­tion and ex­am­i­na­tion of “peo­ple graders” with full con­fi­dence. Fourth, we should pro­mote the build­ing of a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind with peo­ple at the cen­tre. The world is in a pe­riod of big de­vel­op­ment, big re­form, and big ad­just­ment, with prom­i­nent in­sta­bil­ity and un­cer­tainty. Based on his pro­found in­sight and wise think­ing about hu­man des­tiny, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping put forth China’s as­ser­tion of build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind and forg­ing a new model of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. The orig­i­nal logic for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind is “putting the peo­ple at the cen­tre”. The world is a global vil­lage, where peo­ples of all coun­tries live un­der the same sky and share the same home. We should act as a fam­ily. The dream of the Chi­nese peo­ple is closely con­nected with the dreams of the peo­ples of other coun­tries. China will stay on the path of peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, carry out a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial strat­egy of open­ing up, up­hold jus­tice while pur­su­ing shared in­ter­ests, and pur­sue open, in­no­va­tive, and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment that ben­e­fits ev­ery­one. We will boost cross-cul­tural ex­changes char­ac­terised by har­mony with­out uni­for­mity, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tual learn­ing, cul­ti­vate ecosys­tems based on re­spect for na­ture and green de­vel­op­ment, and con­tinue the ef­forts to safe­guard world peace, con­trib­ute to global de­vel­op­ment, and up­hold in­ter­na­tional or­der. Our call for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind has re­ceived pos­i­tive re­sponses from many coun­tries in the world and has been in­cluded in sev­eral UN res­o­lu­tions. The past decade has seen the BRICS coun­tries mak­ing bril­liant achieve­ments, with more prom­i­nent in­ter­na­tional po­si­tion and in­creas­ing global in­flu­ence. The com­bined GDP of the five BRICS coun­tries has grown by al­most 180%, their to­tal trade vol­ume by 94%, and con­tri­bu­tion to world eco­nomic growth by more than 50%. BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has formed a multi-layer and all-round frame­work cov­er­ing a wide range of ar­eas, in­clud­ing pol­i­tics, econ­omy, fi­nance, trade, so­cial de­vel­op­ment, and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change. It has be­come a co-op­er­a­tion plat­form with global in­flu­ence and a cru­cial mech­a­nism for South-South co-op­er­a­tion, with its sig­nif­i­cance far be­yond the five mem­ber coun­tries. Th­ese achieve­ments are at­trib­uted to our ad­her­ence to the BRICS spirit of open­ness, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion, which en­sures our sound and sus­tained co-op­er­a­tion pace and cease­less co-op­er­a­tion out­comes; to our ex­er­cis­ing the con­cept of global gov­er­nance fea­tur­ing wide con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri­bu­tion, and shared ben­e­fits, sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to proac­tively take part in the re­form and con­struc­tion of the global gov­er­nance sys­tem, and con­stantly con­tribut­ing BRICS wis­dom and strength; and to our value ori­en­ta­tion of safe­guard­ing the peo­ple’s in­ter­ests, pri­or­ity to de­vel­op­ment, per­fec­tion of gov­er­nance, and ef­forts to im­prove the peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare. At the same time, we must see that the world to­day is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes, eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion is en­coun­ter­ing re­sis­tance, trade pro­tec­tion­ism is ris­ing, a cer­tain coun­try is mak­ing ir­re­spon­si­ble poli­cies and tak­ing mea­sures to start trade dis­putes, and the global multi-lat­eral trade sys­tem is harmed se­verely. Due to in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal fac­tors, the eco­nomic growth of BRICS coun­tries is fac­ing new chal­lenges. Some peo­ple take the chance to as­sert that the BRICS coun­tries are los­ing lus­tre and make bear­ish fore­cast about their co-op­er­a­tion and the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Un­der such cir­cum­stance, it is more im­per­a­tive for us to re­main con­fi­dent and stead­fast, ex­pand the co-op­er­a­tion scope while fo­cus­ing on win­win ar­eas, deepen our part­ner­ships, and con­sol­i­date and ex­pand the BRICS’ cir­cle of friends. Through th­ese ef­forts, we strive to form a new sit­u­a­tion of com­mon progress and de­vel­op­ment, and show the world that the BRICS coun­tries re­main “true gold”. China is a firm sup­porter of and par­tic­i­pant in the BRICS mech­a­nism and takes BRICS co-op­er­a­tion as an im­por­tant part of its diplo­macy. At the ple­nary ses­sion of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit last year, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping solemnly de­clared that “China will launch the BRICS Eco­nomic and Tech­ni­cal Co-op­er­a­tion Plan with RMB500 mil­lion in the first stage to fa­cil­i­tate pol­icy ex­change and prac­ti­cal co-op­er­a­tion in eco­nomic and trade ar­eas. It will also con­trib­ute USD4 mil­lion to the NDB prepa­ra­tion fund to sup­port its busi­ness op­er­a­tions and long-term de­vel­op­ment”. Th­ese mea­sures will gen­er­ate a strong mo­men­tum to kick off the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We be­lieve that the co-op­er­a­tion of BRICS coun­tries will bring more tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits to over 3 bil­lion peo­ple and strongly pro­mote world peace, sta­bil­ity, and pros­per­ity. Think tanks are the brain trust of gov­er­nance. Their ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance and mu­tual learn­ing is of great sig­nif­i­cance for BRICS coun­tries to achieve greater de­vel­op­ment in the fu­ture. To­day, the Sand­ton Con­ven­tion Cen­tre is full of dis­tin­guished guests, in­clud­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from es­tab­lished think tanks and schol­ars with ad­vanced at­tain­ment from BRICS coun­tries and Africa. We have rea­sons to be­lieve that this is go­ing to be a grand gala of thoughts and ideas. I would like to take this op­por­tu­nity to pro­pose some sug­ges­tions for your ref­er­ence. First, we need to fol­low the prin­ci­ple of equal­ity and mu­tual trust. BRICS coun­tries are in sim­i­lar de­vel­op­ment stages with the same de­vel­op­ment goals even though our na­tional con­di­tions are dif­fer­ent. Al­though the think tanks here vary in strength and scale, they have re­spec­tive ex­per­tise and share the same goal of boost­ing BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. We will have di­ver­gences dur­ing the ex­change and dis­cus­sion due to dif­fer­ent na­tional con­di­tions, his­tory, and cul­ture, etc. How­ever, as long as we re­spect each other’s de­vel­op­ment path, treat each other equally, seek com­mon ground while shelv­ing dif­fer­ences, en­hance mu­tual trust while dis­pelling doubts, and ac­com­mo­date each other’s con­cerns, we will have a good pre­con­di­tion for di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion, a solid foun­da­tion for pro­mot­ing prag­matic co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous fields, and a bright prospect for the ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance among BRICS coun­tries. Sec­ond, we need to fo­cus on the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Think tanks are the highland of ideas and tal­ent with dis­tinc­tive in­tel­li­gence ad­van­tages. Since the sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has be­gun, think tanks should be participants as well as sug­ges­tion and ser­vice providers. They should sum­marise the law of his­tory, an­a­lyse the gen­eral trend of de­vel­op­ment, study the com­mon dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing BRICS coun­tries, and of­fer sug­ges­tions for the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. To im­ple­ment the fruits of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit, China has ear­marked a spe­cial fund to en­cour­age and sup­port think tanks from dif­fer­ent coun­tries to con­duct re­search on BRICS gov­er­nance, which will be un­der­taken by China Foreign Lan­guages Pub­lish­ing Ad­min­is­tra­tion, one of the hosts of this sem­i­nar. Think tank rep­re­sen­ta­tives here are wel­come to work with the CIPG. Third, we need to en­sure deep and prag­matic dis­cus­sion and ex­change. The sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion will be more vig­or­ous and dy­namic, dur­ing which the BRICS think tanks should fol­low the trend, in­crease in­ter­ac­tions and ex­changes, deepen our friend­ship, and pur­sue com­mon de­vel­op­ment. The suc­cess of this sem­i­nar in South Africa will sig­nal that the BRICS’ gov­er­nance com­mu­ni­ca­tion has be­come a reg­u­lar mech­a­nism within the frame­work of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. It is widely hoped that the sem­i­nar will closely fol­low the BRICS Sum­mit and be held an­nu­ally in the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency, where we will put forth our ideas and sug­ges­tions around the theme of the Sum­mit, and make think tank co-op­er­a­tion a high­light of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We should trans­late the fruits of the Sem­i­nar into ac­tion by com­mu­ni­cat­ing the fruits widely to build con­sen­sus among peo­ple from all walks of life and in­flu­enc­ing govern­ment de­ci­sions pos­i­tively. The Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee will con­tinue to sup­port the ex­change and co-op­er­a­tion among BRICS me­dia to pro­mote the out­comes of the gov­er­nance sem­i­nar and help put them into prac­tice. As a Chi­nese proverb goes, “the fire burns high when every­body adds wood to it”, and an African proverb goes “one log can’t make a house”. The spark of in­tel­li­gence will only burst into bril­liant light when gath­ered in large quan­tity. We sin­cerely hope that you will can­didly share ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­change views with an open mind, reach more con­sen­suses, and gain more in­sight. Fi­nally, I wish the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 a great suc­cess.",南非
za,Cape Times,20190214,"China’s eco­nomic slump is a re­sult of favour­ing SOEs over pri­vate en­ter­prise, writes Kabelo Khu­malo |","THE UNIMAG­IN­ABLE has hap­pened. The Chi­nese econ­omy in 2018 slowed to its low­est level in nearly three decades, leav­ing pun­dits to try to fig­ure out how deep the slump is. This means Bei­jing en­tered this week’s trade talks with the US in an un­fa­mil­iar po­si­tion: that of vul­ner­a­bil­ity. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump would have us be­lieve that China’s down­turn was largely due to the bar­rage of tar­iffs he un­leashed on the US’s eco­nomic ri­val. This is not nec­es­sar­ily true. China is now a mid­dle-in­come coun­try and it was im­pos­si­ble for it to main­tain dou­ble-digit growth in­def­i­nitely. It is not just the pace, but the na­ture of the Chi­nese econ­omy that has changed, mean­ing that the coun­try has to tra­verse a dif­fi­cult po­lit­i­cal av­enue: to re­form and open up the econ­omy to make it more pro­duc­tive. Herein are lessons for the South African econ­omy and the pal­pa­ble para­noia over the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of our state-owned en­ti­ties (SOEs). South Africa’s SOEs have meta­mor­phosed into state-owned prob­lems, with tax­pay­ers left to foot the com­pa­nies’ grow­ing bills. SOEs have time and time again proved not to be a sound in­vest­ment. Deng Xiaop­ing’s 1978 re­forms gave China eco­nomic might, build­ing from scratch a prof­itable pri­vate sec­tor that saw mil­lions of peo­ple lifted out of poverty. How­ever, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has re­fo­cused his ad­min­is­tra­tion on build­ing up state-owned com­pa­nies. For ex­am­ple, in 2016, pri­vate firms held 11 per­cent of new loans, while state-owned com­pa­nies got 83 per­cent in new loans. This is in stark con­trast to the 2010 pic­ture where pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies got 43 per­cent of loans and state com­pa­nies had a 36 per­cent share of new loans that year. China’s debt is pub­lic, not pri­vate, which means that the risks are largely borne by the state. What is clear is that while Chi­nese lead­ers have called for a re­form of its SOEs, the re­forms have largely meant the strength­en­ing of the com­pa­nies and not break­ing their stran­gle­hold on the econ­omy. The SOEs touch ev­ery sec­tor of the Chi­nese econ­omy, rang­ing from telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion to fi­nance. When China joined the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, it gave an un­der­tak­ing to open it­self up to for­eign­ers in lu­cra­tive busi­nesses like bank­ing, tele­coms and elec­tronic-pay­ment pro­cess­ing. How­ever, nearly two decades later, China’s tele­coms in­dus­try is still firmly un­der gov­ern­ment con­trol. Be­cause Chi­nese state com­pa­nies en­joy un­fil­tered easy ac­cess to state as­sis­tance and loans, they amassed as­sets that make the pri­vate sec­tor find it harder to com­pete. How­ever, with data in­di­cat­ing that China’s pri­vate sec­tor is con­tribut­ing 60 per­cent of the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and 80 per­cent of em­ploy­ment, Bei­jing is in­creas­ingly aware it can no longer favour state com­pa­nies over the pri­vate sec­tor. Xi last year ad­mit­ted as much: “We will re­in­force the de­vel­op­ment of the state econ­omy while guid­ing the de­vel­op­ment of the non-state econ­omy,” he said. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties like the Eco­nomic Free­dom Fight­ers and for­ma­tions like Cosatu, Numsa and the South African Com­mu­nist Party frown on the word “pri­vati­sa­tion”. The move­ments be­lieve the fu­ture is red and that the mar­ket econ­omy should be reined in as it has led to inequal­ity. But how does it profit the South African econ­omy and its peo­ple to keep cash-burn­ing en­ti­ties like Eskom, South African Air­ways and PetroSA in op­er­a­tion? The in­sis­tence that we own as­sets like Eskom and SAA is akin to a man who stub­bornly re­fuses to let go of a run-down BMW he has owned for 30 years, hop­ing to pass it on in­tact to his beloved son. It would ap­pear our SOEs are in a dog­fight to show which one will be the big­gest bur­den and em­bar­rass­ment to the coun­try. The num­bers speak for them­selves. The gov­ern­ment’s ex­po­sure to SOE debt has risen from R160 bil­lion in 2011 to R308bn in 2017, while Eskom’s debt reached 8.5 per­cent of GDP late last year. Num­bers from S&amp;P Global Rat­ings are even more fright­en­ing. S&amp;P, see gov­ern­ment guar­an­tees for SOEs’ debt ris­ing to R500bn by 2020, or 10 per­cent of GDP. It has be­come near im­pos­si­ble for the Na­tional Trea­sury to keep to its fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion path while bail­ing out our ail­ing SOEs. The stub­born in­sis­tence that we stay in abu­sive re­la­tion­ships with our un­der­per­form­ing SOEs means that, in the end, the poor and work­ing class, whom anti-pri­vati­sa­tion cru­saders want to pro­tect, will them­selves be state-owned; for­ever be­holden to the state to eke out a liv­ing.",南非
za,Pretoria News,20110412,China’s pork binge will en­sure soya beans fetch a pre­mium,"ALL THE soya beans in Iowa won’t be enough to meet the an­tic­i­pated surge in China’s im­ports over the next four years as the nation feeds a record pig herd and drives bean prices to an all-time high. China, which has dou­bled meat con­sump­tion in the past two decades, may boost in­ter­na­tional soya bean pur­chases by 33 per­cent to 66.9 mil­lion tons by 2014, a 16.6 mil­lion-ton in­crease that is more than Iowa, the largest US grower, pro­duced last year, gov­ern­ment data show. US farm­ers are cut­ting back on plant­ing, mean­ing prices will rise 21 per­cent to $16.80 a bushel (R4 066 a ton) by De­cem­ber 31, an an­a­lyst sur­vey shows. Al­most half the world’s pork comes from China, which has 689 mil­lion pigs and will be re­spon­si­ble for all of this year’s in­crease in global sup­ply, the US Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture (USDA) es­ti­mates. That is adding to China’s de­pen­dence on raw ma­te­rial im­ports from Brazil to Aus­tralia to the US, mak­ing it vul­ner­a­ble to in­fla­tion that Premier Wen Ji­abao has pledged to com­bat with­out de­rail­ing eco­nomic growth. “China is build­ing a live­stock and meat in­dus­try in five years that took the US 50 years,” said Michael Swan­son, the se­nior agri­cul­tural econ­o­mist in Min­neapo­lis for San Fran­cisco-based Wells Fargo. “US farm trade with China may dou­ble in the next five years.” The 13-fold ex­pan­sion in China’s econ­omy in the past two decades has meant an al­most dou­bling in meat con­sump­tion by the coun­try’s 1.34 bil­lion peo­ple, World Bank and gov­ern­ment data show. While the US trade deficit with China widened by about 13 per­cent to $23.3 bil­lion in Jan­uary, ex­ports of US farm goods are the high­est ever and the Asian nation is the top cus­tomer. China may in­crease soya bean im­ports to 68 mil­lion tons by 2014, a 17.7 mil­lion ton in­crease from last year that would ex­ceed the pur­chases fore­cast by the USDA, ac­cord­ing to Grant Kim­ber­ley, the di­rec­tor of mar­ket pro­mo­tion for the Iowa Soy­bean As­so­ci­a­tion. Farm­ers in the state reaped 13.5 mil­lion tons in 2010. China con­sumes one in ev­ery four tons pro­duced glob­ally. It takes about 2.8 kilo­grams of feed to pro­duce one kilo­gram of pork, ac­cord­ing to the Amer­i­can Soy­bean As­so­ci­a­tion. In­creased meat pro­duc­tion and de­mand for feed is com­ing at a time of near­record global food prices that con­trib­uted to protests across north­ern Africa and the Mid­dle East, top­pling lead­ers in Egypt and Tu­nisia. Ris­ing prices had pushed about 44 mil­lion peo­ple into poverty since June last year, the World Bank said in Fe­bru­ary. Soya beans are lit­tle changed on the Chicago Board of Trade this year and were at $14.08 a bushel at 1.30pm in Sin­ga­pore, com­pared with a 25 per­cent surge in maize and a 43 per­cent ad­vance in cot­ton. That is spurring US farm­ers, the world’s largest grow­ers and ex­porters, to sow the fewest acres with soya beans in three years, the USDA es­ti­mates. When the har­vest be­gins in Septem­ber, US stock­piles will be enough to cover 15 days of de­mand, the fewest since 1965. China will im­port a record 57 mil­lion tons in the 12 months to Oc­to­ber, more than twice the amount five years ago and 60 per­cent of the global to­tal, the USDA es­ti­mates. As do­mes­tic agri­cul­tural out­put failed to keep pace with de­mand last year, China’s im­ports jumped 34 per­cent to $17.52bn. Pork ac­counts for about three-quar­ters of Chinese meat de­mand, the USDA es­ti­mates. “China will be a grow­ing mar­ket for the next decade,” said Kim­ber­ley, who farms 1 619ha with his fa­ther in Maxwell, Iowa, and spent 10 days in China last month with pro­ces­sors, im­porters and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials. “Chinese peo­ple are be­com­ing more af­flu­ent and want to eat more meat.” Ef­forts to curb in­fla­tion may slow growth. The Peo­ple’s Bank of China raised in­ter­est rates for a fourth time in six months on April 5, be­fore a re­port that is fore­cast to show con­sumer prices climbed 5.2 per­cent last month from a year ear­lier, the fastest pace since 2008. Food in­fla­tion reached 11 per­cent in Fe­bru­ary, gov­ern­ment data show. Wen’s goal is a 4 per­cent rate. The gov­ern­ment has been sell­ing soya beans from state stock­piles af­ter spot prices climbed 19 per­cent in the past year in the city of Dalian. Whole­sale pork prices in China have surged 40 per­cent since May last year and the av­er­age per­son in China will con­sume a record 39.3kg of pork this year, com­pared with 19.7kg in 1990, based on USDA es­ti­mates. – Bloomberg",南非
za,Daily News,20181123,LES­SONS FOR WEST IN CURB­ING TER­ROR­ISM,"RE­CENTLY some Western politi­cians and me­dia, in dis­re­gard of the facts, have launched crit­i­cism that the vo­ca­tional tech­ni­cal train­ing pro­grammes car­ried out by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in Xin­jiang are “eth­nic seg­re­ga­tion”, “re­li­gious per­se­cu­tion”, “re-ed­u­ca­tion camps”, and “vi­o­la­tions against hu­man rights”. This is a bare-faced lie. Xin­jiang is an in­alien­able part of China. The mi­nor­ity eth­nic pop­u­la­tion en­joy full re­li­gious free­dom as ev­i­denced by 24400 mosques, more than dou­ble the num­ber of mosques in the US (around 2000), UK (1750), Ger­many (3000) and France (2500). Over the past sev­eral years, as­sisted by the in­dul­gence and provo­ca­tion by some anti-China forces, some eth­nic sep­a­ratists, re­li­gious ex­trem­ists, and ter­ror­ists within and out­side China have car­ried out ter­ror­ist at­tacks in­volv­ing bomb­ings, as­sas­si­na­tions, poi­son­ing, ar­son at­tacks, and pub­lic ri­ots, tak­ing the lives of nu­mer­ous in­no­cent mem­bers of the pub­lic, in­clud­ing hun­dreds of po­lice. This has gravely threat­ened the sta­bil­ity and har­mony of the so­ci­ety, and tram­pled on the ba­sic hu­man rights of all eth­nic groups in Xin­jiang. In the face of these atroc­i­ties, some peo­ple still liv­ing with the Cold War men­tal­ity in the West have failed to ex­press due con­dem­na­tion. Some have en­cour­aged these hor­ri­ble acts. This is dou­ble stan­dards by the West. We be­lieve any­one who is fa­mil­iar with na­tional laws, has good pro­fes­sional knowl­edge and ex­per­tise, and has a de­cent job and fam­ily will not eas­ily fall for ter­ror­ism or re­li­gious ex­trem­ism. The root cause of ter­ror­ism is poverty. The key to elim­i­nat­ing ter­ror­ism is The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has ac­tively cre­ated a new model of coun­tert­er­ror­ism mainly fo­cused on preven­tion to ac­cel­er­ate devel­op­ment in Xin­jiang, so as to pro­vide ev­ery­one, the youth in par­tic­u­lar, de­cent work, in­come and fam­ily life. This is fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent from the Western ap­proach of fight­ing vi­o­lence with vi­o­lence to up­root ter­ror­ism. On the one hand, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to fight­ing fiercely against ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lent crimes ac­cord­ing to law, ef­fec­tively pro­tect­ing the ba­sic hu­man rights of all cit­i­zens, firmly up­hold­ing so­cial sta­bil­ity in Xin­jiang, and pro­vid­ing in­ten­sive pol­icy sup­port and cre­at­ing con­di­tions to sup­port fast devel­op­ment in the re­gion. On the other hand, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has been ac­tively cre­at­ing a new model of counter-ter­ror­ism mainly fo­cused on preven­tion. We have es­tab­lished vo­ca­tional tech­ni­cal train­ing schools to of­fer free train­ing pro­grammes for lo­cal youths, in­clud­ing those who have com­mit­ted mi­nor of­fences but have been ex­empted from crim­i­nal pun­ish­ment.

za,The Star Late Edition,20181107,CAPE TRANS­PORT IN­VEST­MENT IS IM­PER­A­TIVE,"RE­CENTLY China opened the world’s longest sea bridge. Of­fi­cially called the Hong Kong-Ma­cau-Zhuhai bridge, the struc­ture, which cost $20 bil­lion (about R285bn), is about 55km long and while for the most part it crosses wa­ter, it also has a 7km tun­nel. The con­struc­tion of the bridge took eight years, and now con­nects main­land China (Zhuhai) to the semi­au­tonomous re­gions of Hong Kong and Ma­cau. Be­fore the bridge was built, it took three hours to travel be­tween Zhuhai and Hong Kong. Now it takes 30 min­utes. By build­ing this bridge it is sug­gested that Bei­jing seeks to en­sure that the Greater Bay Area be­comes a tech­no­log­i­cal and in­no­va­tion-fo­cused zone. Au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing sug­gest that by 2030, nearly 30 000 ve­hi­cles and nearly 130 000 pas­sen­ger trips would utilise the bridge daily. Most im­por­tantly, it in­te­grates the three ter­ri­to­ries and gives life to the “One China” pol­icy. China, a de­vel­op­ing coun­try once plagued with op­pres­sion, in­equal­ity, dis­ease, famine and poverty, has now emerged as a de­vel­oped na­tion. As we en­ter a new phase of glob­al­i­sa­tion and with the on­set of the fourth in­dus­trial revo­lu­tion, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, at the 13th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress in 2017, in­tro­duced the Xi Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era. Meet­ing with 13 African heads of state on the side­lines of his first BRICS Sum­mit in SA in 2013, Xi em­pha­sised the need for in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture on the African con­ti­nent. This is not far from the em­pha­sis placed on the in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture by the AU’s Agenda 2063. By us­ing it­self as a roadmap, China, Xi pointed out, wished to en­sure that African peo­ple them­selves were in­ter­con­nected and en­abled to con­nect with each other. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices … SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude of peo­ple cen­tred de­vel­op­ment A num­ber of ex­press high­ways have been ini­ti­ated and built on the African con­ti­nent. For ex­am­ple, the $476m ex­press high­way be­tween Kam­pala and En­tebbe in Uganda, and the Omakange and Rua­cana road up­grade in Namibia. Sadly, SA’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem is not a peo­ple-cen­tred oper­a­tion. Even the last mega projects, the Gau­train and the roads in Gaut­eng, have sadly placed profit and “sus­tain­abil­ity” as core pri­or­i­ties. In par­tic­u­lar, Prasa and Metro­rail have had a chal­lenge with the on­slaught of at­tacks against their rail­way in­fra­struc­ture in the Western Cape. Metro­rail, to­gether with na­tional, pro­vin­cial and lo­cal govern­ment, has launched the rail­way en­force­ment unit in Cape Town. Ac­cord­ing to news re­ports, the pri­or­ity of this unit is not the safety of com­muters, but rather “pro­tect­ing rail in­fra­struc­ture and sta­bil­is­ing train ser­vices”. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices, it would seem that SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude from those man­ag­ing our pub­lic trans­port sys­tem not to sim­ply main­tain old le­ga­cies, but to build new ones for the peo­ple. For this is what peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­ment is ul­ti­mately about.

za,Pretoria News,20180705,OPIN­ION: PRO­MOT­ING BRICS CO-OP­ER­A­TION,"IT’S A great plea­sure to meet with so many friends in the beau­ti­ful coun­try of South Africa to dis­cuss the BRICS coun­tries’ ex­pe­ri­ence in gov­er­nance. Jo­han­nes­burg is known as the “City of Gold”, and to­day we are gath­ered here to ex­change ideas, learn from each other, and find the “true gold” of gov­er­nance wis­dom. On be­half of the Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, I would like to ex­tend my con­grat­u­la­tions to the open­ing of the sem­i­nar, and my deep grat­i­tude to our host – the South African Na­tional School of Gov­ern­ment – as well as to other par­ties for their great ef­forts for pre­par­ing for the sem­i­nar. In re­sponse to the call made by BRICS lead­ers to strengthen the ex­change of state gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence, the Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee suc­cess­fully held the first BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance in Quanzhou, Fu­jian Province, the im­por­tant start­ing point of the Mar­itime Silk Road, in Septem­ber last year. Par­tic­i­pants at the sem­i­nar reached the Quanzhou Con­sen­sus of BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, which was in­cluded in the BRICS Lead­ers Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion. The Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion ex­pressly noted the progress made by BRICS coun­tries in the ex­changes and co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing gov­er­nance, film-mak­ing, me­dia, and think-tanks. The Dec­la­ra­tion added: “We ap­pre­ci­ate China’s suc­cess­ful host­ing of the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, and will carry th­ese fruit­ful ini­tia­tives for­ward in the fu­ture.” The BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 held in South Africa is a con­crete step to im­ple­ment the re­sults of BRICS lead­ers’ meet­ing in Xi­a­men, and to honor our agree­ment in Quanzhou. I’m glad that you have all come here as we promised. The theme of this year’s sem­i­nar is “Con­tribut­ing BRICS’ Wis­dom to Global Gov­er­nance in the In­ter­ests of the Peo­ple”. It re­flects the com­mon wish of gov­ern­ment lead­ers, think tank mem­bers, and cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives in the “BRICS Plus” com­mu­nity to pro­mote BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and ben­e­fit the peo­ple of BRICS coun­tries, and will have pro­found im­pact on be­gin­ning the sec­ond “golden decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. I be­lieve your di­a­logues and in-depth ex­changes around the sem­i­nar theme will lead to boun­ti­ful re­sults. The peo­ple are the own­ers of so­ci­ety, and the count­less work­ers rep­re­sent the di­rec­tion of his­tor­i­cal de­vel­op­ment and progress. To truly ben­e­fit the peo­ple, con­tin­u­ously im­prove their lives, and strive for na­tional de­vel­op­ment and progress through their ef­forts – this is the ul­ti­mate yard­stick to mea­sure a party’s gov­ern­ing per­for­mance. The Com­mu­nist Party of China is the rul­ing party of a na­tion that has a pop­u­la­tion of more than 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple. The peo­ple stand for the orig­i­nal as­pi­ra­tion and mis­sion of the party, and the party al­ways stands with the peo­ple, thinks about the peo­ple, and works for the peo­ple. This year marks the 40th an­niver­sary of China’s re­form and open­ing up. In the past 40 years, the Chi­nese econ­omy and so­ci­ety have un­der­gone tremen­dous changes, and the Chi­nese peo­ple’s lives have con­sid­er­ably im­proved, from in­suf­fi­ciency and poverty to af­flu­ence and gen­er­ally mod­er­ate pros­per­ity. Ac­cord­ing to cur­rent UN stan­dards, China has lifted more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, ac­count­ing for more than 70% of the global poverty re­duc­tion in the same pe­riod. This is a remarkable achieve­ment. Af­ter the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress in 2012, the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core has es­tab­lished the peo­ple-cen­tered de­vel­op­ment thought. We take the peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tion for a good life as our goal, im­ple­ment the “peo­ple first” con­cept in all gov­ern­ing work, keep push­ing for­ward so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, and strive for his­toric achieve­ments in the Party’s and na­tion’s un­der­tak­ings. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era has been formed and a new realm in the gov­er­nance of con­tem­po­rary China has been cre­ated. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era is the gen­er­al­i­sa­tion of the gov­ern­ing con­cepts and strate­gies up­held by the CPC and the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. With the peo­ple as its most dis­tinct po­lit­i­cal stance and purest af­fec­tion, it is the key to the de­vel­op­ment and progress of con­tem­po­rary China. Here I want to share with you some of my ob­ser­va­tions. First, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” value ori­en­ta­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has formed deep and nat­u­ral bonds with the peo­ple. He cares about their hap­pi­ness and sadness, speaks for them, and stands up for them. He re­peat­edly em­pha­sized that “win­ning the peo­ple’s sup­port is our big­gest po­lit­i­cal task”, “the peo­ple are whom we rely on”, “en­sur­ing a good life for the peo­ple is the start­ing point and ob­jec­tive of all our work”, and “no one should be left be­hind on the way to mod­er­ate pros­per­ity”. Pres­i­dent Xi made a re­port at the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress in Oc­to­ber last year, in which he men­tioned “the peo­ple” more than 200 times. He has set an ex­am­ple for car­ing for the peo­ple, and has trav­elled nearly all over the coun­try, in­clud­ing all of the ex­tremely poor ar­eas. It’s safe to say that the CPC’s “peo­ple first” con­cept has be­come a pow­er­ful force that keeps all Chi­nese peo­ple united and will help re­alise the Chi­nese Dream. Sec­ond, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” pol­icy di­rec­tion. “All our poli­cies must be aimed to meet the peo­ple’s needs”. The CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core takes “peo­ple cen­trism” as the guid­ance of gov­er­nance, pro­motes the five-sphere in­te­grated plan in a holis­tic way and the four­pronged com­pre­hen­sive strat­egy in a co­or­di­nated way, im­ple­ments new de­vel­op­ment con­cept, deep­ens the sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form, and car­ries out the ru­ral re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion strat­egy, etc. Th­ese sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ing strate­gies are all aimed to im­prove the peo­ple’s wel­fare, boost the mod­erni­sa­tion drive, and push for all-round de­vel­op­ment of the peo­ple and the so­ci­ety. In the past five-plus years, China has im­ple­mented a large num­ber of mea­sures for peo­ple’s wel­fare, lifted over 60 mil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple out of poverty, and re­duced the poverty in­ci­dence from 10.2% to less than 4%. Ed­u­ca­tion de­vel­oped across the board and ed­u­ca­tion in the cen­tral and western re­gions and ru­ral ar­eas was re­mark­ably im­proved; em­ploy­ment im­proved and over 13 mil­lion peo­ple found jobs in cities an­nu­ally; in­come of ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents in­creased faster than eco­nomic growth and the mid­dle-in­come group con­tin­ued to ex­pand; the so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem that cov­ers all ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents was ba­si­cally es­tab­lished, and peo­ple’s health and med­i­cal ser­vice were largely bet­tered, giv­ing them a stronger sense of gain, hap­pi­ness, and se­cu­rity. Third, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” eval­u­a­tion cri­te­rion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping stressed that “the time gives us the test pa­per, we an­swer the pa­per, and the peo­ple grade the pa­per”. The CPC makes great ef­forts to make our re­form and de­vel­op­ment achieve­ments more ac­ces­si­ble to all peo­ple, and takes the peo­ple’s at­ti­tude – their sup­port, ap­proval, sat­is­fac­tion, and en­dorse­ment – as the fun­da­men­tal cri­te­rion for gov­er­nance. Af­ter the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has con­stantly set new records in its “gov­ern­ing per­for­mance sheet”. By 2017, China’s GDP reached RMB82.7 tril­lion, con­tin­u­ing to rank sec­ond in the world and driv­ing global eco­nomic growth. The re­port of the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress pointed out that the prin­ci­pal con­tra­dic­tion fac­ing Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved to “the con­tra­dic­tion be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life”. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment will work hard to adapt to the new change in the prin­ci­pal so­cial con­tra­dic­tion in the new era, launch more projects and mea­sures for im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare, and bet­ter meet the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs in eco­nomic, cul­tural, so­cial, and eco­log­i­cal sec­tors. We will ac­cept the eval­u­a­tion and ex­am­i­na­tion of “peo­ple graders” with full con­fi­dence. Fourth, we should pro­mote the build­ing of a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind with peo­ple at the cen­tre. The world is in a pe­riod of big de­vel­op­ment, big re­form, and big ad­just­ment, with prom­i­nent in­sta­bil­ity and un­cer­tainty. Based on his pro­found in­sight and wise think­ing about hu­man des­tiny, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping put forth China’s as­ser­tion of build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind and forg­ing a new model of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. The orig­i­nal logic for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind is “putting the peo­ple at the cen­tre”. The world is a global vil­lage, where peo­ples of all coun­tries live un­der the same sky and share the same home. We should act as a fam­ily. The dream of the Chi­nese peo­ple is closely con­nected with the dreams of the peo­ples of other coun­tries. China will stay on the path of peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, carry out a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial strat­egy of open­ing up, up­hold jus­tice while pur­su­ing shared in­ter­ests, and pur­sue open, in­no­va­tive, and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment that ben­e­fits ev­ery­one. We will boost cross-cul­tural ex­changes char­ac­terised by har­mony with­out uni­for­mity, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tual learn­ing, cul­ti­vate ecosys­tems based on re­spect for na­ture and green de­vel­op­ment, and con­tinue the ef­forts to safe­guard world peace, con­trib­ute to global de­vel­op­ment, and up­hold in­ter­na­tional or­der. Our call for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind has re­ceived pos­i­tive re­sponses from many coun­tries in the world and has been in­cluded in sev­eral UN res­o­lu­tions. The past decade has seen the BRICS coun­tries mak­ing bril­liant achieve­ments, with more prom­i­nent in­ter­na­tional po­si­tion and in­creas­ing global in­flu­ence. The com­bined GDP of the five BRICS coun­tries has grown by al­most 180%, their to­tal trade vol­ume by 94%, and con­tri­bu­tion to world eco­nomic growth by more than 50%. BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has formed a mul­ti­layer and all-round frame­work cov­er­ing a wide range of ar­eas, in­clud­ing pol­i­tics, econ­omy, fi­nance, trade, so­cial de­vel­op­ment, and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change. It has be­come a co-op­er­a­tion plat­form with global in­flu­ence and a cru­cial mech­a­nism for South-South co-op­er­a­tion, with its sig­nif­i­cance far be­yond the five mem­ber coun­tries. Th­ese achieve­ments are at­trib­uted to our ad­her­ence to the BRICS spirit of open­ness, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion, which en­sures our sound and sus­tained co-op­er­a­tion pace and cease­less co-op­er­a­tion out­comes; to our ex­er­cis­ing the con­cept of global gov­er­nance fea­tur­ing wide con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri­bu­tion, and shared ben­e­fits, sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to proac­tively take part in the re­form and con­struc­tion of the global gov­er­nance sys­tem, and con­stantly con­tribut­ing BRICS wis­dom and strength; and to our value ori­en­ta­tion of safe­guard­ing the peo­ple’s in­ter­ests, pri­or­ity to de­vel­op­ment, per­fec­tion of gov­er­nance, and ef­forts to im­prove the peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare. At the same time, we must see that the world to­day is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes, eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion is en­coun­ter­ing re­sis­tance, trade pro­tec­tion­ism is ris­ing, a cer­tain coun­try is mak­ing ir­re­spon­si­ble poli­cies and tak­ing mea­sures to start trade dis­putes, and the global multi-lat­eral trade sys­tem is harmed se­verely. Due to in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal fac­tors, the eco­nomic growth of BRICS coun­tries is fac­ing new chal­lenges. Some peo­ple take the chance to as­sert that the BRICS coun­tries are los­ing lus­tre and make bear­ish forecast about their co-op­er­a­tion and the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Un­der such cir­cum­stance, it is more im­per­a­tive for us to re­main con­fi­dent and stead­fast, ex­pand the co-op­er­a­tion scope while fo­cus­ing on win-win ar­eas, deepen our part­ner­ships, and con­sol­i­date and ex­pand the BRICS’ cir­cle of friends. Through th­ese ef­forts, we strive to form a new sit­u­a­tion of com­mon progress and de­vel­op­ment, and show the world that the BRICS coun­tries re­main “true gold”. China is a firm sup­porter of and par­tic­i­pant in the BRICS mech­a­nism and takes BRICS co-op­er­a­tion as an im­por­tant part of its diplo­macy. At the ple­nary ses­sion of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit last year, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping solemnly de­clared that “China will launch the BRICS Eco­nomic and Tech­ni­cal Co-op­er­a­tion Plan with RMB500 mil­lion in the first stage to fa­cil­i­tate pol­icy ex­change and prac­ti­cal co-op­er­a­tion in eco­nomic and trade ar­eas. It will also con­trib­ute USD4 mil­lion to the NDB prepa­ra­tion fund to sup­port its busi­ness op­er­a­tions and long-term de­vel­op­ment”. Th­ese mea­sures will gen­er­ate a strong mo­men­tum to kick off the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We be­lieve that the co-op­er­a­tion of BRICS coun­tries will bring more tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits to over 3 bil­lion peo­ple and strongly pro­mote world peace, sta­bil­ity, and pros­per­ity. Think tanks are the brain trust of gov­er­nance. Their ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance and mu­tual learn­ing is of great sig­nif­i­cance for BRICS coun­tries to achieve greater de­vel­op­ment in the fu­ture. To­day, the Sand­ton Convention Cen­tre is full of dis­tin­guished guests, in­clud­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from es­tab­lished think tanks and schol­ars with ad­vanced at­tain­ment from BRICS coun­tries and Africa. We have rea­sons to be­lieve that this is go­ing to be a grand gala of thoughts and ideas. I would like to take this op­por­tu­nity to pro­pose some sug­ges­tions for your ref­er­ence. First, we need to fol­low the prin­ci­ple of equal­ity and mu­tual trust. BRICS coun­tries are in sim­i­lar de­vel­op­ment stages with the same de­vel­op­ment goals even though our na­tional con­di­tions are dif­fer­ent. Although the think tanks here vary in strength and scale, they have re­spec­tive ex­per­tise and share the same goal of boost­ing BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. We will have di­ver­gences dur­ing the ex­change and dis­cus­sion due to dif­fer­ent na­tional con­di­tions, his­tory, and cul­ture, etc. How­ever, as long as we re­spect each other’s de­vel­op­ment path, treat each other equally, seek com­mon ground while shelv­ing dif­fer­ences, en­hance mu­tual trust while dis­pelling doubts, and ac­com­mo­date each other’s con­cerns, we will have a good pre­con­di­tion for dia­logue and con­sul­ta­tion, a solid foun­da­tion for pro­mot­ing prag­matic co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous fields, and a bright prospect for the ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance among BRICS coun­tries. Sec­ond, we need to fo­cus on the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Think tanks are the high­land of ideas and tal­ent with dis­tinc­tive in­tel­li­gence ad­van­tages. Since the sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has be­gun, think tanks should be par­tic­i­pants as well as sug­ges­tion and ser­vice providers. They should sum­marise the law of his­tory, an­a­lyse the gen­eral trend of de­vel­op­ment, study the com­mon dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing BRICS coun­tries, and of­fer sug­ges­tions for the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. To im­ple­ment the fruits of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit, China has ear­marked a spe­cial fund to en­cour­age and sup­port think tanks from dif­fer­ent coun­tries to con­duct re­search on BRICS gov­er­nance, which will be un­der­taken by China For­eign Lan­guages Pub­lish­ing Ad­min­is­tra­tion, one of the hosts of this sem­i­nar. Think tank rep­re­sen­ta­tives here are wel­come to work with the CIPG. Third, we need to en­sure deep and prag­matic dis­cus­sion and ex­change. The sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion will be more vig­or­ous and dy­namic, dur­ing which the BRICS think tanks should fol­low the trend, in­crease in­ter­ac­tions and ex­changes, deepen our friend­ship, and pur­sue com­mon de­vel­op­ment. The suc­cess of this sem­i­nar in South Africa will sig­nal that the BRICS’ gov­er­nance com­mu­ni­ca­tion has be­come a reg­u­lar mech­a­nism within the frame­work of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. It is widely hoped that the sem­i­nar will closely fol­low the BRICS Sum­mit and be held an­nu­ally in the ro­tat­ing presidency, where we will put forth our ideas and sug­ges­tions around the theme of the Sum­mit, and make think tank co-op­er­a­tion a high­light of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We should trans­late the fruits of the Sem­i­nar into ac­tion by com­mu­ni­cat­ing the fruits widely to build con­sen­sus among peo­ple from all walks of life and in­flu­enc­ing gov­ern­ment de­ci­sions pos­i­tively. The Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee will con­tinue to sup­port the ex­change and co-op­er­a­tion among BRICS me­dia to pro­mote the out­comes of the gov­er­nance sem­i­nar and help put them into prac­tice. As a Chi­nese proverb goes, “the fire burns high when ev­ery­body adds wood to it”, and an African proverb goes “one log can’t make a house”. The spark of in­tel­li­gence will only burst into bril­liant light when gath­ered in large quan­tity. We sin­cerely hope that you will can­didly share ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­change views with an open mind, reach more con­sen­suses, and gain more in­sight. Fi­nally, I wish the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 a great suc­cess.",南非

In re­sponse to the call made by BRICS lead­ers to strengthen the ex­change of state gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence, the Pub­lic­ity Depart­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee suc­cess­fully held the first BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance in Quanzhou, Fu­jian Prov­ince, the im­por­tant start­ing point of the Mar­itime Silk Road, in Septem­ber last year. Par­tic­i­pants at the sem­i­nar reached the Quanzhou Con­sen­sus of BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, which was in­cluded in the BRICS Lead­ers Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion. The Xi­a­men Dec­la­ra­tion ex­pressly noted the progress made by BRICS coun­tries in the ex­changes and co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing gov­er­nance, film-making, me­dia, and think­tanks. The Dec­la­ra­tion added: “We ap­pre­ci­ate China’s suc­cess­ful host­ing of the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance, and will carry th­ese fruit­ful ini­tia­tives for­ward in the fu­ture.” The BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 held in South Africa is a con­crete step to im­ple­ment the re­sults of BRICS lead­ers’ meet­ing in Xi­a­men, and to honor our agree­ment in Quanzhou. I’m glad that you have all come here as we promised. The theme of this year’s sem­i­nar is “Con­tribut­ing BRICS’ Wis­dom to Global Gov­er­nance in the In­ter­ests of the Peo­ple”. It re­flects the com­mon wish of gov­ern­ment lead­ers, think tank mem­bers, and cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives in the “BRICS Plus” com­mu­nity to pro­mote BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and ben­e­fit the peo­ple of BRICS coun­tries, and will have pro­found im­pact on be­gin­ning the sec­ond “golden decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. I be­lieve your di­a­logues and in-depth ex­changes around the sem­i­nar theme will lead to boun­ti­ful re­sults. The peo­ple are the own­ers of so­ci­ety, and the count­less work­ers rep­re­sent the di­rec­tion of his­tor­i­cal de­vel­op­ment and progress. To truly ben­e­fit the peo­ple, con­tin­u­ously im­prove their lives, and strive for na­tional de­vel­op­ment and progress through their ef­forts – this is the ul­ti­mate yard­stick to mea­sure a party’s gov­ern­ing per­for­mance. The Com­mu­nist Party of China is the rul­ing party of a na­tion that has a pop­u­la­tion of more than 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple. The peo­ple stand for the orig­i­nal as­pi­ra­tion and mis­sion of the party, and the party al­ways stands with the peo­ple, thinks about the peo­ple, and works for the peo­ple. This year marks the 40th an­niver­sary of China’s re­form and open­ing up. In the past 40 years, the Chi­nese econ­omy and so­ci­ety have un­der­gone tremen­dous changes, and the Chi­nese peo­ple’s lives have con­sid­er­ably im­proved, from in­suf­fi­ciency and poverty to af­flu­ence and gen­er­ally mod­er­ate pros­per­ity. Ac­cord­ing to cur­rent UN stan­dards, China has lifted more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, ac­count­ing for more than 70% of the global poverty re­duc­tion in the same pe­riod. This is a re­mark­able achieve­ment. After the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress in 2012, the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core has estab­lished the peo­ple-cen­tered de­vel­op­ment thought. We take the peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tion for a good life as our goal, im­ple­ment the “peo­ple first” con­cept in all gov­ern­ing work, keep push­ing for­ward so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, and strive for his­toric achieve­ments in the Party’s and na­tion’s un­der­tak­ings. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era has been formed and a new realm in the gov­er­nance of con­tem­po­rary China has been cre­ated. The Xi Jin­ping Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era is the gen­er­al­i­sa­tion of the gov­ern­ing con­cepts and strate­gies up­held by the CPC and the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. With the peo­ple as its most dis­tinct po­lit­i­cal stance and purest af­fec­tion, it is the key to the de­vel­op­ment and progress of con­tem­po­rary China. Here I want to share with you some of my ob­ser­va­tions. First, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” value ori­en­ta­tion. President Xi Jin­ping has formed deep and nat­u­ral bonds with the peo­ple. He cares about their happiness and sad­ness, speaks for them, and stands up for them. He re­peat­edly em­pha­sized that “win­ning the peo­ple’s sup­port is our big­gest po­lit­i­cal task”, “the peo­ple are whom we rely on”, “en­sur­ing a good life for the peo­ple is the start­ing point and ob­jec­tive of all our work”, and “no one should be left be­hind on the way to mod­er­ate pros­per­ity”. President Xi made a re­port at the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress in Oc­to­ber last year, in which he men­tioned “the peo­ple” more than 200 times. He has set an ex­am­ple for car­ing for the peo­ple, and has trav­elled nearly all over the coun­try, in­clud­ing all of the ex­tremely poor ar­eas. It’s safe to say that the CPC’s “peo­ple first” con­cept has be­come a pow­er­ful force that keeps all Chi­nese peo­ple united and will help re­alise the Chi­nese Dream. Sec­ond, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” pol­icy di­rec­tion. “All our poli­cies must be aimed to meet the peo­ple’s needs”. The CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Xi Jin­ping at the core takes “peo­ple cen­trism” as the guid­ance of gov­er­nance, pro­motes the five­sphere in­te­grated plan in a holis­tic way and the four-pronged com­pre­hen­sive strat­egy in a co­or­di­nated way, im­ple­ments new de­vel­op­ment con­cept, deepens the sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form, and car­ries out the ru­ral revitalisation strat­egy, etc. Th­ese sub­stan­tial gov­ern­ing strate­gies are all aimed to im­prove the peo­ple’s wel­fare, boost the mod­erni­sa­tion drive, and push for all-round de­vel­op­ment of the peo­ple and the so­ci­ety. In the past five-plus years, China has im­ple­mented a large num­ber of mea­sures for peo­ple’s wel­fare, lifted over 60 mil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple out of poverty, and re­duced the poverty in­ci­dence from 10.2% to less than 4%. Ed­u­ca­tion de­vel­oped across the board and ed­u­ca­tion in the cen­tral and western re­gions and ru­ral ar­eas was re­mark­ably im­proved; em­ploy­ment im­proved and over 13 mil­lion peo­ple found jobs in cities an­nu­ally; in­come of ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents in­creased faster than eco­nomic growth and the mid­dle-in­come group con­tin­ued to ex­pand; the so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem that cov­ers all ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents was ba­si­cally estab­lished, and peo­ple’s health and med­i­cal ser­vice were largely bet­tered, giv­ing them a stronger sense of gain, happiness, and se­cu­rity. Third, we should ad­here to “peo­ple-cen­tered” eval­u­a­tion cri­te­rion. President Xi Jin­ping stressed that “the time gives us the test pa­per, we an­swer the pa­per, and the peo­ple grade the pa­per”. The CPC makes great ef­forts to make our re­form and de­vel­op­ment achieve­ments more ac­ces­si­ble to all peo­ple, and takes the peo­ple’s at­ti­tude – their sup­port, ap­proval, sat­is­fac­tion, and en­dorse­ment – as the fun­da­men­tal cri­te­rion for gov­er­nance. After the 18th CPC Na­tional Congress, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has con­stantly set new records in its “gov­ern­ing per­for­mance sheet”. By 2017, China’s GDP reached RMB82.7 tril­lion, con­tin­u­ing to rank sec­ond in the world and driv­ing global eco­nomic growth. The re­port of the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress pointed out that the prin­ci­pal con­tra­dic­tion fac­ing Chi­nese so­ci­ety has evolved to “the con­tra­dic­tion be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs for a bet­ter life”. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment will work hard to adapt to the new change in the prin­ci­pal so­cial con­tra­dic­tion in the new era, launch more projects and mea­sures for im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare, and bet­ter meet the peo­ple’s ever-grow­ing needs in eco­nomic, cul­tural, so­cial, and eco­log­i­cal sec­tors. We will ac­cept the eval­u­a­tion and ex­am­i­na­tion of “peo­ple graders” with full con­fi­dence. Fourth, we should pro­mote the build­ing of a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind with peo­ple at the cen­tre. The world is in a pe­riod of big de­vel­op­ment, big re­form, and big ad­just­ment, with prom­i­nent in­sta­bil­ity and un­cer­tainty. Based on his pro­found in­sight and wise think­ing about hu­man des­tiny, President Xi Jin­ping put forth China’s as­ser­tion of build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind and forg­ing a new model of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. The orig­i­nal logic for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind is “putting the peo­ple at the cen­tre”. The world is a global vil­lage, where peo­ples of all coun­tries live un­der the same sky and share the same home. We should act as a fam­ily. The dream of the Chi­nese peo­ple is closely con­nected with the dreams of the peo­ples of other coun­tries. China will stay on the path of peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, carry out a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial strat­egy of open­ing up, up­hold jus­tice while pur­su­ing shared in­ter­ests, and pur­sue open, in­no­va­tive, and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment that benefits ev­ery­one. We will boost cross-cul­tural ex­changes char­ac­terised by har­mony with­out uni­for­mity, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tual learn­ing, cul­ti­vate ecosys­tems based on re­spect for na­ture and green de­vel­op­ment, and con­tinue the ef­forts to safe­guard world peace, con­trib­ute to global de­vel­op­ment, and up­hold in­ter­na­tional or­der. Our call for build­ing a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind has re­ceived pos­i­tive re­sponses from many coun­tries in the world and has been in­cluded in sev­eral UN res­o­lu­tions. The past decade has seen the BRICS coun­tries making bril­liant achieve­ments, with more prom­i­nent in­ter­na­tional po­si­tion and in­creas­ing global in­flu­ence. The com­bined GDP of the five BRICS coun­tries has grown by al­most 180%, their to­tal trade vol­ume by 94%, and con­tri­bu­tion to world eco­nomic growth by more than 50%. BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has formed a multi-layer and all-round frame­work cov­er­ing a wide range of ar­eas, in­clud­ing pol­i­tics, econ­omy, fi­nance, trade, so­cial de­vel­op­ment, and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change. It has be­come a co-op­er­a­tion plat­form with global in­flu­ence and a cru­cial mech­a­nism for SouthSouth co-op­er­a­tion, with its sig­nif­i­cance far beyond the five mem­ber coun­tries. Th­ese achieve­ments are at­trib­uted to our ad­her­ence to the BRICS spirit of open­ness, in­clu­sive­ness, and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion, which en­sures our sound and sus­tained co-op­er­a­tion pace and cease­less co-op­er­a­tion out­comes; to our ex­er­cis­ing the con­cept of global gov­er­nance fea­tur­ing wide con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri­bu­tion, and shared benefits, supporting de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to proac­tively take part in the re­form and construction of the global gov­er­nance sys­tem, and con­stantly con­tribut­ing BRICS wis­dom and strength; and to our value ori­en­ta­tion of safe­guard­ing the peo­ple’s in­ter­ests, pri­or­ity to de­vel­op­ment, per­fec­tion of gov­er­nance, and ef­forts to im­prove the peo­ple’s liveli­hood and wel­fare. At the same time, we must see that the world to­day is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes, eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion is en­coun­ter­ing resistance, trade pro­tec­tion­ism is ris­ing, a cer­tain coun­try is making ir­re­spon­si­ble poli­cies and tak­ing mea­sures to start trade dis­putes, and the global multi-lat­eral trade sys­tem is harmed se­verely. Due to in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal fac­tors, the eco­nomic growth of BRICS coun­tries is fac­ing new chal­lenges. Some peo­ple take the chance to as­sert that the BRICS coun­tries are los­ing lus­tre and make a bear­ish fore­cast about their co-op­er­a­tion and the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Un­der such cir­cum­stance, it is more im­per­a­tive for us to re­main con­fi­dent and stead­fast, ex­pand the co-op­er­a­tion scope while fo­cus­ing on win-win ar­eas, deepen our part­ner­ships, and con­sol­i­date and ex­pand the BRICS’ cir­cle of friends. Through th­ese ef­forts, we strive to form a new si­t­u­a­tion of com­mon progress and de­vel­op­ment, and show the world that the BRICS coun­tries re­main “true gold”. China is a firm sup­porter of and par­tic­i­pant in the BRICS mech­a­nism and takes BRICS co-op­er­a­tion as an im­por­tant part of its diplo­macy. At the ple­nary ses­sion of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit last year, Chi­nese President Xi Jin­ping solemnly de­clared that “China will launch the BRICS Eco­nomic and Tech­ni­cal Co-op­er­a­tion Plan with RMB500 mil­lion in the first stage to fa­cil­i­tate pol­icy ex­change and prac­ti­cal co-op­er­a­tion in eco­nomic and trade ar­eas. It will also con­trib­ute USD4 mil­lion to the NDB prepa­ra­tion fund to sup­port its busi­ness op­er­a­tions and long-term de­vel­op­ment”. Th­ese mea­sures will gen­er­ate a strong mo­men­tum to kick off the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We be­lieve that the co-op­er­a­tion of BRICS coun­tries will bring more tan­gi­ble benefits to over 3 bil­lion peo­ple and strongly pro­mote world peace, sta­bil­ity, and pros­per­ity. Think tanks are the brain trust of gov­er­nance. Their ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance and mu­tual learn­ing is of great sig­nif­i­cance for BRICS coun­tries to achieve greater de­vel­op­ment in the fu­ture. To­day, the Sand­ton Con­ven­tion Cen­tre is full of dis­tin­guished guests, in­clud­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from estab­lished think tanks and schol­ars with ad­vanced at­tain­ment from BRICS coun­tries and Africa. We have rea­sons to be­lieve that this is go­ing to be a grand gala of thoughts and ideas. I would like to take this op­por­tu­nity to pro­pose some sug­ges­tions for your ref­er­ence. First, we need to fol­low the prin­ci­ple of equal­ity and mu­tual trust. BRICS coun­tries are in sim­i­lar de­vel­op­ment stages with the same de­vel­op­ment goals even though our na­tional con­di­tions are dif­fer­ent. Although the think tanks here vary in strength and scale, they have re­spec­tive ex­per­tise and share the same goal of boost­ing BRICS co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. We will have di­ver­gences dur­ing the ex­change and dis­cus­sion due to dif­fer­ent na­tional con­di­tions, his­tory, and cul­ture, etc. How­ever, as long as we re­spect each other’s de­vel­op­ment path, treat each other equally, seek com­mon ground while shelv­ing dif­fer­ences, en­hance mu­tual trust while dis­pelling doubts, and ac­com­mo­date each other’s con­cerns, we will have a good pre­con­di­tion for dialogue and con­sul­ta­tion, a solid foun­da­tion for pro­mot­ing prag­matic co-op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous fields, and a bright prospect for the ex­change and dis­cus­sion of gov­er­nance among BRICS coun­tries. Sec­ond, we need to fo­cus on the sec­ond “Golden Decade”. Think tanks are the high­land of ideas and tal­ent with dis­tinc­tive in­tel­li­gence ad­van­tages. Since the sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion has be­gun, think tanks should be par­tic­i­pants as well as sug­ges­tion and ser­vice providers. They should sum­marise the law of his­tory, an­a­lyse the gen­eral trend of de­vel­op­ment, study the com­mon dif­fi­cul­ties fac­ing BRICS coun­tries, and of­fer sug­ges­tions for the sec­ond “Golden Decade” of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. To im­ple­ment the fruits of the BRICS Xi­a­men Sum­mit, China has ear­marked a spe­cial fund to en­cour­age and sup­port think tanks from dif­fer­ent coun­tries to con­duct re­search on BRICS gov­er­nance, which will be un­der­taken by China For­eign Lan­guages Pub­lish­ing Ad­min­is­tra­tion, one of the hosts of this sem­i­nar. Think tank rep­re­sen­ta­tives here are wel­come to work with the CIPG. Third, we need to ensure deep and prag­matic dis­cus­sion and ex­change. The sec­ond decade of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion will be more vig­or­ous and dy­namic, dur­ing which the BRICS think tanks should fol­low the trend, in­crease in­ter­ac­tions and ex­changes, deepen our friend­ship, and pur­sue com­mon de­vel­op­ment. The suc­cess of this sem­i­nar in South Africa will sig­nal that the BRICS’ gov­er­nance com­mu­ni­ca­tion has be­come a reg­u­lar mech­a­nism within the frame­work of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. It is widely hoped that the sem­i­nar will closely fol­low the BRICS Sum­mit and be held an­nu­ally in the ro­tat­ing pres­i­dency, where we will put forth our ideas and sug­ges­tions around the theme of the Sum­mit, and make think tank co-op­er­a­tion a high­light of BRICS co-op­er­a­tion. We should trans­late the fruits of the Sem­i­nar into ac­tion by com­mu­ni­cat­ing the fruits widely to build con­sen­sus among peo­ple from all walks of life and in­flu­enc­ing gov­ern­ment de­ci­sions pos­i­tively. The Pub­lic­ity Depart­ment of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee will con­tinue to sup­port the ex­change and co-op­er­a­tion among BRICS me­dia to pro­mote the out­comes of the gov­er­nance sem­i­nar and help put them into prac­tice. As a Chi­nese proverb goes, “the fire burns high when ev­ery­body adds wood to it”, and an African proverb goes “one log can’t make a house”. The spark of in­tel­li­gence will only burst into bril­liant light when gath­ered in large quan­tity. We sin­cerely hope that you will can­didly share ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­change views with an open mind, reach more con­sen­suses, and gain more in­sight. Fi­nally, I wish the BRICS Sem­i­nar on Gov­er­nance 2018 a great suc­cess.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20181123,LES­SONS FOR WEST IN CURB­ING TER­ROR­ISM,"RE­CENTLY some Western politi­cians and me­dia, in dis­re­gard of the facts, have launched crit­i­cism that the vo­ca­tional tech­ni­cal train­ing pro­grammes car­ried out by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment in Xin­jiang are “eth­nic seg­re­ga­tion”, “re­li­gious per­se­cu­tion”, “re-ed­u­ca­tion camps”, and “vi­o­la­tions against hu­man rights”. This is a bare-faced lie. Xin­jiang is an in­alien­able part of China. The mi­nor­ity eth­nic pop­u­la­tion en­joy full re­li­gious free­dom as ev­i­denced by 24400 mosques, more than dou­ble the num­ber of mosques in the US (around 2000), UK (1750), Ger­many (3000) and France (2500). Over the past sev­eral years, as­sisted by the in­dul­gence and provo­ca­tion by some anti-China forces, some eth­nic sep­a­ratists, re­li­gious ex­trem­ists, and ter­ror­ists within and out­side China have car­ried out ter­ror­ist at­tacks in­volv­ing bomb­ings, as­sas­si­na­tions, poi­son­ing, ar­son at­tacks, and pub­lic ri­ots, tak­ing the lives of nu­mer­ous in­no­cent mem­bers of the pub­lic, in­clud­ing hun­dreds of po­lice. This has gravely threat­ened the sta­bil­ity and har­mony of the so­ci­ety, and tram­pled on the ba­sic hu­man rights of all eth­nic groups in Xin­jiang. In the face of these atroc­i­ties, some peo­ple still liv­ing with the Cold War men­tal­ity in the West have failed to ex­press due con­dem­na­tion. Some have en­cour­aged these hor­ri­ble acts. This is dou­ble stan­dards by the West. We be­lieve any­one who is fa­mil­iar with na­tional laws, has good pro­fes­sional knowl­edge and ex­per­tise, and has a de­cent job and fam­ily will not eas­ily fall for ter­ror­ism or re­li­gious ex­trem­ism. The root cause of ter­ror­ism is poverty. The key to elim­i­nat­ing ter­ror­ism is to ac­cel­er­ate devel­op­ment in Xin­jiang, so as to pro­vide ev­ery­one, the youth in par­tic­u­lar, de­cent work, in­come and fam­ily life. This is fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent from the Western ap­proach of fight­ing vi­o­lence with vi­o­lence to up­root ter­ror­ism. On the one hand, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to fight­ing fiercely against ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lent crimes ac­cord­ing to law, ef­fec­tively pro­tect­ing the ba­sic hu­man rights of all cit­i­zens, firmly up­hold­ing so­cial sta­bil­ity in Xin­jiang, and pro­vid­ing in­ten­sive pol­icy sup­port and cre­at­ing con­di­tions to sup­port fast devel­op­ment in the re­gion. On the other hand, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has been ac­tively cre­at­ing a new model of counter-ter­ror­ism mainly fo­cused on preven­tion. We have es­tab­lished vo­ca­tional tech­ni­cal train­ing schools to of­fer free train­ing pro­grammes for lo­cal youths, in­clud­ing those who have com­mit­ted mi­nor of­fences but have been ex­empted from crim­i­nal pun­ish­ment. We have or­gan­ised pro­grammes for them to learn Man­darin Chi­nese –the na­tional com­mu­ni­ca­tion lan­guage of China, and the laws of the coun­try, in­clud­ing the con­sti­tu­tion. To sup­port them im­prov­ing their em­ploy­a­bil­ity, we have of­fered train­ing in gar­ment man­u­fac­tur­ing, food pro­cess­ing, elec­tronic as­sem­bly, print­ing and pub­lish­ing, and e-com­merce. The goal is to sup­port them build­ing ba­sic skills and greater knowl­edge, to get bet­ter jobs and to make a bet­ter liv­ing, as an al­ter­na­tive to par­tic­i­pat­ing in ter­ror­ist crimes.",南非
za,The Star Early Edition,20150213,Gold de­mand con­tin­ues to fall,"GOLD de­mand fell for a third year on a slump in pur­chases from China, cost­ing the coun­try its place as the world’s big­gest buyer. Global de­mand slid 4 per­cent to a five-year low of 3 923.7 met­ric tons in 2014, the World Gold Coun­cil said in a re­port yes­ter­day. In China, pur­chases of bars and coins for in­vest­ment dropped by 50 per­cent and jew­ellery buy­ing re­treated from a record, ac­cord­ing to the Lon­don-based group. The strength­en­ing dollar and prospects for higher US in­ter­est rates have curbed gold’s ap­peal as a pro­tec­tion of wealth, lead­ing to two years of fall­ing prices. While the metal has re­bounded over the past three months, it is still within 10 per­cent of a four-year low. “2014 was a year of sta­bil­i­sa­tion,” Alis­tair He­witt, the head of mar­ket in­tel­li­gence at the coun­cil, said. “We saw bar and coin de­mand decline sub­stan­tially both in In­dia and China.” Gold rose 3.2 per­cent to $1 221.82 (R14 364) an ounce in Lon­don this year. In­dia took China’s spot as big­gest buyer of the metal, re­claim­ing the po­si­tion it last held in 2012, af­ter jew­ellery de­mand jumped to the high­est level since at least 1995. In­dia’s to­tal de­mand in 2014 was 842.7 tons, 14 per­cent lower on year, while China’s sank 38 per­cent to 813.6 tons, the re­port showed. Pur­chases of neck­laces, bracelets and ear­rings by In­dian shop­pers rose 8 per­cent even amid im­port re­stric­tions, while Chi­nese con­sumers bought 33 per­cent less. Com­bined bar and coin in­vest­ment was down 50 per­cent in both coun­tries. It was too close to call which coun­try be­tween In­dia and China would be the big­gest buyer this year, with an­nual de­mand in both coun­tries fore­cast at 900 to 1 000 tons, He­witt said. For the fourth quar­ter, global de­mand to­talled 987.5 tons, up about 6 per­cent from a year ear­lier. PR So­ma­sun­daram, the coun­cil’s man­ag­ing direc­tor for In­dia, said on Wed­nes­day that the coun­try might re­main the top con­sumer in 2015 be­cause of eco­nomic ex­pan­sion. “Eco­nomic growth is good. As more peo­ple come to the sav­ings fold and out of the poverty line, gold will con­tinue to mean some­thing to them.” In­vestors in ex­change­traded prod­ucts backed by gold con­tin­ued to re­duce their hold­ings. Sales to­talled 164.4 tons in 2014 as ex­change-traded funds ap­proached a five-year low, data com­piled by Bloomberg show. The drop in hold­ings was 869.1 tons in 2013. Cen­tral banks added the metal to re­serves for a fifth con­sec­u­tive year, buy­ing 477.2 tons, 17 per­cent more than in 2013 and the sec­ond-high­est amount in the past 50 years. De­mand from the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try fell al­most 5 per­cent to 389 tons last year, the low­est level since 2003. – Bloomberg",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20191105,Chi­nese im­port expo sets to in­ject fresh mo­men­tum into open world econ­omy,"As China’s key move to ac­tively open its mar­ket, the sec­ond China In­ter­na­tional Im­port Expo (CIIE) is set to in­ject fresh mo­men­tum into an open world econ­omy. This year’s CIIE sched­uled from Nov. 5 to 10 sees a ris­ing num­ber of par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies, new prod­ucts and cut­ting-edge tech­nolo­gies as well as the ex­pand­ing space for ex­hi­bi­tions. Of­fi­cial data show the im­port-themed fair this year will at­tract more than 250 of the world’s top 500 or lead­ing com­pa­nies, show­ing the fair’s grow­ing in­flu­ence. The ex­hi­bi­tion area will rise to 360,000 square me­ters, up by 60,000 square me­ters from last year. “Set up by China and shared by the world, the CIIE in­jects vi­tal­ity and con­fi­dence into the build­ing of an open world econ­omy,” China’s Com­merce Minister Zhong Shan said. WIDER OPEN­ING-UP Mo­ham­mad Nu­rus Safa, a Bangladeshi busi­ness­man, will soon have his sec­ond group of com­modi­ties shipped to Shang­hai for the CIIE. “This year we will bring unique lo­cal em­broi­dery prod­ucts to the expo, so that more Bangladeshi peo­ple can share devel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties brought by the ‘China ex­press train’,” said Safa, founder of Dada Bangla Lim­ited. Safa’s com­pany is one of the 3,000 en­ter­prises from about 150 coun­tries and re­gions hav­ing signed up for this year’s expo. Re­gard­ing the CIIE as a great plat­form to reach cus­tomers of ev­ery de­scrip­tion, Fabrice Me­gar­bane, CEO of L’Oreal China, said the com­pany will ex­hibit 11 brands in the new high-end sec­tion of the con­sumer goods ex­hi­bi­tion area. “In ad­di­tion to the op­por­tu­ni­ties brought by the im­port expo it­self, China’s con­stantly en­hanced busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment has also impressed us,” said Anna E, pub­lic af­fairs di­rec­tor of Mars China. China’s new open­ing-up poli­cies this year have pro­vided greater im­pe­tus for for­eign com­pa­nies to in­crease in­vest­ment in the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy. On July 30, China put into force re­vised neg­a­tive lists for for­eign in­vest­ment mar­ket ac­cess, in­tro­duc­ing greater open­ing-up in such sec­tors as ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing and min­ing, and al­low­ing for­eign in­vestors to run ma­jor­ity-share-con­trol­ling or wholly-owned busi­nesses in more sec­tors. In Au­gust, China an­nounced a mas­ter plan for new pi­lot free trade zones (FTZs) in six pro­vin­cial-level re­gions, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of its pi­lot FTZs to 18. The FTZs will test new styles of for­eign in­vest­ment man­age­ment, trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion and trans­for­ma­tion of gov­ern­ment func­tions to bet­ter in­te­grate the econ­omy with in­ter­na­tional prac­tices. The im­port expo not only boosts the im­port of goods and ser­vices, but also pro­motes the up­grad­ing of for­eign in­vest­ment through the pull of trade and the mar­ket, said Min Shilin, ex­ec­u­tive deputy di­rec­tor of the Ad­min­is­tra­tion Com­mit­tee of Shang­hai Hongqiao Cen­tral Busi­ness District. A bonded lo­gis­tics cen­ter in the Hongqiao CBD was launched in Septem­ber to of­fer on­estop trad­ing ser­vices to sup­port the CIIE. MORE FRUIT­FUL ACHIEVE­MENTS The first im­port expo in Shang­hai last Novem­ber ac­cel­er­ated the en­try of for­eign brands into more in­land re­gions in China, es­pe­cially the coun­try’s third- to fifth-tier towns and cities, high­light­ing the po­ten­tial of the huge Chi­nese mar­ket. At the first CIIE, Safa’s com­pany ex­hib­ited a va­ri­ety of lo­cal jute hand­i­crafts, such as car­pets, bas­kets and bags. The prod­ucts, many of which were made by im­pov­er­ished women in Bangladesh, at­tracted at­ten­tion of vis­i­tors and buy­ers. “The CIIE op­por­tu­ni­ties are con­tribut­ing to global poverty re­duc­tion ef­forts,” Safa said. Thanks to the first CIIE, th­ese Bangladeshi hand­i­crafts are now sold at a high-end de­part­ment store in Shang­hai. Three months af­ter the first CIIE, milk prod­ucts of a New Zealand brand show­cased at the expo ap­peared in a county su­per­mar­ket in northwest China’s Ningxia Hui Au­tonomous Re­gion. In a bonded trad­ing cen­ter in south­west­ern Chongqing Mu­nic­i­pal­ity, for­eign com­modi­ties such as Rus­sian ice cream, Ge­or­gian wine and Kenyan dec­o­ra­tions have be­come a hit among lo­cal con­sumers. The first CIIE has drawn more than 3,600 en­ter­prises from 172 coun­tries, re­gions and in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions, at­tract­ing more than 400,000 do­mes­tic and overseas pur­chasers. Deals for in­tended one-year pur­chases of goods and ser­vices worth a to­tal of 57.83 bil­lion U.S. dol­lars were reached in the six-day event. Many of the goods were im­ported via the China-Europe freight rail ser­vice net­work, which has pushed for­ward China’s open­ing-up and boosted trade co­op­er­a­tion with overseas mar­kets. The fa­cil­i­tated im­port poli­cies, such as re­duced im­port tar­iffs and sim­pli­fied cus­toms clear­ance process, also make for­eign brands reach the Chi­nese mar­ket faster. A batch of fresh milk leav­ing a New Zealand farm on Mon­day can reach Chi­nese din­ner ta­bles as soon as Wednesday. Food traders are pre­par­ing to im­port more fresh and frozen food to the Chi­nese con­sumers. “The first CIIE re­in­forced our con­fi­dence in China’s busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment poli­cies and en­abled us to see the coun­try’s con­tin­u­ously grow­ing do­mes­tic mar­ket de­mand,” said Me­gar­bane. “The sec­ond CIIE will build a plat­form for the launch and dis­play of new prod­ucts and tech­nolo­gies. It demon­strates China’s de­ter­mi­na­tion and con­fi­dence to im­ple­ment free trade, and will fur­ther im­prove peo­ple’s liv­ing qual­ity and pro­mote do­mes­tic con­sump­tion,” said Sun Cheng­hai, vice di­rec­tor of CIIE Bu­reau.",南非
za,Sowetan,20161021,EM­POW­ER­ING GIRLS WILL BRING IN BIL­LIONS UN,"LON­DON – De­vel­op­ing economies stand to win an ex­tra $21-bil­lion (R291-bil­lion) if they im­prove girls’ health and sex ed­u­ca­tion, the United Na­tions Pop­u­la­tion Fund (UNFPA) said yes­ter­day. Girls in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are less likely than boys to com­plete school­ing be­cause of forced mar­riage, child labour and fe­male gen­i­tal mu­ti­la­tion, risk­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties pre­sented by their largely young pop­u­la­tions, said the study, launched in Lon­don. “Over the next 15 years alone, de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to­gether stand to gain or for­feit at least $21-bil­lion, de­pend­ing on whether or not they in­vest in the well­be­ing, ed­u­ca­tion and in­de­pen­dence of their 10-year-old girls today,” it said. “When the right poli­cies and in­sti­tu­tions are in place to build young peo­ple’s hu­man cap­i­tal, a de­vel­op­ing coun­try can see dra­matic eco­nomic growth... lead­ing to a de­mo­graphic div­i­dend, a unique op­por­tu­nity for eco­nomic progress and poverty re­duc­tion.” Girls are cur­rently less likely to be en­rolled in sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion in Arab coun­tries and most of Africa – home to 70% of the world’s 10year-olds today. Six­teen mil­lion girls aged be­tween six and 11 will never start school – twice the num­ber of boys. “For 10-year-old girls, a po­ten­tial tripling of their life­time in­come is at stake. For the so­ci­eties the girls are a part of, the re­duc­tion of poverty is at stake,” said the re­port. Many girls fail to fin­ish their ed­u­ca­tion after get­ting mar­ried in early ado­les­cence, and the UNFPA urged coun­tries to im­pose a min­i­mum age of mar­riage of 18. Ev­ery day, an es­ti­mated 47 700 girls get mar­ried be­fore that age, they said. Com­pre­hen­sive sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion pro­grammes should also be ex­panded to 10-yearold girls in or­der to pro­tect their health and take con­trol of their own fer­til­ity, it ad­vised. “Many girls may not have a safe fo­rum in which to ask ques­tions about th­ese top­ics, which in many com­mu­ni­ties are still con­sid­ered taboo,” it said. “Ac­cess to con­tra­cep­tives for ado­les­cents and women of child-bear­ing age is cru­cial.” The study gave In­dia and China as ex­am­ples of the progress pos­si­ble if de­vel­op­ing coun­tries har­nessed their youth­ful pop­u­la­tions. –",南非
za,Cape Argus,20180320,Big push to build a ‘Beau­ti­ful China’,"WHEN China’s na­tional leg­is­la­ture ap­proved the form­ing of a Min­istry of Eco­log­i­cal En­vi­ron­ment, Wen Juan could not help ap­plaud­ing. The new min­istry will in­cor­po­rate the old en­vi­ron­ment min­istry with rel­e­vant func­tions seg­mented in other min­istries, en­abling the gov­ern­ment to ac­cel­er­ate en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and eco­log­i­cal con­ser­va­tion in a more com­pre­hen­sive way. It was part of a mas­sive cabi­net re­struc­tur­ing plan adopted at the on­go­ing ses­sion of the 13th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress (NPC), with the min­istry’s chief Li Gan­jie ap­pointed yes­ter­day. “Form­ing the min­istry shows the gov­ern­ment’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to in­ten­sify en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion,” said Wen, an NPC deputy, adding she was glad to see such progress. Wen is deputy head of the en­vi­ron­ment pro­tec­tion re­search in­sti­tu­tion of Tian­jin Mu­nic­i­pal­ity. Years of in­ves­ti­ga­tion and ap­peal by Wen and her col­leagues have trig­gered gov­ern­ment ac­tions against ves­sel emis­sion pol­lu­tion, a prob­lem long ig­nored in China. Wen and her col­leagues found that most ocean-go­ing ves­sels to Tian­jin Port and other Chi­nese ports used high-sul­fur fuel, caus­ing se­ri­ous air pol­lu­tion. They raised sug­ges­tions re­gard­ing ves­sel ex­haust con­trol, which were sub­mit­ted to the NPC in March 2015 for na­tional law­mak­ers to de­lib­er­ate. Five months later, the NPC Stand­ing Com­mit­tee passed an amend­ment to the Air Pol­lu­tion Con­trol Law, which stip­u­lated that ships en­ter­ing a con­trol area for pol­lu­tant dis­charge must con­form to emis­sion re­quire­ments. In De­cem­ber 2015, the Min­istry of Trans­port is­sued an ac­tion plan to con­trol ves­sel ex­haust in wa­ters of the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta and the area en­cir­cling the Bo­hai Sea where Tian­jin Port lies. Wen said she was greatly en­cour­aged by the quick re­sponse of the leg­is­la­ture and the gov­ern­ment, and the de­ter­mi­na­tion to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment. Last year the av­er­age den­sity of PM2.5, a ma­jor index of air pol­lu­tion, in Tian­jin de­clined to 62 mi­cro­grams a cu­bic me­ter, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data. Pol­lu­tion con­trol has been iden­ti­fied as one of the coun­try’s “crit­i­cal bat­tles” in the next two years, along with fi­nan­cial risk pre­ven­tion and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. Chi­nese lead­ers have re­peat­edly stressed the gov­ern­ment must take ac­tion to build a “Beau­ti­ful China, where the skies are blue, the land is green and the wa­ters are clear”. The form­ing of the Min­istry of Eco­log­i­cal En­vi­ron­ment is con­sid­ered the lat­est move to have such a goal ful­filled. The new min­istry will bet­ter carry out du­ties such as en­vi­ron­ment mon­i­tor­ing and law en­force­ment, Li Gan­jie said on the side­lines of the NPC ses­sion on Satur­day. Other mea­sures taken in­clude wide-rang­ing in­spec­tions and se­vere pun­ish­ment in pol­lu­tion cases. Ac­cord­ing to Li, around 20000 peo­ple, in­clud­ing high-rank­ing of­fi­cials, have been held ac­count­able for en­vi­ron­ment-re­lated mis­con­duct since four rounds of cen­tral author­ity in­spec­tions were launched over the past two years. Apart from ad­dress­ing air pol­lu­tion, China has been strength­en­ing ef­forts to fight wa­ter and soil pol­lu­tion.

za,Daily News,20181107,CAPE TRANS­PORT IN­VEST­MENT IS IM­PER­A­TIVE,"RE­CENTLY China opened the world’s long­est sea bridge. Of­fi­cially called the Hong Kong-Ma­cau-Zhuhai bridge, the struc­ture, which cost $20 bil­lion (about R285bn), is about 55km long and while for the most part it crosses wa­ter, it also has a 7km tun­nel. The con­struc­tion of the bridge took eight years, and now con­nects main­land China (Zhuhai) to the semi­au­tonomous re­gions of Hong Kong and Ma­cau. Be­fore the bridge was built, it took three hours to travel between Zhuhai and Hong Kong. Now it takes 30 min­utes. By build­ing this bridge it is sug­gested that Bei­jing seeks to en­sure that the Greater Bay Area be­comes a tech­no­log­i­cal and in­no­va­tion-fo­cused zone. Au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing sug­gest that by 2030, nearly 30 000 ve­hi­cles and nearly 130 000 pas­sen­ger trips would utilise the bridge daily. Most im­por­tantly, it in­te­grates the three ter­ri­to­ries and gives life to the “One China” pol­icy. China, a de­vel­op­ing coun­try once plagued with op­pres­sion, in­equal­ity, dis­ease, famine and poverty, has now emerged as a de­vel­oped na­tion. As we en­ter a new phase of glob­al­i­sa­tion and with the on­set of the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, at the 13th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­gress in 2017, in­tro­duced the Xi Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era. Meet­ing with 13 African heads of state on the side­lines of his first BRICS Sum­mit in SA in 2013, Xi em­pha­sised the need for in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture on the African con­ti­nent. This is not far from the em­pha­sis placed on the in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture by the AU’s Agenda 2063. By us­ing it­self as a roadmap, China, Xi pointed out, wished to en­sure that African peo­ple them­selves were in­ter­con­nected and en­abled to con­nect with each other. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices … SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude of peo­ple­cen­tred de­vel­op­ment A num­ber of ex­press high­ways have been ini­ti­ated and built on the African con­ti­nent. For ex­am­ple, the $476m ex­press high­way between Kam­pala and En­tebbe in Uganda, and the Omakange and Rua­cana road up­grade in Namibia. Sadly, SA’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem is not a peo­ple-cen­tred op­er­a­tion. Even the last mega projects, the Gau­train and the roads in Gauteng, have sadly placed profit and “sus­tain­abil­ity” as core pri­or­i­ties. In par­tic­u­lar, Prasa and Metro­rail have had a chal­lenge with the on­slaught of at­tacks against their rail­way in­fra­struc­ture in the Western Cape. Metro­rail, to­gether with na­tional, pro­vin­cial and lo­cal gov­ern­ment, has launched the rail­way en­force­ment unit in Cape Town. Ac­cord­ing to news re­ports, the pri­or­ity of this unit is not the safety of com­muters, but rather “pro­tect­ing rail in­fra­struc­ture and sta­bil­is­ing train ser­vices”. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices, it would seem that SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude from those man­ag­ing our pub­lic trans­port sys­tem not to sim­ply main­tain old lega­cies, but to build new ones for the peo­ple. For this is what peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­ment is ul­ti­mately about.

za,Cape Times,20210112,AfCFTA trade rules and tar­iff sched­ul­ing ex­pected by mid year,"MEM­BERS of Africa's new free trade area should com­plete their tar­iff re­duc­tion sched­ules and fi­nalise es­sen­tial rules of ori­gin by July, a se­nior of­fi­cial with the bloc's sec­re­tar­iat said this week. African coun­tries be­gan of­fi­cially trad­ing un­der the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) on Jan­uary 1, af­ter months of de­lays caused by the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Ex­perts, how­ever, say full im­ple­men­ta­tion will likely take years. Un­der the agree­ment es­tab­lish­ing the AfCFTA, mem­bers must phase out 90% of tar­iff lines over the next 5-10 years. An­other 7% con­sid­ered sen­si­tive will get more time, while 3% will be al­lowed to be placed on an ex­clu­sion list. A to­tal of 41 of the zone's 54 mem­ber states have sub­mit­ted tar­iff re­duc­tion sched­ules. Mean­while, the rules of ori­gin – an es­sen­tial step for de­ter­min­ing which prod­ucts can be sub­ject to tar­iffs and du­ties – must also be com­pleted. Dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion at the Reuters Next con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Sil­ver Ojakol, chief of staff at the AfCFTA Sec­re­tar­iat, said nearly 90% of the rules of ori­gin had now been agreed. “So the re­main­ing 10% must be com­pleted by July this year,” he said. “By the end of June, we should have com­pleted both the tar­iff sched­ul­ing and the rules of ori­gin.” The AfCFTA aims to bring to­gether 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple in a $3.4 tril­lion (R53 tril­lion) eco­nomic bloc that will be the largest free trade area since the es­tab­lish­ment of the World Trade Or­ga­ni­za­tion. The World Bank es­ti­mates it could lift tens of mil­lions out of poverty by 2035. But Ojakol said that the re­main­ing ob­sta­cles were not sim­ply re­lated to tar­iff har­mon­i­sa­tion. “The big­gest chal­lenge per­haps is in­fra­struc­ture in­ter­con­nec­tiv­ity to ease trad­ing,” he said. Africa's poor road and rail links and ex­ces­sive bor­der bu­reau­cracy will not dis­ap­pear overnight. The AFC re­cently se­cured $250 mil­lion in fi­nanc­ing from the US De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion to help fund in­fra­struc­ture projects on the con­ti­nent, and many mem­ber states have MOUs with China's Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. A NEW year and a new be­gin­ning! That’s on the wish list of Wamkele Ke­abetswe Mene, the in­au­gu­ral sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Ac­cra-based African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCTA), the world’s new­est and largest free trade area, which went live on New Year’s Day. The mu­sic at the launch, Oh, Sons and Daugh­ters of Africa, was spot on. For 42-year-old Mene, born in Uiten­hage in the East­ern Cape, is a scion of the new South Africa – a mere 16-yearold when Nel­son Man­dela be­came the first pres­i­dent of the demo­cratic era in 1994. As a trade diplo­mat, he headed the SA Mis­sion to the World Trade Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WTO) and was South Africa’s chief ne­go­tia­tor in the AfCFTA ne­go­ti­a­tions. Mene is one of the new breed of self-con­fi­dent young Africans on the ris­ing con­ti­nent for whom the old or­der char­ac­terised by gov­er­nance deficits, bu­reau­cratic paral­y­sis and self-in­ter­est is passé. His mantra of “One con­ti­nent, one free trade area” sounds be­guil­ing, but is un­der­pinned by a de­ter­mi­na­tion that AfCFTA “should not be a mere trade agree­ment but in­stru­ments for Africa’s de­vel­op­ment”, with the aim of lift­ing 100 mil­lion out of poverty over the next decade. South Africa has much vested in AfCFTA. Pre­to­ria hosted the ini­tial ne­go­ti­a­tions for AfCFTA in Jo­han­nes­burg in 2015. Per­haps Mene got his cue from Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa, who in his ca­pac­ity as AU chair­per­son presided at the 13th Ex­tra­or­di­nary Ses­sion of the AU Assem­bly in De­cem­ber which for­malised the Jan­uary 1 launch. “At its core,” he said, “is a de­vel­op­men­tal ap­proach that seeks to lib­er­alise trade, build value chains and over­come the in­fra­struc­ture deficit on the con­ti­nent. Our con­ti­nent is one of the fastest-grow­ing mar­kets in the world with more than a bil­lion con­sumers. AfCFTA brings with it the prom­ise of new be­gin­nings and in­creased op­por­tu­ni­ties for our con­ti­nent and its peo­ple.” The ful­fil­ment of that prom­ise is laced with caveats – the most press­ing is the mit­i­ga­tion of the eco­nomic, trade and health im­pact of Covid-19. Africa has been spared the worst rav­ages, es­pe­cially of the sec­ond wave, with 1 996 046 con­firmed cases on Jan­uary 7, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion (WHO). But its largest econ­omy, South Africa, ac­counted for a cu­mu­la­tive 1 113 349 in­fec­tions re­sult­ing in more than 31 000 deaths. The surge pre­cip­i­tated a tougher lock­down regime which is dif­fi­cult to main­tain, given that it is mid-sum­mer and mask-wear­ing and phys­i­cal-dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols are openly flouted by some. Covid-19 in South Africa, says WHO, is largely spread through com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. Glob­ally, 85 mil­lion Covid-19 cases are con­firmed, re­sult­ing in more than 1.9 mil­lion deaths and ris­ing, es­pe­cially in North and South Amer­ica and Europe. Could AfCTA then be a gamechanger for in­tra-Africa trade, GDP growth, pros­per­ity and greater in­ward for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment flows? Jan Friederich, the se­nior direc­tor of Mid­dle East and Africa sov­er­eign rat­ings at Fitch, is “scep­ti­cal that AfCFTA could make a big dif­fer­ence to growth in the re­gion. This re­flects ex­pe­ri­ence with sub-re­gional free trade ar­eas which have of­ten been im­ple­mented only half-heart­edly and it is not clear that this would change for AfCFTA.” The im­pact of the East African Com­mu­nity cus­toms union, for ex­am­ple, has been lim­ited by a lack of in­te­gra­tion and re­moval of non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers, de­spite its 15-year his­tory. Mene has his work cut out. The con­ti­nent, he says, is char­ac­terised with mar­ket frag­men­ta­tion; mea­gre size of na­tional economies; over-re­liance on pri­mary com­modi­ties ex­ports; a nar­row ex­port base, caused by shal­low man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity; a lack of ex­port spe­cial­i­sa­tion; un­der­de­vel­oped in­dus­trial re­gional value chains; and high reg­u­la­tory and tar­iff bar­ri­ers to in­tra-Africa trade. It’s not sur­pris­ing that in­tra-Africa trade, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund, is very low, at 18%. The two largest African economies, South Africa and Nige­ria, ex­port only 26% and 12% of their to­tal ex­ports to African coun­tries. AfCFTA is set to re­duce tar­iff and non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers be­tween its 54 AU mem­ber states, ex­cept Eritrea. The agree­ment com­mits sig­na­to­ries to the phased re­moval of tar­iffs on 90% of goods and pro­vides mech­a­nisms for the res­o­lu­tion of trade dis­putes. It also in­cludes the am­bi­tion to lower non-tar­iff trade bar­ri­ers, lib­er­alise trade in ser­vices, and ad­vance mu­tual recog­ni­tion of stan­dards and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion. The prob­lem with trade agree­ments is ef­fec­tive im­ple­men­ta­tion through rat­i­fi­ca­tion, and en­force­ment. “Gov­ern­ments,” adds Fitch’s Friederich, “may be un­will­ing to ac­cept lim­i­ta­tions on their abil­ity to en­act pol­icy, par­tic­u­larly if trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion re­quires po­lit­i­cally un­pop­u­lar de­ci­sions or in­ter­feres with do­mes­tic sub­si­dies and ex­change con­trols.” Africa has a mar­ket of 1.2 bil­lion peo­ple and a com­bined GDP of $2.5 tril­lion (R38 tril­lion). African in­dus­tries have the po­ten­tial to dou­ble pro­duc­tion to $1 tril­lion in a decade, with much of that growth com­ing from im­port sub­sti­tu­tion man­u­fac­tur­ing to meet in­creas­ing lo­cal de­mand. There is the po­ten­tial in the longer term, says Fitch, for AfCTFA to have a pos­i­tive ef­fect on eco­nomic poli­cies and to sup­port growth and cred­it­wor­thi­ness in­di­rectly. As Ramaphosa re­minded his fel­low lead­ers: “If AfCFTA is to suc­ceed, we have to over­come the con­ti­nent’s po­lit­i­cal and so­cio-eco­nomic chal­lenges. We have to ad­dress is­sues of poverty, in­equal­ity and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. We have to ad­dress is­sues of se­cu­rity and in­sta­bil­ity, which are caus­ing un­told suf­fer­ing for the African peo­ple and hold­ing us back from re­al­is­ing our full po­ten­tial.” That walk to the promised land of African eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion may in­deed be very long.",南非
za,Daily News,20181107,CAPE TRANS­PORT IN­VEST­MENT IS IM­PER­A­TIVE,"RE­CENTLY China opened the world’s long­est sea bridge. Of­fi­cially called the Hong Kong-Ma­cau-Zhuhai bridge, the struc­ture, which cost $20 bil­lion (about R285bn), is about 55km long and while for the most part it crosses wa­ter, it also has a 7km tun­nel. The con­struc­tion of the bridge took eight years, and now con­nects main­land China (Zhuhai) to the semi­au­tonomous re­gions of Hong Kong and Ma­cau. Be­fore the bridge was built, it took three hours to travel between Zhuhai and Hong Kong. Now it takes 30 min­utes. By build­ing this bridge it is sug­gested that Bei­jing seeks to en­sure that the Greater Bay Area be­comes a tech­no­log­i­cal and in­no­va­tion-fo­cused zone. Au­thor­i­ties in Bei­jing sug­gest that by 2030, nearly 30 000 ve­hi­cles and nearly 130 000 pas­sen­ger trips would utilise the bridge daily. Most im­por­tantly, it in­te­grates the three ter­ri­to­ries and gives life to the “One China” pol­icy. China, a de­vel­op­ing coun­try once plagued with op­pres­sion, in­equal­ity, dis­ease, famine and poverty, has now emerged as a de­vel­oped na­tion. As we en­ter a new phase of glob­al­i­sa­tion and with the on­set of the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, at the 13th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­gress in 2017, in­tro­duced the Xi Thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New Era. Meet­ing with 13 African heads of state on the side­lines of his first BRICS Sum­mit in SA in 2013, Xi em­pha­sised the need for in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture on the African con­ti­nent. This is not far from the em­pha­sis placed on the in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture by the AU’s Agenda 2063. By us­ing it­self as a roadmap, China, Xi pointed out, wished to en­sure that African peo­ple them­selves were in­ter­con­nected and en­abled to con­nect with each other. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices … SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude of peo­ple­cen­tred de­vel­op­ment A num­ber of ex­press high­ways have been ini­ti­ated and built on the African con­ti­nent. For ex­am­ple, the $476m ex­press high­way between Kam­pala and En­tebbe in Uganda, and the Omakange and Rua­cana road up­grade in Namibia. Sadly, SA’s pub­lic trans­port sys­tem is not a peo­ple-cen­tred op­er­a­tion. Even the last mega projects, the Gau­train and the roads in Gauteng, have sadly placed profit and “sus­tain­abil­ity” as core pri­or­i­ties. In par­tic­u­lar, Prasa and Metro­rail have had a chal­lenge with the on­slaught of at­tacks against their rail­way in­fra­struc­ture in the Western Cape. Metro­rail, to­gether with na­tional, pro­vin­cial and lo­cal gov­ern­ment, has launched the rail­way en­force­ment unit in Cape Town. Ac­cord­ing to news re­ports, the pri­or­ity of this unit is not the safety of com­muters, but rather “pro­tect­ing rail in­fra­struc­ture and sta­bil­is­ing train ser­vices”. As a di­vided coun­try in ser­vices, it would seem that SA needs more than just bridges. It needs an at­ti­tude from those man­ag­ing our pub­lic trans­port sys­tem not to sim­ply main­tain old lega­cies, but to build new ones for the peo­ple. For this is what peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­ment is ul­ti­mately about.

za,The Mercury,20131118,China sets sights on ex­pand­ing work­force,"IN THE big­gest ex­pan­sion of eco­nomic free­doms since at least the 1990s, China’s lead­ers vowed to ex­pand farm­ers’ land rights, loosen the one-child pol­icy and en­cour­age pri­vate in­vest­ment in state busi­nesses. Cou­ples could have two chil­dren if ei­ther par­ent was an only child, the Com­mu­nist Party said on Fri­day, flesh­ing out poli­cies set at a four-day con­clave this month. Farm­ers will get more rights over col­lec­tively owned ru­ral land, while the house­hold reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem that im­pedes in­ter­nal mi­gra­tion will be scrapped in towns and small cities. The new lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang, in­stalled in March, is ac­cel­er­at­ing an un­wind­ing of Com­mu­nist Party eco­nomic poli­cies that orig­i­nated dur­ing or shortly af­ter the reign of Mao Ze­dong. The party needs to fuel growth to ce­ment its grip on power in the face of eco­nomic head­winds rang­ing from lo­cal gov­ern­ment debt to an ag­ing pop­u­la­tion that is set to shrink the na­tion’s work­force. “The bot­tom line is that there’s a sweep­ing re­form plan,” said Wang Tao, a Hong Kong-based econ­o­mist for UBS. “At least from the blue­print, it seems very ex­cit­ing.” The fam­ily plan­ning pol­icy, put in place three years af­ter Mao’s death in 1976, was in­tended to al­le­vi­ate poverty. It has sad­dled the na­tion with a de­clin­ing labour force: the UN es­ti­mates the num­ber of 15- to 24-year-olds, the main­stay of fac­to­ries that drove growth for two decades, will shrink by about 67 mil­lion by 2030. Un­der the cur­rent pol­icy, cou­ples are only al­lowed to have a sec­ond child if both par­ents are only chil­dren.

Carte Blanche fo­cused on sim­i­lar prob­lems in our in­land dams, so from a sci­en­tific point of view, the cus­to­di­ans of water man­age­ment are well aware of the threat to water qual­ity in South Africa. Yet the De­part­ment of Agri­cul­ture and En­vi­ron­men­tal Af­fairs has sat back and done ab­so­lutely noth­ing . This ar­ti­cle will, no doubt, catch the at­ten­tion of South Africans, as water is a key to sus­tain­able liv­ing; how­ever, our marine en­vi­ron­ment is also re­ceiv­ing bil­lions of litres of the same con­tam­i­nants (phos­pho­rus, chloro­phyll and bil­lions of litres of in­dus­trial ef­flu­ent be­ing pumped from in­dus­trial com­plexes). There are 19 pipe­lines be­tween Dur­ban and Park Rynie, all pump­ing ef­flu­ent car­ry­ing a wide range of com­pos­ites. The De­part­ment of Water Af­fairs is the cus­to­dian of th­ese pipe­lines, and is­sues the rel­e­vant per­mits. There has been a steady de­cline in fish catches, also well doc­u­mented, but only dealt with when a to­tal col­lapse of a spe­cific species be­comes ev­i­dent. All of th­ese is­sues have been well doc­u­mented, yet the rel­e­vant min­is­ters are ill-pre­pared and poorly ed­u­cated in this field. If they do not ad­dress the prob­lems shortly, not only will sourc­ing drink­ing water be­come a chal­lenge, but agri­cul­ture, marine sus­tain­abil­ity and other re­sources will be neg­a­tively af­fected.

za,The Star Late Edition,20150818,Rise in so­cial ten­sion likely in SA,"SOUTH Africa’s prob­lem of high un­em­ploy­ment and ris­ing in­equal­ity could be­come more en­trenched in the medium term, lead­ing to a rise in so­cial ten­sions, the World Bank said yesterday. In its sev­enth edi­tion of the South Africa Eco­nomic Up­date re­port, the World Bank noted China was still a ma­jor mar­ket for South African min­eral ex­ports and so this posed a risk to an al­ready weak eco­nomic out­look for South Africa were there to be a sharp slow down in China. It said South Africa’s large cur­rent ac­count deficit, fi­nanced heav­ily by cap­i­tal flows, made the econ­omy vul­ner­a­ble to shifts in in­vestor sen­ti­ment and chang­ing cap­i­tal flows that could arise in the con­text of a fall out from the “lift-off ” in in­ter­est rates in the US. Volatile The rand re­mained volatile yesterday and was flirt­ing at R12.90 to the dol­lar. At one stage it was trad­ing R12.9231, the lo­cal unit’s low­est level since De­cem­ber 2001, against the dol­lar be­fore re­ced­ing to R12.8781 at 6pm. This was mainly a re­sult of the dol­lar strength as con­cerns over Chi­nese de­val­u­a­tion of the yuan last week faded, said John Cairns, a cur­rency strate­gist at Rand Mer­chant Bank. Mo­hammed Nalla, the head of strate­gic re­search at Ned­bank, said a con­flu­ence of fac­tors have ma­te­ri­alised over a short pe­riod of time and had served as a cat­a­lyst for an un­der­ly­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity in emerg­ing mar­ket cur­ren­cies. “The rand is over­sold in the near term. How­ever, for as long as R12.70 re­mains a floor, it ap­pears to have es­tab­lished a weaker range, with only a break be­low this open­ing up fur­ther rand gains.” Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec, said she ex­pected the rand to trade in a range of be­tween R12.65 and R13.25 against the dol­lar this week. She said the rand would likely not strengthen mean­ing­fully ahead of the Septem­ber 17 US in­ter­est rate de­ci­sion. “The R13.25 against the dol­lar is the weak­est point I think the rand could reach this week,” she said. The World Bank forecast South Africa’s real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth at 2 per­cent this year, and to slowly strengthen to 2.4 per­cent in 2017. This forecast comes on the eve of the re­lease of the coun­try’s GDP data for the sec­ond quar­ter next Tues­day. This is sig­nif­i­cantly be­low the 4.1 per­cent quar­ter on quar­ter growth rate reg­is­tered in the fi­nal quar­ter of 2014. The re­port said over­all, growth in South Africa would re­main largely be­low the av­er­age growth of 4.2 per­cent and 4 per­cent for sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa in 2015 and 2016/17. It said while ad­dress­ing power short­ages would be crit­i­cal to re­mov­ing a key break on near-term growth, achiev­ing the 5 per­cent growth tar­get of the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Plan re­quired much more than that. “South Africa needs ur­gently to boost growth to this level if it is to pro­vide jobs for young work­ers, ad­dress its grow­ing so­cial ten­sions and re­duce its sub­stan­tial poverty and in­equal­ity.” The World Bank said im­proved labour re­la­tions for a start, matched by greater col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the public and pri­vate sec­tors, and pol­icy cer­tainty to im­prove busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, were fun­da­men­tal to restor­ing in­vestor con­fi­dence. It said do­mes­tic fac­tors con­tin­ued to im­pede re­cov­ery in its eco­nomic growth. Labour un­rest and elec­tric­ity short­ages held head­line GDP growth to just 1.5 per­cent in 2014, en­trench­ing the mod­er­a­tion in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity ev­i­dent since 2011. Poverty rates For the first time since 2009, ag­gre­gate eco­nomic growth fell short of pop­u­la­tion growth in 2014, re­duc­ing per capita real GDP by 0.4 per­cent to R55 712. “Poverty and in­equal­ity rates are there­fore likely to have stayed broadly un­changed from those recorded in 2010/11 house­hold ex­pen­di­ture sur­vey, where 21.7 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion are be­low the food poverty line (R335 per capita per month) and the Gini co­ef­fi­cient of in­come in­equal­ity stood at 0.69.” The World Bank said agri­cul­tural growth was ex­pected to be pulled down in the near term by the poor maize harvest, but fi­nance and busi­ness ser­vices are set to grow ro­bustly through­out the forecast pe­riod. Labour un­rest and elec­tric­ity short­ages held head­line GDP growth to just 1.5 per­cent in 2014. Struc­tural im­ped­i­ments would con­tinue to weigh heav­ily on growth, the bank added. These struc­tural fac­tors were re­in­forc­ing cycli­cal weak­ness in do­mes­tic de­mand. House­hold con­sump­tion was ex­pected to grow only mod­estly, while lower oil prices pro­vided only tem­po­rary re­lief to house­hold bud­gets and head­line in­fla­tion, the re­port added. It said con­cerns over elec­tric­ity sup­ply and ris­ing in­put and wage costs were be­ing com­pounded by broader com­mod­ity price weak­ness as well as pol­icy and reg­u­la­tory un­cer­tainty, and were likely to dampen the out­look for in­vest­ment, the re­port said. Labour re­la­tions were ex­pected to re­main dif­fi­cult in an en­vi­ron­ment of weak growth. The World Bank said on the pos­i­tive side, the re­cov­ery in ad­vanced coun­tries and still ro­bust growth in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa should boost de­mand for South Africa’s non-min­eral ex­ports. “Still, the an­tic­i­pated weak­ness in min­eral de­mand and prices limit the over­all im­prove­ment in the cur­rent ac­count deficit, which is ex­pected to stay el­e­vated at around 5 per­cent to 5.2 per­cent of GDP over the medium term.”",南非

It said South Africa’s large cur­rent ac­count deficit, fi­nanced heav­ily by cap­i­tal flows, made the econ­omy vul­ner­a­ble to shifts in in­vestor sen­ti­ment and chang­ing cap­i­tal flows that could arise in the con­text of a fall out from the “lift-off” in in­ter­est rates in the US. Volatile The rand re­mained volatile yesterday and was flirt­ing at R12.90 to the dol­lar. At one stage it was trad­ing R12.9231, the lo­cal unit’s low­est level since De­cem­ber 2001, against the dol­lar be­fore re­ced­ing to R12.8781 at 6pm. This was mainly a re­sult of the dol­lar strength as con­cerns over Chi­nese de­val­u­a­tion of the yuan last week faded, said John Cairns, a cur­rency strate­gist at Rand Mer­chant Bank. Mo­hammed Nalla, the head of strate­gic re­search at Ned­bank, said a con­flu­ence of fac­tors have ma­te­ri­alised over a short pe­riod of time and had served as a cat­a­lyst for an un­der­ly­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity in emerg­ing mar­ket cur­ren­cies. “The rand is over­sold in the near term. How­ever, for as long as R12.70 re­mains a floor, it ap­pears to have es­tab­lished a weaker range, with only a break be­low this open­ing up fur­ther rand gains.” Annabel Bishop, the chief economist at Investec, said she ex­pected the rand to trade in a range of be­tween R12.65 and R13.25 against the dol­lar this week. She said the rand would likely not strengthen mean­ing­fully ahead of the Septem­ber 17 US in­ter­est rate de­ci­sion. “The R13.25 against the dol­lar is the weak­est point I think the rand could reach this week,” she said. The World Bank forecast South Africa’s real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth at 2 per­cent this year, and to slowly strengthen to 2.4 per­cent in 2017. This forecast comes on the eve of the re­lease of the coun­try’s GDP data for the sec­ond quar­ter next Tues­day. This is sig­nif­i­cantly be­low the 4.1 per­cent quar­ter on quar­ter growth rate reg­is­tered in the fi­nal quar­ter of 2014. The re­port said over­all, growth in South Africa would re­main largely be­low the av­er­age growth of 4.2 per­cent and 4 per­cent for sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa in 2015 and 2016/17. It said while ad­dress­ing power short­ages would be crit­i­cal to re­mov­ing a key break on near-term growth, achiev­ing the 5 per­cent growth tar­get of the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Plan re­quired much more than that. “South Africa needs ur­gently to boost growth to this level if it is to pro­vide jobs for young work­ers, ad­dress its grow­ing so­cial ten­sions and re­duce its sub­stan­tial poverty and in­equal­ity.” The World Bank said im­proved labour re­la­tions for a start, matched by greater col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the public and pri­vate sec­tors, and pol­icy cer­tainty to im­prove busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, were fun­da­men­tal to restor­ing in­vestor con­fi­dence. It said do­mes­tic fac­tors con­tin­ued to im­pede re­cov­ery in its eco­nomic growth. Labour un­rest and elec­tric­ity short­ages held head­line GDP growth to just 1.5 per­cent in 2014, en­trench­ing the mod­er­a­tion in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity ev­i­dent since 2011. Poverty rates For the first time since 2009, ag­gre­gate eco­nomic growth fell short of pop­u­la­tion growth in 2014, re­duc­ing per capita real GDP by 0.4 per­cent to R55 712. “Poverty and in­equal­ity rates are there­fore likely to have stayed broadly un­changed from those recorded in 2010/11 house­hold ex­pen­di­ture sur­vey, where 21.7 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion are be­low the food poverty line (R335 per capita per month) and the Gini co­ef­fi­cient of in­come in­equal­ity stood at 0.69.” The World Bank said agri­cul­tural growth was ex­pected to be pulled down in the near term by the poor maize harvest, but fi­nance and busi­ness ser­vices are set to grow ro­bustly through­out the forecast pe­riod. Labour un­rest and elec­tric­ity short­ages held head­line GDP growth to just 1.5 per­cent in 2014. Struc­tural im­ped­i­ments would con­tinue to weigh heav­ily on growth, the bank added. These struc­tural fac­tors were re­in­forc­ing cycli­cal weak­ness in do­mes­tic de­mand. House­hold con­sump­tion was ex­pected to grow only mod­estly, while lower oil prices pro­vided only tem­po­rary re­lief to house­hold bud­gets and head­line in­fla­tion, the re­port added. It said con­cerns over elec­tric­ity sup­ply and ris­ing in­put and wage costs were be­ing com­pounded by broader com­mod­ity price weak­ness as well as pol­icy and reg­u­la­tory un­cer­tainty, and were likely to dampen the out­look for in­vest­ment, the re­port said. Labour re­la­tions were ex­pected to re­main dif­fi­cult in an en­vi­ron­ment of weak growth. The World Bank said on the pos­i­tive side, the re­cov­ery in ad­vanced coun­tries and still ro­bust growth in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa should boost de­mand for South Africa’s non-min­eral ex­ports. “Still, the an­tic­i­pated weak­ness in min­eral de­mand and prices limit the over­all im­prove­ment in the cur­rent ac­count deficit, which is ex­pected to stay el­e­vated at around 5 per­cent to 5.2 per­cent of GDP over the medium term.”",南非
za,Daily News,20181228,Taiwanese in yel­low vests protest against taxes,"THOU­SANDS of Taiwanese, tak­ing a page from France’s yel­low vest move­ment, protested yes­ter­day for the third time in a week to de­mand lower taxes and the fair han­dling of tax dis­putes. Wear­ing yel­low vests, they shouted slo­gans and blared air horns out­side the Min­istry of Fi­nance in Taipei, the cap­i­tal city, and waved ban­ners call­ing Tai­wan’s tax col­lec­tion poli­cies il­le­gal. Some wore clear plas­tic rain­coats over their vests in a light rain. “This is about our fu­tures,” said Joanna Tai, a 23-year-old English lan­guage grad­u­ate stu­dent who plans to teach after grad­u­a­tion next year. “We look at wages in Hong Kong and main­land China. We want to know why there’s so much of a gap with Tai­wan,” she said. “Then a lot of my class­mates want to start com­pa­nies and be their own bosses, but be­cause of taxes a lot of small busi­nesses have folded.” The Tax &amp; Le­gal Re­form League, an ac­tivist group, called the protest after mar­shalling about 20000 peo­ple out­side the pres­i­den­tial of­fice in an ini­tial demon­stra­tion a week ago, and an­other 10000 last Satur­day, ac­cord­ing to or­gan­is­ers and Taiwanese me­dia. The or­gan­is­ers said they were in­spired by the suc­cess of the re­cent French protests, which turned vi­o­lent and were blamed for 10 deaths. The Taiwanese protests have been peace­ful. French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron even­tu­ally agreed to scrap a tax hike for gaso­line and diesel, in­crease the min­i­mum salary for full­time work­ers and other steps. “We saw Macron and he wanted to soften up, so that gave us some en­cour­age­ment to protest, so we hope the pres­i­dent here can hear our voices,” Re­form League me­dia li­ai­son per­son Wang Chih-lan said. “The Min­istry of Fi­nance is the ma­jor cul­prit. It’s a big or­gan­i­sa­tion that’s caus­ing poverty in Tai­wan.” A min­istry spokesper­son said ear­lier this week that anti-tax ac­tivists had been push­ing for lower taxes for 20 years. Tsai Meng-chu said the min­istry had re­sponded to some of their com­plaints on its web­site, in­clud­ing a re­but­tal to al­le­ga­tions that the tax sys­tem con­trib­uted to poverty. “Their com­plaints are just that they’re not sat­is­fied with the tax sys­tem,” she said, not­ing that Tai­wan of­fered pay­ment de­fer­rals to low-in­come in­di­vid­u­als. |",南非
za,Weekend Post (South Africa),20160227,Learn­ing to live with less dur­ing hard times,"IN the past weeks there has been a word on ev­ery­one’s lips. It’s the same word that’s been on the lips of the world for some time. The word is “aus­ter­ity”. de­fines aus­ter­ity as “the con­di­tion of liv­ing with­out un­nec­es­sary things and with­out com­fort, with lim­ited money or goods, or a prac­tice, habit, or ex­pe­ri­ence that is typ­i­cal of this”. The ex­am­ples it gives are “the wartime aus­ter­ity of my early years pre­pared me for later hard­ships” and “the aus­ter­i­ties of life in a small ru­ral com­mu­nity were not what I was used to”. Read­ing those ex­am­ples I re­alised that aus­ter­ity, which seems such a hard­ship for some, is the norm for so many peo­ple in the world be­cause for mil­lions, life is aus­tere drudgery. With this in mind I went dig­ging for some sta­tis­tics and turned up the fol­low­ing. For this ex­er­cise let’s imag­ine that the world pop­u­la­tion of 7.4 bil­lion was re­duced to 100 peo­ple. Of those 100, 26 would be chil­dren. There would be 74 adults, eight of whom would be 65 and older. There would be 60 Asians, 15 Africans, 14 peo­ple from the Amer­i­cas, and 11 Euro­peans. Thirty-three would be Chris­tians, 22 Mus­lims, 14 Hin­dus, 7 Bud­dhists, 12 peo­ple who prac­tice other re­li­gions and an­other 12 who would not be aligned with a re­li­gion. Eighty-three would be able to read and write; 17 would not. Seven would have a univer­sity de­gree, 22 would own or share a com­puter, 77 peo­ple would have a place to shel­ter them from the wind and the rain, but 23 would not. One would be dy­ing of star­va­tion, 15 would be un­der­nour­ished and an up-sized 21 would be over­weight. Eighty-seven would have ac­cess to safe drink­ing wa­ter – 13 peo­ple would have no clean, safe wa­ter to drink. An Afrikaans say­ing, that trans­lates to, “You are com­plain­ing while hold­ing a loaf of bread in your hand”, ap­plies here. Aus­ter­ity may be dif­fi­cult and un­com­fort­able but it is a far cry from poverty, which is deadly. Aus­ter­ity doesn’t kill you, it re­fo­cuses your pri­or­i­ties. The World Bank re­ports that in 2012 (their most re­cent sta­tis­tics) 896 mil­lion peo­ple, or 12.7%, lived on less than $1.90 (R29) per day, down from 37% in 1990 and 44% in 1981. This good news of the de­cline in world poverty is tem­pered by data that most of the de­crease has been in China where in 30 years 753 mil­lion Chi­nese moved above the $1.90 poverty thresh­old. In Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa 42.6% of peo­ple lived on less than R29 per day in 2012. It is a hall­mark of all the world’s re­li­gions that sim­plic­ity of life and gen­eros­ity to the poor are virtues to be cul­ti­vated. An au­then­tic per­son of faith is one who takes care of their do­mes­tic re­spon­si­bil­i­ties but looks out for the less for­tu­nate too. So thank you Fi­nance Min­is­ter Pravin Gord­han for tight­en­ing my belt. It may help me live more sim­ply so that oth­ers may sim­ply live.",南非
za,The Star Late Edition,20190214,"China’s eco­nomic slump is a re­sult of favour­ing SOEs over pri­vate en­ter­prise, writes Kabelo Khumalo |","THE UNIMAG­IN­ABLE has hap­pened. The Chi­nese econ­omy in 2018 slowed to its low­est level in nearly three decades, leav­ing pun­dits to try to fig­ure out how deep the slump is. This means Beijing en­tered this week’s trade talks with the US in an un­fa­mil­iar po­si­tion: that of vul­ner­a­bil­ity. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump would have us be­lieve that China’s down­turn was largely due to the bar­rage of tar­iffs he un­leashed on the US’s eco­nomic ri­val. This is not nec­es­sar­ily true. China is now a mid­dle-in­come coun­try and it was im­pos­si­ble for it to main­tain dou­ble-digit growth in­def­i­nitely. It is not just the pace, but the na­ture of the Chi­nese econ­omy that has changed, mean­ing that the coun­try has to tra­verse a dif­fi­cult political av­enue: to re­form and open up the econ­omy to make it more pro­duc­tive. Herein are lessons for the South African econ­omy and the pal­pa­ble para­noia over the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of our state-owned en­ti­ties (SOEs). South Africa’s SOEs have meta­mor­phosed into state-owned prob­lems, with tax­pay­ers left to foot the com­pa­nies’ grow­ing bills. SOEs have time and time again proved not to be a sound in­vest­ment. Deng Xiaop­ing’s 1978 re­forms gave China eco­nomic might, build­ing from scratch a prof­itable pri­vate sec­tor that saw mil­lions of peo­ple lifted out of poverty. How­ever, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has re­fo­cused his ad­min­is­tra­tion on build­ing up state-owned com­pa­nies. For ex­am­ple, in 2016, pri­vate firms held 11 per­cent of new loans, while state-owned com­pa­nies got 83 per­cent in new loans. This is in stark con­trast to the 2010 pic­ture where pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies got 43 per­cent of loans and state com­pa­nies had a 36 per­cent share of new loans that year. China’s debt is pub­lic, not pri­vate, which means that the risks are largely borne by the state. What is clear is that while Chi­nese lead­ers have called for a re­form of its SOEs, the re­forms have largely meant the strength­en­ing of the com­pa­nies and not break­ing their stran­gle­hold on the econ­omy. The SOEs touch ev­ery sec­tor of the Chi­nese econ­omy, rang­ing from telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion to fi­nance. When China joined the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, it gave an un­der­tak­ing to open it­self up to for­eign­ers in lu­cra­tive busi­nesses like bank­ing, tele­coms and elec­tronic-pay­ment pro­cess­ing. How­ever, nearly two decades later, China’s tele­coms in­dus­try is still firmly un­der govern­ment con­trol. Be­cause Chi­nese state com­pa­nies en­joy un­fil­tered easy ac­cess to state as­sis­tance and loans, they amassed as­sets that make the pri­vate sec­tor find it harder to com­pete. How­ever, with data in­di­cat­ing that China’s pri­vate sec­tor is con­tribut­ing 60 per­cent of the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and 80 per­cent of em­ploy­ment, Beijing is in­creas­ingly aware it can no longer favour state com­pa­nies over the pri­vate sec­tor. Xi last year ad­mit­ted as much: “We will re­in­force the de­vel­op­ment of the state econ­omy while guid­ing the de­vel­op­ment of the non-state econ­omy,” he said. Political par­ties like the Eco­nomic Free­dom Fight­ers and for­ma­tions like Cosatu, Numsa and the South African Com­mu­nist Party frown on the word “pri­vati­sa­tion”. The move­ments be­lieve the fu­ture is red and that the mar­ket econ­omy should be reined in as it has led to in­equal­ity. But how does it profit the South African econ­omy and its peo­ple to keep cash-burn­ing en­ti­ties like Eskom, South African Air­ways and PetroSA in op­er­a­tion? The in­sis­tence that we own as­sets like Eskom and SAA is akin to a man who stub­bornly re­fuses to let go of a run-down BMW he has owned for 30 years, hop­ing to pass it on in­tact to his beloved son. It would ap­pear our SOEs are in a dog­fight to show which one will be the big­gest bur­den and em­bar­rass­ment to the coun­try. The num­bers speak for them­selves. The govern­ment’s ex­po­sure to SOE debt has risen from R160 bil­lion in 2011 to R308bn in 2017, while Eskom’s debt reached 8.5 per­cent of GDP late last year. Num­bers from S&amp;P Global Ratings are even more fright­en­ing. S&amp;P, see govern­ment guar­an­tees for SOEs’ debt ris­ing to R500bn by 2020, or 10 per­cent of GDP. It has be­come near im­pos­si­ble for the Na­tional Trea­sury to keep to its fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion path while bail­ing out our ail­ing SOEs. The stub­born in­sis­tence that we stay in abu­sive re­la­tion­ships with our un­der­per­form­ing SOEs means that, in the end, the poor and work­ing class, whom anti-pri­vati­sa­tion cru­saders want to pro­tect, will them­selves be state-owned; for­ever be­holden to the state to eke out a liv­ing.",南非
za,The Citizen (Gauteng),20190312,Open­ing a win­dow to the world,"Just 17 coun­tries still recog­nise Tai­wan’s claim of be­ing the one true China. From bat­tling a storm in the Solomon Is­lands to con­sult­ing a witch doc­tor in eSwa­tini, Ben Wu has trekked some of the world’s less-trod­den paths as he em­barks on a quest to visit all of Tai­wan’s dwin­dling diplo­matic al­lies. The list of coun­tries he must visit is short – just 17 na­tions still recog­nise Tai­wan over main­land China, a vivid il­lus­tra­tion of the demo­cratic is­land’s in­ter­na­tional iso­la­tion as Bei­jing uses its clout to woo Taipei’s few re­main­ing friends. In all prac­ti­cal ways, Tai­wan is a de facto in­de­pen­dent coun­try. But both Taipei and Bei­jing in­sist they are the one true China and that other na­tions can recog­nise only one of them. Most have sided with China as its po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic might has grown. Last year, Wu, 25, was hav­ing a meet­ing in Tai­wan’s for­eign min­istry on the day El Sal­vador just hap­pened to be­come the lat­est coun­try to switch its recog­ni­tion to Bei­jing. He watched as his coun­try’s flag was re­moved from the min­istry’s en­trance. “I think most young peo­ple only know about our al­lies when there is a ter­mi­na­tion of diplo­matic re­la­tions and this is not good,” Wu told AFP at his home in Taipei. “They should know about the al­lies in other ways.” Us­ing YouTube, Wu is try­ing to change that. He came up with the idea to visit the re­main­ing al­lies while rid­ing the Trans-Siberian Rail­way. Flick­ing through a news ar­ti­cle about Tai­wan’s al­lies, he re­alised he only recog­nised three – Haiti, Tu­valu and the Vatican. “I love travel and some of Tai­wan’s diplo­matic al­lies are less known and more dif­fi­cult to reach. “I hope to ex­plore th­ese coun­tries that fewer peo­ple have trav­elled to and be a part of ‘peo­ple diplo­macy’,” he said. So far Wu has ticked off five al­lies in the Pa­cific – Tu­valu, Nauru, Kiri­bati, the Mar­shall Is­lands and the Solomon Is­lands – as well as the only ally in Africa, eSwa­tini. This month, he sets out for Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean to visit Gu­atemala, Hon­duras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Haiti, Belize, Saint Lu­cia, St Vin­cent and the Gre­nadines, as well as St Kitts and Nevis. He will wrap up his quest with the Vatican and Palau. Tai­wan has not al­ways been diplo­mat­i­cally iso­lated. After its split from the main­land in 1949, when the com­mu­nists de­feated Chiang Kai-shek’s na­tion­al­ists, it was the Repub­lic of China that was recog­nised by the ma­jor­ity, not the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC). The global re­ver­sal be­gan in earnest in 1971 when Tai­wan – then in the grip of Chiang’s mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor­ship – was kicked out of the in­ter­na­tional club by the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly, which recog­nised the PRC as “the only le­git­i­mate rep­re­sen­ta­tive of China”. Al­lies be­gan fall­ing like domi­noes, with Wash­ing­ton switch­ing recog­ni­tion in 1979 – although it re­mains a key mil­i­tary backer and sup­plies Tai­wan with most of its weaponry. Those na­tions that re­mained tended to be im­pov­er­ished, smaller coun­tries in the Pa­cific, Africa and Latin Amer­ica who have since be­come easy pick­ings as China mor­phed from dys­func­tion and poverty into the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy. After the 2016 elec­tion of Tai­wanese Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen – who hails from an in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing party – Bei­jing has launched a cam­paign to fur­ther un­der­mine the is­land’s sovereignty. Five al­lies have been poached, it blocked Taipei from at­tend­ing ma­jor global gath­er­ings and pres­sured a string of in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing air­lines and ho­tels, to list Tai­wan as part of China. J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based ex­pert at the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham’s Tai­wan Stud­ies Pro­gramme, said the re­main­ing al­lies most at risk of switch­ing are those in the Pa­cific. “Bei­jing is hard at work try­ing to sway those,” he told AFP, ad­ding China may try to lure fur­ther de­fec­tions as Tsai seeks re-elec­tion in 2020. But he added that Tai­wan un­der Tsai had made “sub­stan­tial progress strength­en­ing ties with un­of­fi­cial al­lies that, in the end, are far more in­flu­en­tial, both in terms of their diplo­matic weight and size of their economies, than the small states with which it has of­fi­cial diplo­matic re­la­tions.” Wu said he wanted greater aware­ness of those who have stayed loyal to Tai­wan, even if some­where like Tu­valu only boasts some 12 000 peo­ple. “Th­ese coun­tries have a voice in in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. They can speak up for Tai­wan and let more peo­ple know about Tai­wan’s dif­fi­cult diplo­matic sit­u­a­tion,” he said. Wu’s YouTube videos on his chan­nel Ben’s Ad­ven­tures have racked up tens of thou­sands of views and turned into a ca­reer. One shows him bashed by a storm in a rick­ety boat after see­ing hu­man skulls left by head hunters in the Solomon Is­lands. Oth­ers show him con­sult­ing a witch doc­tor in a dark room filled with bags of herbs in eSwa­tini, eat­ing be­tel nuts in Kiri­bati and find­ing Tai­wanese food in a Mar­shall Is­lands su­per­mar­ket. Wu says he hopes other young Tai­wanese might fol­low in his foot­steps. “I hope to in­tro­duce the cul­ture, tra­di­tion, cus­tom and sight­see­ing of our al­lies in a re­lax­ing way so peo­ple can get to know th­ese coun­tries. I am open­ing a win­dow, a door and peo­ple can ex­plore the rest.” –",南非
za,Cape Argus,20181105,Stop blam­ing colo­nial­ism,"SINCE the end of colo­nial­ism, apartheid and white-mi­nor­ity gov­ern­ments, a de­bil­i­tat­ing cul­ture of vic­tim­hood has been un­der­min­ing de­vel­op­ment in African coun­tries. Linked to this is the ex­pec­ta­tion that “oth­ers” – for­mer colo­nial pow­ers, new emerg­ing pow­ers or for­eign in­vestors – will res­cue Africa, ei­ther be­cause his­tor­i­cally they had ex­ploited the con­ti­nent or, in the case of China, be­cause they are “our friends”. There is also of­ten the ex­pec­ta­tion that for­eign in­vestors will solve Africa’s de­vel­op­ment prob­lems out of a sense of benev­o­lence. The hard truth, though, is that out­siders will not save Africa. For­mer colo­nial pow­ers will not sud­denly ac­knowl­edge mea culpa and fund re­con­struc­tion pro­jects in Africa to atone for colo­nial­ism and slav­ery. New emerg­ing pow­ers such as China or Saudi Ara­bia won’t benev­o­lently sink money into the con­ti­nent – they want a re­turn on their in­vest­ment. Colo­nial­ism, apartheid and Western im­pe­ri­al­ists are of­ten blamed for Africa’s self-in­flicted prob­lems, to create a smoke­screen to cover up self-en­rich­ment, in­com­pe­tence and cor­rup­tion by lead­ers and elites. It has also be­come fash­ion­able in South Africa to lay the blame on “white monopoly cap­i­tal”, short­hand for for­eign com­pa­nies and lo­cal white­owned com­pa­nies. Last year, cel­e­brat­ing 60 years of in­de­pen­dence, Ghana’s Pres­i­dent Nana Akufo-Addo rightly said the coun­try had run out of ex­cuses for fail­ing to end poverty and cor­rup­tion. He added that it was silly to blame colo­nial­ism for Ghana’s high lev­els of poverty, un­der­de­vel­op­ment and home­less­ness. While for­mer pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma built a R280-mil­lion man­sion as his sup­port­ers lived in squalor, he blamed “white monopoly cap­i­tal” and Western “im­pe­ri­al­ists”, mean­ing for­mer colo­nial pow­ers, for want­ing to desta­bilise his pres­i­dency. For­mer Zim­bab­wean pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe plun­dered the state, which led to eco­nomic col­lapse. Hav­ing been in power since 1980, he blamed this on white farm­ers, the coun­try’s for­mer colo­nial ruler, Bri­tain, and do­mes­tic black “pup­pets” of “im­pe­ri­al­ists”. How­ever, one must ask if it is ra­tio­nal to blame the poor de­ci­sion-mak­ing that leads to lack of pub­lic ser­vice de­liv­ery and mis­man­age­ment on colo­nial­ism, apartheid and white monopoly cap­i­tal. It is true that the en­dur­ing con­se­quences of slav­ery, colo­nial­ism and apartheid have stunted the de­vel­op­ment of many African coun­tries and that global busi­ness ac­tiv­ity favours in­dus­tri­alised na­tions. Global com­pa­nies also dom­i­nate African mar­kets, as do white-owned com­pa­nies in coun­tries with large set­tler com­mu­ni­ties, such as South Africa, Namibia and Zim­babwe. It is there­fore im­per­a­tive that mar­kets are de­ra­cialised so that black busi­nesses can com­pete fairly. How­ever, many African lead­ers – in or­der to en­rich them­selves, re­main in power and op­press their peo­ple – con­tinue to cyn­i­cally pro­mote the idea of African coun­tries be­ing pow­er­less vic­tims against the machi­na­tions of for­mer colo­nial pow­ers. Many African civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions, aca­demics and ac­tivists also con­tinue to blame colo­nial­ism and apartheid for the con­ti­nent’s self-in­flicted de­vel­op­ment prob­lems. This con­tin­ues through the gen­er­a­tions, cre­at­ing new loops of vic­tim­hood. How­ever, this blame game numbs creative think­ing and sup­presses new ideas and so­lu­tions for deal­ing with the con­ti­nent’s prob­lems. It also means that African gov­ern­ments shirk on their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to their vot­ers. It has fur­ther made it dif­fi­cult to hold African lead­ers and gov­ern­ments ac­count­able for wrong­do­ing. It also means that Africans out­source so­lu­tions to their prob­lems to out­siders. Vic­tim­hood paral­y­ses Africans from tak­ing con­trol of their own lives and the fu­ture of their coun­tries. De­vel­op­ment prob­lems can be blamed on African lead­ers en­rich­ing them­selves, their fam­i­lies and eth­nic groups; ap­point­ing in­com­pe­tent cronies to pub­lic ser­vices; hand­ing over pub­lic ser­vice con­tracts to fake com­pa­nies; and fail­ing to come up with cred­i­ble poli­cies. It is in­struc­tive to see East Asia’s for­mer colonies, such as South Korea and Sin­ga­pore, tak­ing con­trol of their own des­tinies and even sur­pass­ing their for­mer colo­nial pow­ers in terms of de­vel­op­ment. African lead­ers, gov­ern­ments and cit­i­zens must re­alise that there will be no out­side saviours, that for­mer colo­nial pow­ers are not in­ter­ested in giv­ing Africans repa­ra­tions for past wrong­do­ings, and that Africans are on their own. Out­siders are busy find­ing an­swers to their own prob­lems. There is no dig­nity, pros­per­ity and con­fi­dence in vic­tim­hood.

za,Daily News,20181105,Stop blam­ing colo­nial­ism,"SINCE the end of colo­nial­ism, apartheid and white-mi­nor­ity gov­ern­ments, a de­bil­i­tat­ing cul­ture of vic­tim­hood has been un­der­min­ing de­vel­op­ment in African coun­tries. Linked to this is the ex­pec­ta­tion that “oth­ers” – for­mer colo­nial pow­ers, new emerg­ing pow­ers or for­eign in­vestors – will res­cue Africa, ei­ther be­cause his­tor­i­cally they had ex­ploited the con­ti­nent or, in the case of China, be­cause they are “our friends”. There is also often the ex­pec­ta­tion that for­eign in­vestors will solve Africa’s de­vel­op­ment prob­lems out of a sense of benev­o­lence. The hard truth, though, is that out­siders will not save Africa. For­mer colo­nial pow­ers will not sud­denly ac­knowl­edge mea culpa and fund re­con­struc­tion projects in Africa to atone for colo­nial­ism and slav­ery. New emerg­ing pow­ers such as China or Saudi Ara­bia won’t benev­o­lently sink money into the con­ti­nent – they want a re­turn on their in­vest­ment. Colo­nial­ism, apartheid and West­ern im­pe­ri­al­ists are often blamed for Africa’s self-in­flicted prob­lems, to cre­ate a smoke­screen to cover up self-en­rich­ment, in­com­pe­tence and cor­rup­tion by lead­ers and elites. It has also be­come fash­ion­able in South Africa to lay the blame on “white mo­nop­oly cap­i­tal”, short­hand for for­eign com­pa­nies and lo­cal white­owned com­pa­nies. Last year, cel­e­brat­ing 60 years of in­de­pen­dence, Ghana’s Pres­i­dent Nana Akufo-Addo rightly said the coun­try had run out of ex­cuses for fail­ing to end poverty and cor­rup­tion. He added that it was silly to blame colo­nial­ism for Ghana’s high lev­els of poverty, un­der­de­vel­op­ment and home­less­ness. While for­mer pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma built a R280-mil­lion man­sion as his sup­port­ers lived in squalor, he blamed “white mo­nop­oly cap­i­tal” and West­ern “im­pe­ri­al­ists”, mean­ing for­mer colo­nial pow­ers, for want­ing to desta­bilise his pres­i­dency. For­mer Zim­bab­wean pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe plun­dered the state, which led to eco­nomic col­lapse. Hav­ing been in power since 1980, he blamed this on white farm­ers, the coun­try’s for­mer colo­nial ruler, Bri­tain, and do­mes­tic black “pup­pets” of “im­pe­ri­al­ists”.

za,The Sunday Independent,20190929,It’s High Time to Deepen Mu­tu­ally Ben­e­fi­cial Eco­nomic and Trade Co­op­er­a­tion,"In Oc­to­ber 2017, the first batch of South African seaborne frozen beef en­tered China from Shang­hai and for­mally ap­peared on Chi­nese peo­ple’s din­ner ta­bles. That year, China im­ported 967 tons of beef from South Africa, and the num­ber soared to 6,639 tons in 2018. If it weren’t for the FMD “ac­ci­dent” at the be­gin­ning of this year, South Africa is likely to oc­cupy an im­por­tant po­si­tion in the mar­ket land­scape of China’s im­ported beef. In July this year, China took the lead in an­nounc­ing the “lift­ing of the ban on South African beef im­ports”. As the world’s largest beef im­port mar­ket, China is wait­ing for the im­port of more South African beef prod­ucts. In re­cent years, un­der the per­sonal ef­forts of our two Lead­ers, the mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion between China and South Africa has shown a good mo­men­tum of rapid de­vel­op­ment fea­tured in an all-round, multi-field and high­level pat­tern, and is en­ter­ing the “golden time of har­vest”. Bi­lat­eral trade con­tin­ues to ex­pand. In 2018, the bi­lat­eral trade vol­ume between China and South Africa reached US$ 43.55 bil­lion against the odds, ac­count­ing for a quar­ter of the to­tal vol­ume of China-Africa trade, with an year-on-year in­crease of 11.18%, and 27 times over that of the es­tab­lish­ment of diplo­matic re­la­tions between our two coun­tries in 1998. China has been South Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner for 10 con­sec­u­tive years, and South Africa has be­come China’s largest trad­ing part­ner in Africa for nine con­sec­u­tive years. In­vest­ment model is con­tin­u­ously op­ti­mized. China’s in­vest­ment in South China started late but grew rapidly. It has de­vel­oped from sim­ply in­dus­trial di­rect in­vest­ment to new mod­els such as eq­uity swap and rel­a­tive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tions. By 2018, there have been more than 200 Chi­nese-funded en­ter­prises and in­sti­tu­tions reg­is­tered in the Em­bassy of China in South Africa, in­volv­ing in man­u­fac­tur­ing, fi­nance, min­ing, agri­cul­ture, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, com­merce and other in­dus­tries. The to­tal vol­ume of Chi­nese in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing in­put is more than 25 bil­lion US dol­lars and more than 400,000 jobs were cre­ated for the lo­cal com­mu­nity. Chi­nese en­ter­prises have made enor­mous con­tri­bu­tions to South Africa’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and so­cial sta­bil­ity in terms of in­vest­ment, tax­a­tion, em­ploy­ment and for­eign ex­change earn­ings. Ca­pac­ity build­ing has been steadily im­proved. Hu­man re­sources de­vel­op­ment and ca­pac­ity build­ing co­op­er­a­tion is an im­por­tant part of China-South Africa eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion. From 2015 to 2018, nearly 3,000 peo­ple from South Africa par­tic­i­pated in pro­fes­sional and tech­ni­cal train­ing pro­grams in China. This year, China hosted 14 bi­lat­eral train­ing pro­grams for South Africa, reach­ing a new his­tor­i­cal record both in the num­ber of pro­grams and trainees. From Jan­uary to Au­gust this year, 210 South African ap­pli­cants have trav­eled to China to par­tic­i­pate in var­i­ous pro­fes­sional train­ing pro­grams. In ad­di­tion, China wel­comes South Africa young peo­ple to par­tic­i­pate in the hun­dreds of pro­fes­sional train­ing cour­ses for the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion has been trans­formed and up­graded. China-South Africa eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion has em­barked on a de­vel­op­ment path evolv­ing from tra­di­tional trade to in­dus­trial in­vest­ment, from low-end pro­duc­tion to high-end man­u­fac­tur­ing, from eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to con­tin­u­ing up­grade of so­cial liveli­hood. In the fu­ture, China will con­tinue to in­crease its in­vest­ment in for­eign aid to South Africa un­der the framework such as Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion and Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion to help the South African gov­ern­ment im­prove peo­ple’s liveli­hood and re­duce poverty . The fourth in­dus­trial revolution is al­ready on the way. The South African gov­ern­ment has pro­posed to ac­cel­er­ate the process of in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion and dig­i­ti­za­tion in South Africa. China is com­mit­ted to com­pre­hen­sively deep­en­ing re­form and open­ing up, and pro­mot­ing eco­nomic restructuring and up­grad­ing. The de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of China and South Africa are highly com­pat­i­ble and com­ple­men­tary. The con­di­tions for achiev­ing mu­tual ben­e­fit and com­mon de­vel­op­ment are ready in place. The po­ten­tial for prag­matic co­op­er­a­tion between China and South Africa is huge. In 2018, the two Lead­ers of China and South Africa ex­changed state vis­its suc­cess­fully, and co-hosted the BRICS Lead­ers Johannesburg Sum­mit and Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion Bei­jing Sum­mit. Both sides signed agree­ments on in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing co­op­er­a­tion with a to­tal amount of US$ 19.2 bil­lion. Meet­ings between Lead­ers and Sum­mits have broad­ened the prospects for deep­en­ing mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion on trade and eco­nomics. Firstly, in­no­vat­ing new mod­els for trade growth. China will con­tinue to carry out open­ing up pol­icy. China In­ter­na­tional Im­port Expo and China-Africa Eco­nomic and Trade Expo have be­come im­por­tant plat­forms for China and South Africa to ex­pand bi­lat­eral trade. South Africa is rich in re­sources, and many of its prod­ucts and an­ti­sea­son agri­cul­ture prod­ucts are wel­comed by the Chi­nese mar­ket. With a huge con­sumer mar­ket of 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple and over 400 mil­lion mid­dle-in­come pop­u­la­tion, China is re­leas­ing a steady stream of con­sump­tion po­ten­tial. The po­ten­tial of trade co­op­er­a­tion between China and South Africa is huge, and new trade mod­els such as cross-bor­der e-com­merce of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts are ex­pected to be­come new growth points. Se­condly, rais­ing the new level of in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion. South Africa’s in­fra­struc­ture con­struc­tion is rel­a­tively ma­ture, but there is still much room for de­vel­op­ment in the fields of rail­ways, ports, power plants, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and re­gional avi­a­tion, etc. China’s equip­ment, tech­nol­ogy and Chi­nese stan­dards are of world-lead­ing level and sup­ported with strong fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. Strength­en­ing in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing co­op­er­a­tion between the two sides in in­fra­struc­ture con­struc­tion will cre­ate tens of thou­sands of jobs for South Africa and in­ject new im­pe­tus to pro­mote South Africa’s de­vel­op­ment and en­hance bi­lat­eral in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion. Thirdly, cre­at­ing new fields of eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion. China and South Africa share com­mon as­pi­ra­tion in de­vel­op­ing econ­omy and im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hood. Both sides have mu­tual needs in pro­mot­ing eco­nomic and trade, car­ry­ing out in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion, and strength­en­ing ca­pac­ity build­ing. There is broad po­ten­tial in co­op­er­a­tion on agri­cul­tural mod­ern­iza­tion, in­dus­trial dig­i­ti­za­tion, ser­vice in­dus­try in­forma­ti­za­tion, and ur­ban­iza­tion between our two coun­tries. Both sides can achieve com­mon pros­per­ity in the process of em­brac­ing the fourth in­dus­trial revolution. Deep­en­ing the mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion between China and South Africa re­quires the joint ef­forts of both sides. China’s pro­posal to pro­mote high-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will en­cour­age more qual­i­fied Chi­nese en­ter­prises to en­ter South Africa mar­ket and pro­mote mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion between our two sides. In term of ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, re­source en­dow­ments, South Africa has un­par­al­leled ad­van­tages com­par­ing with other coun­tries in Africa, and serves as a bridge­head to con­nect with China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, which can also play a role of the pro­duc­tion base to sup­port African in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion and ur­ban­iza­tion. If South Africa can im­prove the pub­lic se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tions, le­gal­ize its in­vest­ment poli­cies, sim­plify the visa pro­ce­dures to fa­cil­i­tate per­son­nel ex­changes, and im­prove the ef­fi­ciency of gov­er­nance, it will cer­tainly at­tract more Chi­nese com­pa­nies to in­vest in South Africa. This year marks the 70th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China. The Com­mu­nist Party of China is com­mit­ted to lead­ing the 1.4 bil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple to build a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects and re­al­ize the Chi­nese dream of the great re­ju­ve­na­tion of the Chi­nese na­tion, while South Africa is com­mit­ted to achiev­ing the South African dream of “hope and re­vi­tal­iza­tion”. The Chi­nese dream and the South African dream are mu­tu­ally sup­port­ive and com­ple­men­tary. Stand­ing on this new start­ing point, deep­en­ing the mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion between China and South Africa will usher in new his­tor­i­cal op­por­tu­ni­ties and thus in re­turn bring more ben­e­fits to the peo­ples of our two coun­tries.",南非
