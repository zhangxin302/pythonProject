kh,The Phnom Penh Post,20090928,Maoâ€™s China is comÂ­ing of age at last,"LONÂ­DON â€“ EvÂ­ery counÂ­try is shaped by its hisÂ­tory, but counÂ­tries fabÂ­riÂ­cate and reÂ­write their hisÂ­toÂ­ries, too. The story of how we beÂ­came who we are needs to acÂ­comÂ­moÂ­date our sense of tribal solÂ­iÂ­darÂ­ity and acÂ­comÂ­plishÂ­ment. Our triÂ­umphs and virtues are exÂ­agÂ­gerÂ­ated; our vilÂ­lains exÂ­terÂ­nalised; our failÂ­ings covÂ­ered up. All this makes the study of hisÂ­tory poÂ­tenÂ­tially inÂ­surÂ­recÂ­tionary, but hugely valuÂ­able. Good hisÂ­toÂ­riÂ­ans enÂ­courÂ­age us to be honÂ­est about ourÂ­selves. They deÂ­stroy our self-deluÂ­sions. This is esÂ­peÂ­cially true of our flawed heÂ­roes, as we see toÂ­day with the ChiÂ­nese ComÂ­muÂ­nist Partyâ€™s treatÂ­ment of Mao ZeÂ­dong. Sixty years ago this OcÂ­toÂ­ber, Mao stood on the rosÂ­trum of TiananÂ­men, the Gate of HeavÂ­enly Peace in BeiÂ­jing, and deÂ­clared the foundÂ­ing of the PeoÂ­pleâ€™s RepubÂ­lic. That moÂ­ment marked the end of years of war and terÂ­riÂ­ble hardÂ­ship; the revoÂ­luÂ­tion had been won through blood, sacÂ­riÂ­fice, heroÂ­ism, the misÂ­takes of enÂ­eÂ­mies, and the maÂ­nipÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tive asÂ­sisÂ­tance of Stalin, who purÂ­ported to be a friend. The decades of raÂ­paÂ­cious warÂ­lords, greedy imÂ­peÂ­riÂ­alÂ­ists, and JaÂ­panese inÂ­vaders were over; China could stand up â€“ though much misÂ­ery still lay ahead as Maoâ€™s tyranny put down its roots. VerÂ­dicts on Mao difÂ­fer wildly. For hard-line ComÂ­muÂ­nists, he was a hero three times over â€“ hisÂ­torÂ­iÂ­cal, paÂ­triÂ­otic, and world-class. For the brave and charisÂ­matic disÂ­siÂ­dent Wei JingÂ­sheng, Mao â€œcast virÂ­tuÂ­ally the whole of China into a state of viÂ­oÂ­lence, duÂ­plicÂ­ity, and poverty.â€ The ComÂ­muÂ­nist Partyâ€™s ofÂ­fiÂ­cial verÂ­dict, unÂ­doubtÂ­edly the prodÂ­uct of fierce ideÂ­oÂ­logÂ­iÂ­cal disÂ­putes, is that he was a great MarxÂ­ist and revÂ­oÂ­luÂ­tionÂ­ary, whose â€œgross misÂ­takesâ€ durÂ­ing the CulÂ­tural RevoÂ­luÂ­tion were outÂ­weighed by his conÂ­triÂ­buÂ­tion to Chi- na. â€œHis merÂ­its,â€ it arÂ­gues, â€œare priÂ­mary and his erÂ­rors secondary.â€ Chinaâ€™s ComÂ­muÂ­nist Party will not tolÂ­erÂ­ate any quesÂ­tionÂ­ing of this asÂ­sessÂ­ment. Maoâ€™s esÂ­tabÂ­lishÂ­ment of auÂ­thorÂ­ity over China, his inÂ­jecÂ­tion of paÂ­triÂ­otic pride into a land that had been apÂ­pallingly sunÂ­dered and huÂ­milÂ­iÂ­ated by exÂ­terÂ­nal and inÂ­terÂ­nal forces for a cenÂ­tury and a half, and his roÂ­manÂ­tic legÂ­end as a global revÂ­oÂ­luÂ­tionÂ­ary leader all conÂ­tribÂ­ute to the moral and poÂ­litÂ­iÂ­cal leÂ­gitÂ­iÂ­macy for which Chinaâ€™s leaders search. What they canÂ­not gain through demoÂ­cratic elecÂ­tions they acÂ­quire through the hisÂ­tory of the revoÂ­luÂ­tion and toÂ­dayâ€™s ecoÂ­nomic triÂ­umphs. But the dark side of Mao canÂ­not be toÂ­tally exÂ­punged. Too many peoÂ­ple reÂ­memÂ­ber what hapÂ­pened. It is an inÂ­tiÂ­mate part of their famÂ­ily stoÂ­ries. There was the Great Leap ForÂ­ward, which led to mass starÂ­vaÂ­tion and perÂ­haps as many as 38 milÂ­lion deaths. Then the madÂ­ness of the CulÂ­tural RevoÂ­luÂ­tion, when milÂ­lions sufÂ­fered terÂ­riÂ­bly, many died, and many more beÂ­haved disÂ­graceÂ­fully as Mao sought to deÂ­stroy those who had resÂ­cued China from his earÂ­lier folÂ­lies. Jung Changâ€™s faÂ­mous biÂ­ogÂ­raÂ­phy of Mao, pubÂ­lished in 2005, reÂ­counts those awÂ­ful events in the sort of bleak deÂ­tail that makes ComÂ­muÂ­nist proÂ­paÂ­ganÂ­dists nerÂ­vous â€“ and some acaÂ­demic siÂ­nolÂ­oÂ­gists critÂ­iÂ­cal that Maoâ€™s achieveÂ­ments go too litÂ­tle recogÂ­nised. Mao is cerÂ­tainly a more inÂ­terÂ­estÂ­ing figÂ­ure than were many tyrants â€“ a poet, an inÂ­telÂ­lecÂ­tual, a stuÂ­dent of hisÂ­tory as well as a seÂ­rial phiÂ­lanÂ­derer, who, acÂ­cordÂ­ing to his docÂ­tor, Li Zhisui, liked to swim in waÂ­ter, not bathe in it. I know of no betÂ­ter, more fasÂ­ciÂ­natÂ­ing â€œwarts and allâ€ porÂ­trait of any poÂ­litÂ­iÂ­cal leader than Liâ€™s book, The PriÂ­vate Life of ChairÂ­man Mao. I reÂ­memÂ­ber beÂ­ing told a story about China that gives creÂ­dence to the ComÂ­muÂ­nist leadÂ­erÂ­shipâ€™s genÂ­erÂ­ous verÂ­dict on Mao. The mother of a ChiÂ­nese jourÂ­nalÂ­ist (now livÂ­ing outÂ­side the counÂ­try) had been one of those who reÂ­turned afÂ­ter 1949 to her homeÂ­land with her husÂ­band and famÂ­ily from a comfortable life at an AmerÂ­iÂ­can uniÂ­verÂ­sity. They reÂ­garded reÂ­turnÂ­ing as their paÂ­triÂ­otic duty. The famÂ­ily sacÂ­riÂ­ficed evÂ­eryÂ­thing. They were hit by round afÂ­ter round of Maoâ€™s tyranÂ­niÂ­cal camÂ­paigns against â€œRightÂ­ists,â€ beginning with the siÂ­lencÂ­ing of critÂ­ics afÂ­ter the Hun- dred FlowÂ­ers MoveÂ­ment in 1956. The famÂ­ily lived in penury. The faÂ­ther died from ill-treatÂ­ment durÂ­ing the CulÂ­tural RevoÂ­luÂ­tion. But the mother never comÂ­plained. She beÂ­lieved that her famÂ­ilyâ€™s sacÂ­riÂ­fices were jusÂ­tiÂ­fied by the libÂ­erÂ­aÂ­tion and rise of China. ToÂ­wards the end of her life, this mood changed. She saw in the 1990s the beginning of Chinaâ€™s ecoÂ­nomic asÂ­cent â€“ the early years of specÂ­tacÂ­uÂ­lar growth. She wit- nessed the reÂ­turn of the greed and corÂ­rupÂ­tion that she beÂ­lieved had deÂ­stroyed the KuomÂ­intang in the 1930s and 1940s. Why, she asked herÂ­self, had her famÂ­ily sufÂ­fered so much if it was only to preÂ­pare the way for this? Yet it is Chinaâ€™s ecoÂ­nomic reÂ­naisÂ­sance â€“ some of whose efÂ­fects so disÂ­turbed this paÂ­triÂ­otic old woman â€“ which has been the most reÂ­markÂ­able event in reÂ­cent world hisÂ­tory. The ecoÂ­nomic turnÂ­around beÂ­gan unÂ­der the leadÂ­erÂ­ship of Deng XiaopÂ­ing, who had surÂ­vived Maoâ€™s purges to folÂ­low in his footÂ­steps and beÂ­come the arÂ­chiÂ­tect of Chinaâ€™s rise as a world power. The hunÂ­dreds of milÂ­lions of ChiÂ­nese who have been lifted out of poverty as a reÂ­sult of Dengâ€™s reÂ­forms will in time reÂ­gard him as a greater hero than Mao. But, whatÂ­ever Maoâ€™s terÂ­riÂ­ble failÂ­ings, durÂ­ing his years of abÂ­soÂ­lute power there was a sense of comÂ­mon purÂ­pose and solÂ­iÂ­darÂ­ity that went with shared hardÂ­ship. MaoÂ­ism was a cuÂ­riÂ­ous and unique mixÂ­ture of class warÂ­fare and soÂ­cialÂ­ist levÂ­elÂ­ing, all enunÂ­ciÂ­ated by a man who beÂ­lieved that inÂ­diÂ­vidÂ­uÂ­als â€“ or at least Mao himÂ­self â€“ could shape hisÂ­tory rather than be formed by its tides and curÂ­rents. This creed has clearly not surÂ­vived its creÂ­ator. PragÂ­maÂ­tism with a LeninÂ­ist face is the orÂ­der of the day. The gloÂ­ries of getÂ­ting rich have overÂ­whelmed the deÂ­priÂ­vaÂ­tions of paÂ­triÂ­otic self-sacÂ­riÂ­fice. Mao made China proud. Deng made it prosÂ­perÂ­ous. What hapÂ­pens next? For all our sakes, I hope that the fuÂ­ture does not deÂ­rail Chinaâ€™s ecoÂ­nomic progress, though it will be a surÂ­prise if it does not chalÂ­lenge its arthritic and adamanÂ­tine poÂ­litÂ­iÂ­cal sysÂ­tem."
kh,The Phnom Penh Post,20210224,More women hold top spots in PhilipÂ­pine firms,"ALÂ­MOST half of seÂ­nior leadÂ­erÂ­ship poÂ­siÂ­tions in mid-marÂ­ket busiÂ­nesses in the PhilipÂ­pines are now held by women, the highÂ­est proÂ­porÂ­tion among the 29 large economies surÂ­veyed anÂ­nuÂ­ally by global conÂ­sulÂ­tancy firm Grant ThornÂ­ton. More imÂ­porÂ­tantly, the 48 per cent of seÂ­nior corÂ­poÂ­rate poÂ­siÂ­tions held by feÂ­males in the counÂ­try is higher than last yearâ€™s level of 43 per cent, and repÂ­reÂ­sents a marked imÂ­proveÂ­ment over the 35 per cent recorded in the Women in BusiÂ­ness reÂ­port a decade ago. P&A Grant ThornÂ­ton chair and CEO Marivic EsÂ­pano said in a stateÂ­ment: â€œRankÂ­ing first globÂ­ally in terms of women in seÂ­nior roles in the PhilipÂ­pines is an imÂ­porÂ­tant mileÂ­stone for busiÂ­nesses in the counÂ­try, but not the end goal.â€ The inÂ­crease in the raÂ­tio of women holdÂ­ing seÂ­nior poÂ­siÂ­tions in loÂ­cal firms repÂ­reÂ­sents a steady imÂ­proveÂ­ment for the counÂ­try in reÂ­cent years. It also passes the imÂ­porÂ­tant 30 per cent threshÂ­old, which reÂ­search shows is the minÂ­iÂ­mum repÂ­reÂ­senÂ­taÂ­tion needed to change deÂ­ciÂ­sion-makÂ­ing proÂ­cesses. All counÂ­tries surÂ­veyed exÂ­cept for China (29 per cent), the UAE (26 per cent), South Korea (18 per cent) and JaÂ­pan (15 per cent) have now surÂ­passed the cruÂ­cial 30 per cent mileÂ­stone. Grant ThornÂ­tonâ€™s reÂ­search reÂ­vealed higher numÂ­bers of women across opÂ­erÂ­aÂ­tional â€œCsuiteâ€ roles in the PhilipÂ­pines comÂ­pared to last year, with the proÂ­porÂ­tion of feÂ­male CEO up 16 perÂ­centÂ­age points to 38 per cent, and feÂ­male chief opÂ­erÂ­atÂ­ing ofÂ­fiÂ­cers up four perÂ­centÂ­age points to 27 per cent. On the other hand, this year, the proÂ­porÂ­tion of feÂ­male chief fiÂ­nanÂ­cial ofÂ­fiÂ­cers went down three perÂ­centÂ­age points to 35 per cent. The proÂ­porÂ­tion of women in the more traÂ­diÂ­tional seÂ­nior huÂ­man reÂ­sources roles was also up at 48 per cent, higher by 12 perÂ­centÂ­age points in 2021. The data was conÂ­tained in Grant ThornÂ­tonâ€™s InÂ­terÂ­naÂ­tional BusiÂ­ness ReÂ­port, a surÂ­vey of both listed and priÂ­vately held busiÂ­nesses. Launched in 1992, the reÂ­port now proÂ­vides inÂ­sight into the views and exÂ­pecÂ­taÂ­tions of around 10,000 busiÂ­nesses across 29 economies. QuesÂ­tionÂ­naires are transÂ­lated into loÂ­cal lanÂ­guages and fieldÂ­work is unÂ­derÂ­taken on a bianÂ­nual baÂ­sis, through both onÂ­line and teleÂ­phone inÂ­terÂ­views. The data for this reÂ­lease are from inÂ­terÂ­views conÂ­ducted from OcÂ­toÂ­ber-DeÂ­cemÂ­ber last year with CEO, manÂ­agÂ­ing diÂ­recÂ­tors, chairÂ­perÂ­son or other seÂ­nior exÂ­ecÂ­uÂ­tives from all inÂ­dusÂ­try secÂ­tors. In the PhilipÂ­pines, 100 mid-marÂ­ket busiÂ­nesses were surÂ­veyed. THOUÂ­SANDS marched in AlÂ­geÂ­riaâ€™s capÂ­iÂ­tal and other cities on FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 22 to mark the secÂ­ond anÂ­niverÂ­sary of the â€œHiÂ­rakâ€ protest moveÂ­ment that forced long-time presÂ­iÂ­dent AbÂ­deÂ­laziz BouteÂ­flika from power. â€œWe are not here to celÂ­eÂ­brate, but to deÂ­mand your deÂ­parÂ­ture,â€ proÂ­testÂ­ers shouted, reÂ­ferÂ­ring to a governÂ­ment they see as litÂ­tle difÂ­ferÂ­ent from the one BouteÂ­flika headed for two decades. FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 22â€™s mass rally in AlÂ­giers was the largest since weekly â€˜HiÂ­rakâ€™ demonÂ­straÂ­tions were susÂ­pended in March last year in reÂ­sponse to the Covid-19 panÂ­demic. PoÂ­lice were deÂ­ployed in force in the capÂ­iÂ­tal, where they set up seÂ­cuÂ­rity checkÂ­points and carÂ­ried out idenÂ­tity checks around key flashÂ­points while heÂ­liÂ­copters hovÂ­ered overÂ­head. At least 59 peoÂ­ple were arÂ­rested across the North African counÂ­try, inÂ­cludÂ­ing 26 in AlÂ­giers, acÂ­cordÂ­ing to the CNLD prisonÂ­ersâ€™ rights group and AFP jourÂ­nalÂ­ists. â€œThe fateÂ­ful hour has arÂ­rived,â€ read one banÂ­ner branÂ­dished by demonÂ­straÂ­tors, while othÂ­ers waved AlÂ­geÂ­rian and BerÂ­ber flags. PoÂ­lice tried to block proÂ­testÂ­ers from gathÂ­erÂ­ing around the Grand Post OfÂ­fice, which was at the heart of the mass protests that kicked off in AlÂ­giers and sevÂ­eral other cities on FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 22, 2019, to opÂ­pose BouteÂ­flikaâ€™s bid for a fifth term. OutÂ­side the capÂ­iÂ­tal, marches were also beÂ­ing held in Annaba, Oran, Setif and MostaÂ­ganem, acÂ­cordÂ­ing to witÂ­nesses and soÂ­cial meÂ­dia acÂ­counts. The protest in AlÂ­giers ended peaceÂ­fully in the afÂ­terÂ­noon, with stuÂ­dents who took part in the deÂ­monÂ­straÂ­tion pledgÂ­ing to reÂ­sume their weekly TuesÂ­day ralÂ­lies. ApÂ­peaseÂ­ment gesÂ­ture DemonÂ­straÂ­tors kept up their protests afÂ­ter BouteÂ­flikaâ€™s resÂ­igÂ­naÂ­tion, deÂ­mandÂ­ing a sweepÂ­ing overÂ­haul of a rulÂ­ing sysÂ­tem in place since AlÂ­geÂ­riaâ€™s inÂ­deÂ­penÂ­dence from France in 1962. They only susÂ­pended marches last March due to coroÂ­nÂ­avirus reÂ­stricÂ­tions, but calls have reÂ­cently cirÂ­cuÂ­lated on soÂ­cial meÂ­dia for a reÂ­turn to the streets. On the eve of the anÂ­niverÂ­sary, PresÂ­iÂ­dent AbÂ­delÂ­madÂ­jid TebÂ­boune â€“ elected in DeÂ­cemÂ­ber 2019 on a very low turnout in a poll boyÂ­cotted by the protest moveÂ­ment â€“ anÂ­nounced a limited governÂ­ment reshufÂ­fle, in a bid to head off reÂ­newed ralÂ­lies. The reshufÂ­fle saw few maÂ­jor changes by TebÂ­boune, who was once a prime minÂ­isÂ­ter unÂ­der BouteÂ­flika. Among those reÂ­tained are Prime MinÂ­isÂ­ter AbÂ­deÂ­laziz Djerad and jusÂ­tice minÂ­isÂ­ter BelkaÂ­cem ZeghÂ­mati, who is seen as a symÂ­bol of AlÂ­geÂ­riaâ€™s juÂ­diÂ­cial crackÂ­down on proÂ­testÂ­ers and opÂ­poÂ­siÂ­tion acÂ­tivists. TebÂ­boune also signed a deÂ­cree disÂ­solvÂ­ing parÂ­liaÂ­ment, clearing the way for early elecÂ­tions, but no date has yet been set. In a gesÂ­ture of apÂ­peaseÂ­ment on FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 18, he anÂ­nounced parÂ­dons that have led so far to the reÂ­lease of alÂ­most 40 pro-democÂ­racy acÂ­tivists, inÂ­cludÂ­ing opÂ­poÂ­siÂ­tion figÂ­ure Rachid Nekkaz and jourÂ­nalÂ­ist Khaled Drareni, who has beÂ­come a symÂ­bol of the strugÂ­gle for a free press. â€˜Same old peoÂ­pleâ€™ Zaki HanÂ­nache, a 33-year-old acÂ­tivist, said â€˜HiÂ­rakâ€™ supÂ­portÂ­ers were unimÂ­pressed by the presÂ­iÂ­dentâ€™s reshufÂ­fle and his call for early legÂ­islaÂ­tive polls. â€œThe reshufÂ­fle doesnâ€™t inÂ­terÂ­est me, itâ€™s the same old peoÂ­ple,â€ he said. â€œSame thing with parÂ­liaÂ­ment, the new ones [deputies] will work, like the curÂ­rent regime, for their own inÂ­terÂ­ests, not for the peoÂ­ple.â€ Amnesty InÂ­terÂ­naÂ­tional on FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 22 acÂ­cused the auÂ­thorÂ­iÂ­ties of a coÂ­orÂ­diÂ­nated stratÂ­egy to siÂ­lence critÂ­ics, based on an inÂ­vesÂ­tiÂ­gaÂ­tion it carÂ­ried out on the cases of 73 acÂ­tivists who were â€œarÂ­biÂ­trarÂ­ily arÂ­restedâ€ and prosÂ­eÂ­cuted. Our â€œfindÂ­ings are evÂ­iÂ­dence of a deÂ­libÂ­erÂ­ate stratÂ­egy to crush disÂ­sent . . . that give the lie to the auÂ­thorÂ­iÂ­tiesâ€™ promÂ­ises of upÂ­holdÂ­ing huÂ­man rightsâ€, said Amna GuelÂ­lali, the rights groupâ€™s deputy diÂ­recÂ­tor for the MidÂ­dle East and North Africa. Many of those given presÂ­iÂ­denÂ­tial parÂ­dons in reÂ­cent days â€œwere peaceÂ­ful acÂ­tivists who . . . should never have been deÂ­tained in the first placeâ€, she said. On FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 16, thouÂ­sands of AlÂ­geÂ­riÂ­ans ralÂ­lied in the northÂ­ern town of KherÂ­rata, where the first maÂ­jor protest erupted in 2019 against BouteÂ­flikaâ€™s regime. THE PhilipÂ­pinesâ€™ drug regÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tor gave emerÂ­gency apÂ­proval FeÂ­bruÂ­ary 22 to the ChiÂ­neÂ­seÂ­made SiÂ­noÂ­vac coroÂ­nÂ­avirus vacÂ­cine, with the first doses set to arÂ­rive this week â€“ but health workÂ­ers will not get the jab due to its comÂ­parÂ­aÂ­tively low efÂ­fiÂ­cacy. CoronÂ­aVac is the third vacÂ­cine apÂ­proved for emerÂ­gency use in the counÂ­try, but so far none have been deÂ­livÂ­ered and PresÂ­iÂ­dent RoÂ­drigo Duterteâ€™s governÂ­ment is unÂ­der fire over the deÂ­layed rollÂ­out. BeiÂ­jing has agreed to donate 600,000 doses, which will arÂ­rive in the next three to five days, ofÂ­fiÂ­cials said â€“ deÂ­spite misÂ­givÂ­ings over its safety and efÂ­fecÂ­tiveÂ­ness. Food and Drug AdÂ­minÂ­isÂ­traÂ­tion head Eric Domingo said: â€œIt is deÂ­cided . . . that the benÂ­eÂ­fit of usÂ­ing the vacÂ­cine outÂ­weighs the known and poÂ­tenÂ­tial risks.â€ The CoronÂ­aVac can be given to â€œclinÂ­iÂ­cally healthyâ€ adults aged 18 to 59, but was not recÂ­omÂ­mended for frontÂ­line health workÂ­ers or the elÂ­derly, he said. PresÂ­iÂ­denÂ­tial Harry Roque spokesman said workÂ­ers conÂ­sidÂ­ered esÂ­senÂ­tial to the econÂ­omy and solÂ­diers were likely to reÂ­ceive the first jabs. AlÂ­though triÂ­als in Turkey found CoronÂ­aVac to be 91.25 per cent efÂ­fecÂ­tive, other, more roÂ­bust triÂ­als in Brazil only demonÂ­strated an efÂ­fiÂ­cacy rate of around 50 per cent. Roque deÂ­fended the push to use the SiÂ­noÂ­vac vacÂ­cine, sayÂ­ing â€œitâ€™s betÂ­ter than not havÂ­ing proÂ­tecÂ­tion at allâ€. Many world leadÂ­ers have been among the first in their counÂ­tries to reÂ­ceive jabs to boost pubÂ­lic conÂ­fiÂ­dence. But Duterte preÂ­ferred to wait for a difÂ­ferÂ­ent ChiÂ­nese vacÂ­cine made by state-owned Sinopharm, Roque said, citÂ­ing the presÂ­iÂ­dentâ€™s old age. The Sinopharm vacÂ­cine was seÂ­cretly given to memÂ­bers of Duterteâ€™s seÂ­cuÂ­rity team last year even though it had not been apÂ­proved for use. ApÂ­peal for paÂ­tience The governÂ­ment is in talks with seven vacÂ­cine makÂ­ers, inÂ­cludÂ­ing SiÂ­noÂ­vac, in the hope of seÂ­curÂ­ing enough doses to inÂ­ocÂ­uÂ­late 70 milÂ­lion peoÂ­ple â€“ about 60 per cent of the popÂ­uÂ­laÂ­tion â€“ this year. But the lack of transÂ­parency and deÂ­lays in deÂ­livÂ­ery of the first doses have fuÂ­elled critÂ­iÂ­cism of the governÂ­ment over its hanÂ­dling of the health criÂ­sis. More than 560,000 cases of coroÂ­nÂ­avirus have been recorded in the counÂ­try, inÂ­cludÂ­ing over 12,000 deaths. SoÂ­cial disÂ­tancÂ­ing rules and travel reÂ­stricÂ­tions have cripÂ­pled the econÂ­omy. CarÂ­lÂ­ito Galvez, a reÂ­tired genÂ­eral overÂ­seeÂ­ing vacÂ­cine proÂ­cureÂ­ment, reÂ­cently adÂ­mitÂ­ted the governÂ­ment had not yet signed any supÂ­ply agreeÂ­ments, only non-bindÂ­ing â€œterm sheetsâ€ for poÂ­tenÂ­tial deals. More than 100,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vacÂ­cine were supÂ­posed to be deÂ­livÂ­ered mid-FeÂ­bruÂ­ary through the CoÂ­vax global vacÂ­ciÂ­naÂ­tion proÂ­gramme. But Galvez said the deÂ­livÂ­ery had been held up over inÂ­demÂ­niÂ­fiÂ­caÂ­tion agreeÂ­ments that would proÂ­tect the vacÂ­cine makÂ­ers from leÂ­gal claims over any side efÂ­fects. IN A snowÂ­storm on the VisÂ­tula River laÂ­goon near Polandâ€™s Baltic coast, a speÂ­cial harÂ­vester is cutÂ­ting down reeds desÂ­tined for exÂ­port across Europe for use in traÂ­diÂ­tional and susÂ­tainÂ­able thatched roofs. â€œWeâ€™ve been makÂ­ing reed roofs since the dawn of time,â€ said Ryszard ZaÂ­galÂ­ski, owner of a reed farm in the northÂ­ern vilÂ­lage of Jagodno, near the city of Elblag. â€œWherÂ­ever there were waÂ­terÂ­ways and fields of reeds, the reeds were used to cover roofs beÂ­cause they make for very good inÂ­suÂ­laÂ­tion: high qualÂ­ity and cheap,â€ he said. â€œBut for years now, they have been someÂ­what forÂ­gotÂ­ten as a roofÂ­ing maÂ­teÂ­rial â€“ wrongly equated with poverty. The job of a reed roofer has pracÂ­tiÂ­cally disÂ­apÂ­peared since the 1950s.â€ Yet not only do reeds make for good natÂ­uÂ­ral inÂ­suÂ­laÂ­tion, they are also very durable. â€œI have seen alÂ­most cenÂ­turies-old reeds used in roofs in SweÂ­den. If you are usÂ­ing reeds the right way, in norÂ­mal cirÂ­cumÂ­stances the roof should last more than 50 years as long as it is mainÂ­tained regÂ­uÂ­larly,â€ ZaÂ­galÂ­ski said. BeÂ­fore the reeds can be used on roofs, they have to be a year old, straight and thin. It takes three peoÂ­ple to work the harÂ­vester, which covÂ­ers many kiloÂ­meÂ­tres on the banks of the VisÂ­tula River laÂ­goon. One worker drives, anÂ­other colÂ­lects the readyÂ­made bunÂ­dles while a third loads them. Once at the wareÂ­house, the reeds are sorted and quickly sent to clients. BiodegradÂ­able Like other secÂ­tors, the reed inÂ­dusÂ­try has seen conÂ­sidÂ­erÂ­able comÂ­peÂ­tiÂ­tion from China. â€œThere was a time when ChiÂ­nese reeds took over and deÂ­stroyed the EuroÂ­pean marÂ­ket,â€ ZaÂ­galÂ­ski said. â€œSome of my colÂ­leagues were not able to withÂ­stand the comÂ­peÂ­tiÂ­tion.â€ ToÂ­day, there are up to 10 reed farms in Poland. Most of the prodÂ­uct ends up abroad. ZaÂ­galÂ­ski exÂ­ports his reeds to GerÂ­many, the NetherÂ­lands, DenÂ­mark, SweÂ­den. In adÂ­diÂ­tion to their longevity, they are also 100 per cent ecofriendly and biodegradÂ­able. â€œWhen the time comes to reÂ­move the reeds from the roof, all you have to do is take them to a field, bury them in the ground, and they are reÂ­cyÂ­cled,â€ ZaÂ­galÂ­ski said. â€œI donâ€™t think anyÂ­one has yet thought up a way of reÂ­cyÂ­cling the maÂ­teÂ­riÂ­als that we use in the magÂ­nifÂ­iÂ­cent roofs that we make toÂ­day, and that will defÂ­iÂ­nitely cause maÂ­jor isÂ­sues.â€"
kh,The Phnom Penh Post,20181218,MarÂ­riage just a click away for Chinaâ€™s bachÂ­eÂ­lors,"MARÂ­RIAGE to a VietÂ­namese bride is just a click â€“ and a few thouÂ­sand dolÂ­lars â€“ away on a blÂ­izÂ­zard of ChiÂ­nese webÂ­sites promisÂ­ing to solve the â€œsinÂ­gle probÂ­lemsâ€ of Chinaâ€™s men. A decades-long one-child polÂ­icy has creÂ­ated a yawnÂ­ing deÂ­moÂ­graphic disÂ­parÂ­ity in China, with tens of milÂ­lions more men than women. Sites like Zhongyuelove.com make their marÂ­gin plugÂ­ging that gap, linkÂ­ing lovelorn ChiÂ­nese men with VietÂ­namese women, pressed by poverty at home to marry thouÂ­sands of kiloÂ­meÂ­tres away. â€œVietÂ­namese women are a blessÂ­ing for this group [unÂ­marÂ­ried ChiÂ­nese men],â€ the webÂ­site says, usÂ­ing an imÂ­age gallery of women in their early 20s backed up by poÂ­etic words on the prospecÂ­tive brides to seize the inÂ­terÂ­est of Chinaâ€™s bachÂ­eÂ­lors. â€œThey [the women] are pure, beauÂ­tiÂ­ful, traÂ­diÂ­tional,â€ it says â€œand posÂ­sess the genÂ­tleÂ­ness and virtue of ChiÂ­nese women but also the roÂ­manÂ­tic exÂ­otiÂ­cism of a forÂ­eign bride.â€ Its matchÂ­makÂ­ing fee for conÂ­nectÂ­ing bachÂ­eÂ­lors is around $4,000 â€“ which inÂ­cludes non-reÂ­fundÂ­able â€˜blind datesâ€™, an unÂ­specÂ­iÂ­fied â€˜pre-marÂ­iÂ­tal medÂ­iÂ­cal examâ€™ and wedÂ­ding phoÂ­togÂ­raÂ­phy if all goes well. The fee does not cover wedÂ­ding gifts to the brideâ€™s famÂ­ily or transÂ­portaÂ­tion fees for the bride and groom. For those conÂ­cerned by the posÂ­siÂ­bilÂ­ity of failed marÂ­riages and the shady broÂ­kerÂ­ing sysÂ­tem that atÂ­tracts conÂ­men on both sides of the borÂ­der, Zhongyuelove has an â€˜FAQâ€™ secÂ­tion. It ofÂ­fers reÂ­asÂ­surÂ­ance on the visa process for a forÂ­eign bride and warns would-be grooms to be up front about their inÂ­come, livÂ­ing sitÂ­uÂ­aÂ­tion and any disÂ­abilÂ­iÂ­ties. The â€˜senÂ­siÂ­tive questionsâ€™ tab delves deeper with blunt queries about the beauty and ethics of VietÂ­namese women as well as disÂ­cusÂ­sions over the likeÂ­liÂ­hood of them runÂ­ning away afÂ­ter the marÂ­riage â€“ and the fees have been paid. MatchÂ­makÂ­ing is comÂ­mon inÂ­side China, but the overÂ­seas bride busiÂ­ness has exÂ­ploded in reÂ­cent years with men fearÂ­ing a lifeÂ­time of sinÂ­gleÂ­dom while â€˜bride pricesâ€™ â€“ dowries â€“ for ChiÂ­nese women rise sharply. There are no ofÂ­fiÂ­cial figÂ­ures but exÂ­perts beÂ­lieve tens of thouÂ­sands of women from MyanÂ­mar, Laos,VietÂ­nam and CamÂ­boÂ­dia pour into China each year for marÂ­riage. Many go willÂ­ingly, conÂ­nected via webÂ­sites and inÂ­forÂ­mal, ilÂ­leÂ­gal netÂ­works of broÂ­kers on both sides of the borÂ­der. OthÂ­ers are tricked to move for work, kidÂ­napped and forced into marÂ­riage. WebÂ­sites like www.0084520.com ofÂ­fer and ranks the would-be brides for â€˜popÂ­uÂ­larÂ­ityâ€™ while runÂ­ning a photo ticker of happy marÂ­riage cerÂ­eÂ­monies, comÂ­plete with VietÂ­namese conÂ­iÂ­cal hats and Ao Dai tuÂ­nics, bouÂ­quets of flowÂ­ers, smiles and alÂ­coÂ­hol."

The 50,000sqm reÂ­tail mall with five floors fiÂ­nally opened last ThursÂ­day and is home to many chain brands. Prince Huan You CEO Zhang Rui Jun said called it the first mixed-use shopÂ­ping cenÂ­ter in Preah SiÂ­hanouk provÂ­ince and a reÂ­sponse to the govÂ­ernÂ­mentâ€™s recÂ­tanÂ­guÂ­lar stratÂ­egy. He said: â€œThe soft launch has reÂ­ceived supÂ­port and atÂ­tenÂ­tion from the adÂ­minÂ­isÂ­traÂ­tion of Preah SiÂ­hanouk provÂ­ince and relÂ­eÂ­vant inÂ­stiÂ­tuÂ­tions.

The Preah SiÂ­hanouk ProÂ­vinÂ­cial AdÂ­minÂ­isÂ­traÂ­tion signed a MemÂ­oÂ­ranÂ­dum of UnÂ­derÂ­standÂ­ing (MoU) with 16 ChiÂ­nese cities and provÂ­inces in June to proÂ­mote inÂ­vestÂ­ments in tourism, culÂ­ture, education and sports. The numÂ­ber of ChiÂ­nese visÂ­itÂ­ing Preah SiÂ­hanouk has dropped due to Covid-19 and a ban on onÂ­line gamÂ­bling that took efÂ­fect in JanÂ­uary. There are about 15,000 reÂ­mainÂ­ing in coastal provÂ­inces comÂ­pared to two milÂ­lion just a year ago. ProÂ­vinÂ­cial govÂ­erÂ­nor Kuoch ChamÂ­roeun said the provÂ­ince has atÂ­tracted nearly $4 bilÂ­lion in inÂ­vestÂ­ment since 1994. He said comÂ­paÂ­nies have deÂ­velÂ­oped 11,637ha of beaches and isÂ­lands, with a toÂ­tal capÂ­iÂ­tal inÂ­vestÂ­ment of $3.9 bilÂ­lion. He said more than 60 comÂ­paÂ­nies plan to inÂ­vest a toÂ­tal of $10.74 bilÂ­lion in tourism and hoÂ­tels. The tourism secÂ­tor has genÂ­erÂ­ated more than 10,000 jobs this year on avÂ­erÂ­age."
