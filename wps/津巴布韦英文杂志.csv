zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20210404,AfCTA an op­por­tu­nity for Africa-China,"AFRICA and China have an “un­prece­dented” op­por­tu­nity for col­lab­o­ra­tion through the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agree­ment, the AfCFTA chief has told Xin­hua. Call­ing China “a strong part­ner to Africa,” sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the AfCFTA sec­re­tariat Wamkele Mene said that China has pro­vided Africa with “sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment sup­port and in­vest­ment sup­port” over the past decade. “We are now in a po­si­tion to of­fer China, as a part­ner, an in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion that is based on the free trade area,” he noted, adding that the scope for co­op­er­a­tion could be in in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, man­u­fac­tur­ing and the ser­vices sec­tor. “This AfCFTA pro­vides the frame­work for us to con­tinue that col­lab­o­ra­tion with China,”said Mene, adding that with the es­tab­lish­ment of the AfCFTA frame­work, Africa has“over­come the mar­ket frag­men­ta­tion that was there be­fore.” “If you are an in­vestor, you have now a seam­less mar­ket of 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple,” he said.

Data from the World Bank shows that the trade bloc will cre­ate a col­lec­tive gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of US$ 3,4 tril­lion and has a po­ten­tial of lift­ing up to 30 mil­lion Africans out of ex­treme poverty. Talk­ing about the im­pact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mene said that the virus has had a neg­a­tive im­pact on Africa’s econ­omy. “In gen­eral, our ex­port ca­pac­ity re­duced by up to 35 per­cent just this year alone,” he said. The ser­vices sec­tor, which con­trib­utes sig­nif­i­cantly to Africa’s com­bined GDP, ex­pe­ri­enced sig­nif­i­cant losses, he said. “Forty-two out of 55 coun­tries last year were ei­ther in a full or par­tial lock­down, which meant that there were no goods that were trans­mit­ting through borders.” — Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210421,Peace and se­cu­rity in Africa: How China can help ad­dress weak­nesses,"AFRICAN lead­ers have com­mit­ted them­selves to end­ing armed con­flict on the con­ti­nent and pro­mot­ing last­ing peace and eco­nomic pros­per­ity. This is in keep­ing with the African Union’s blue­print for the con­ti­nent. Sadly, though, the lead­ers’ 2013 pledge to “si­lence the guns” by 2020 has not been hon­oured. Bloody con­flicts con­tinue to rage in many parts of Africa. This in­cludes in the Lake Chad Basin, Cabo Del­gado prov­ince of Mozam­bique, Gulf of Guinea, So­ma­lia and the Tigray prov­ince of Ethiopia. Con­flict im­pedes the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Ac­cord­ing to a 2017 re­port by Rwan­dan Pres­i­dent Paul Kagame, then chair­man of the African Union (AU), the fail­ure to end con­flict shows that mem­ber States do not take AU’s de­ci­sions se­ri­ously. This gives the con­ti­nen­tal body lit­tle cred­i­bil­ity. Very lit­tle has changed since Kagame’s re­port. The in­ad­e­quate re­sponse to se­cu­rity crises con­tin­ues. This is be­cause most of the 55-mem­ber States lack the ca­pac­ity to carry out its man­date. There is also a lack of po­lit­i­cal will to im­ple­ment AU’s peace and se­cu­rity pro­grammes. The em­pha­sis, in­stead, is on re­spect­ing the sovereignty of the States. The African peace and se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture The on­go­ing con­flicts in­di­cate that AU’s peace and se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture is fail­ing to pre­vent or man­age con­flict and build peace — de­spite some progress. The fail­ures ex­tend to the body’s eight re­gional eco­nomic com­mu­ni­ties. The ar­chi­tec­ture con­sists of the Peace and Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, sup­ported by the AU com­mis­sion, panel of the wise, the con­ti­nen­tal early warn­ing sys­tem, African standby force and the Africa peace fund. The main rea­son for the fail­ure of the peace and se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture is or­gan­i­sa­tional dys­func­tion. This re­sults in an “in­ef­fec­tive re­sponse to se­cu­rity crises”. My on­go­ing re­search into a new par­a­digm for peace and se­cu­rity in Africa ex­am­ines how China can help ad­dress this weak­ness. China’s con­tri­bu­tion to peace and se­cu­rity in Africa China is al­ready con­tribut­ing to the peace and se­cu­rity ob­jec­tives of the AU through ca­pac­ity build­ing for so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and ed­u­ca­tion for so­cial trans­for­ma­tion. It also con­trib­utes to peace mis­sions in Africa. China, us­ing the ex­ten­sive mil­i­tary knowl­edge of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army, can en­hance the AU’s mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion ca­pac­ity. This is es­pe­cially so with re­gards to the non-com­bat­ant de­vel­op­men­tal ap­proach to post­civil war peace-build­ing, in­clud­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion pro­grammes. Chi­nese mil­i­tary as­sis­tance to Africa is shaped by the China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion Bei­jing Ac­tion Plan (2019-21). The plan in­cludes as­sis­tance for mil­i­tary, po­lice and counter ter­ror­ism ac­tiv­i­ties. It also caters for the devel­op­ing the African standby force. The force is sup­posed to en­able the AU to in­ter­vene in “grave cir­cum­stances” such as geno­cide. Mil­i­tary co-op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa takes the form of in­tel­li­gence ex­change, mil­i­tary per­son­nel train­ing, com­mer­cial arms sales, and reg­u­lar peace and se­cu­rity fo­rums. China also pro­vides law en­force­ment train­ing. Spe­cific mil­i­tary aid in­cludes sup­port to coun­tries in the Sa­hel re­gion, the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Guinea and the Horn of Africa. China’s de­vel­op­ment model The “Chi­nese model” for de­vel­op­ment could be a blue­print for mod­erni­sa­tion and trans­for­ma­tion of African economies. The model in­cludes “go­ing global” to find mul­ti­lat­eral so­lu­tions to re­duce costs and share the bur­den of de­vel­op­ment. China’s new strat­egy for Africa is to build its soft power. Peace mis­sions, cul­tural ex­changes, ed­u­ca­tional projects and fi­nanc­ing ed­u­ca­tional in­fra­struc­ture in Africa are in­te­gral to this strat­egy. The strat­egy serves China’s own in­ter­ests. The cre­ation of se­cure in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ments ben­e­fit its econ­omy. This, while pro­mot­ing trans­par­ent, ac­count­able and rule-based gov­er­nance in Africa. China is heav­ily in­vested in Africa. In 2020, de­spite a chal­leng­ing global mar­ket, trade be­tween China and Africa was nearly US$180 bil­lion. Al­though less than the US$208,7 bil­lion of 2019, China has been Africa’s biggest trad­ing part­ner for the last 12 years. Mul­ti­lat­eral plat­forms On a mul­ti­lat­eral level, China’s se­cu­rity co-op­er­a­tion with Africa was boosted by the first China-Africa de­fence and se­cu­rity fo­rum of June 2018. It fo­cuse on peace­keep­ing and peace-build­ing mis­sions. China is build­ing the ca­pac­ity of the armed forces of sev­eral African States as part of bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral ar­range­ments. It main­tains strong bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with South Africa and Rwanda, for ex­am­ple. It also has strate­gic ties with sev­eral coun­tries in North Africa. China’s cur­rent peace and se­cu­rity ac­tiv­i­ties in­di­cate a de­par­ture from its erst­while pol­icy of non-in­ter­fer­ence, to one that en­tails post con­flict peace-build­ing. This in­cludes so­cio-eco­nomic re­con­struc­tion, which is vi­tal for Africa’s de­vel­op­ment. In this, China’s vast mil­i­tary and de­vel­op­men­tal ex­pe­ri­ence will play a prom­i­nent role. Al­though China em­pha­sises a mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach to African peace and sta­bil­ity, it con­tin­ues to col­lab­o­rate with in­di­vid­ual African States. For in­stance, most of its East African projects are bi­lat­eral in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal or pri­vate sec­tor projects. Word of cau­tion Given the AU’s ca­pac­ity chal­lenges in end­ing or con­tain­ing deadly con­flicts, co­op­er­a­tion with China pro­vides a chance for African States to erad­i­cate in­se­cu­rity and in­sta­bil­ity for their own de­vel­op­ment and pros­per­ity. But, they need to be cau­tious that their part­ner­ship with China doesn’t turn into yet an­other re­la­tion­ship char­ac­terised by de­pen­dency and ex­ploita­tion. ● This ar­ti­cle first ap­peared in The Con­ver­sa­tion",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210331,‘ Time to in­vest in tra­di­tional medicines’,"SCI­EN­TISTS must broaden collaboration in re­search and de­vel­op­ment of tra­di­tional medicines as part of global ef­forts to tackle the Covid-19 pan­demic which has taken lives and dis­rupted liveli­hoods glob­ally, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said. In his vir­tual ad­dress at the Fo­rum on Tra­di­tional Chi­nese Medicine and In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion Against Covid-19 yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said while the world is pin­ning its hopes on Covid-19 vac­cines, it is im­per­a­tive to broaden the scope to other ar­eas such as tra­di­tional medicines. “While our hopes are pinned on the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes, it is im­per­a­tive that sci­en­tists broaden collaboration in re­search and de­vel­op­ment of tra­di­tional medicines. This will en­sure safe de­vel­op­ment and de­ploy­ment of our rich indige­nous knowl­edge sys­tems, to tackle the pan­demic. “In the case of Zim­babwe, no­table strides are be­ing made in re­search of the medic­i­nal prop­er­ties of indige­nous plants, specif­i­cally Lip­pia Ja­van­ica (Zum­bani), which is abun­dant in our coun­try and parts of South­ern Africa. Re­search and co­op­er­a­tion in this and other re­gards, is en­cour­aged and most wel­come,” the Pres­i­dent said. Col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­forts be­tween the tra­di­tional and con­ven­tional medicines will con­trib­ute to the trans­for­ma­tion of the med­i­cal pro­vi­sions from vol­ume-based to value-based health care, the Pres­i­dent added. The tra­di­tional medicine vir­tual fo­rum was held un­der the theme “Deepen Ex­changes and Mu­tual Learn­ing of Tra­di­tional Chi­nese Medicine. Build a Global Com­mu­nity of Health for All”, a sub­ject that the Pres­i­dent said res­onates with China’s con­tin­ued global role in the health sector at a time when the world is grap­pling with the Covid-19 pan­demic. Vice Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga, who is also the Min­is­ter of Health and Child Care, Vice Premier of the State Coun­cil and Polit­buro mem­ber of the Com­mu­nist Party of China Cde Sun Chun­lan, Chi­nese Vice Min­is­ter and Sec­re­tary Gen­eral of For­eign Af­fairs Cde Luo Zhao­hui were among other dig­ni­taries who at­tended the meet­ing. “One of the most press­ing tasks for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity there­fore, is to con­tain the Covid19 pan­demic. We must act to­gether to­wards sta­bil­is­ing and re­viv­ing the global econ­omy. This ne­ces­si­tates a stronger re­sponse an­chored by closer sol­i­dar­ity and co­op­er­a­tion, as well as in­for­ma­tion shar­ing within the com­mu­nity of na­tions,” the Pres­i­dent said. He added that tra­di­tional health sys­tems are part of the global her­itage, which are trea­sured as a key com­po­nent of cul­ture in many so­ci­eties. Last year the coun­try opened the Zim­babwe-China Tra­di­tional Chi­nese Medicine (TCM) and Acupunc­ture Cen­tre at the Parireny­atwa Group of Hos­pi­tals in Harare. “In an ef­fort to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment of tra­di­tional medicine, Zim­babwe and China signed a Mem­o­ran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing which has seen the es­tab­lish­ment of Tra­di­tional Chi­nese Medicine clinic at one of my coun­try’s largest re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals.” China, a strate­gic part­ner of Zim­babwe, with re­la­tions dat­ing back to the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle, has played a lead­ing role in as­sist­ing the coun­try fight the Covid-19 pan­demic through the pro­vi­sion of, not only sundries but also huge gifts of vac­cines to help curb the spread of coron­avirus. “In the spirit of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, Zim­babwe re­mains com­mit­ted to col­lab­o­rate and co­op­er­ate with all, at the in­ter­na­tional level, in pur­suit of the global ‘health for all agenda’. This is now more ur­gent given that Covid19 has dealt an un­prece­dented set­back to the global ef­fort to end ex­treme poverty, un­sus­tain­able use of nat­u­ral re­sources, con­flict and cli­mate change. “Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is in­deed our hope for ‘Hu­man­ity Way For­ward’ and a quest to en­sure that no one and no place is left be­hind,” the Pres­i­dent said. Hav­ing al­ready vac­ci­nated more than 60 per­cent of front­line work­ers in the ini­tial phase of the vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, Zim­babwe is presently in its Phase Two of the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme which is tar­get­ing teach­ers, peo­ple with chronic con­di­tions, the se­cu­rity sector among oth­ers.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200921,China’s poverty al­le­vi­a­tion ef­forts of­fer global in­spi­ra­tion,"BEI­JING. — As the rag­ing Covid-19 pan­demic is drag­ging an in­creas­ing num­ber of peo­ple into poverty across the world, China’s poverty al­le­vi­a­tion ef­forts are of­fer­ing hope. China’s achieve­ments and ef­forts in fight­ing poverty have not only con­trib­uted to the global cause of poverty re­duc­tion, but also set a pi­o­neer­ing ex­am­ple of prac­ti­cal sig­nif­i­cance to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. In the past seven decades, China has man­aged to lift 850 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, which ac­counts for more than 70 per­cent of global poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, set­ting a record in hu­man his­tory. At the end of 2019, the num­ber of im­pov­er­ished peo­ple in China’s ru­ral ar­eas fell to 5.51 mil­lion from 98.99 mil­lion in 2012. Fur­ther­more, China is on course to erad­i­cate ex­treme poverty across the coun­try by 2020, which will make the coun­try the first in the world to end ab­so­lute poverty. Given China’s large pop­u­la­tion, such achieve­ments con­trib­uted not only to the global cause of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, but also im­proved the hu­man rights of the Chi­nese peo­ple. End­ing poverty tops the 17 United Na­tions (UN) 2030 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. How­ever, UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said the global re­sponse to re­al­is­ing poverty and en­vi­ron­men­tal goals agreed by world lead­ers in 2015 has not been “am­bi­tious enough,” and it would be very dif­fi­cult to bring the rate of ex­treme poverty be­low 3 per­cent by 2030. Even worse, the UN has pre­dicted that the rav­aging Covid-19 pan­demic would cause an in­creas­ing num­ber of peo­ple to fall into poverty. Will China’s path help the world lessen global wor­ries over poverty? The an­swer is yes. If erad­i­cat­ing poverty can be achieved in such a big and for­merly im­pov­er­ished coun­try like China, other coun­tries are hope­ful they can do it as well. Poverty al­le­vi­a­tion is a “mi­cro­cosm” of China’s de­vel­op­ment, as it demon­strates how the coun­try’s sys­tem ac­tu­ally works on the ground, said Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a lead­ing US ex­pert on China and chair­man of the Kuhn Foun­da­tion. China’s ex­pe­ri­ence has also shown that the poverty al­le­vi­a­tion cause must be based on one coun­try’s own na­tional con­di­tions and en­tails prac­ti­cal ac­tions and the in­volve­ment of the whole so­ci­ety. To max­imise poverty al­le­vi­a­tion re­sults, Bei­jing has ar­ranged dif­fer­ent funds and cus­tomised sup­port ac­cord­ing to dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions in vil­lages and fam­i­lies. In­ter­na­tional en­gage­ment has also played a key role in China’s poverty al­le­vi­a­tion cause. In­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions in­clud­ing the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme and the World Food Pro­gramme have sup­ported China, and China also played an ac­tive role in global co­op­er­a­tion, of­fer­ing much help to other coun­tries’ poverty-re­duc­tion ef­forts via pro­vid­ing ma­te­rial, fi­nan­cial aid or per­son­nel sup­port. For­mer UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Ban Ki-moon has praised China’s na­tional de­vel­op­ment and suc­cess in im­ple­ment­ing the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals, say­ing it was in­te­gral to global gains in the field. As al­ways, uni­lat­er­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism pose a stum­bling block in the global cause of poverty re­duc­tion. The world should re­main sober and re­alise that only through open co­op­er­a­tion can we em­brace com­mon de­vel­op­ment, which is the fun­da­men­tal way to wipe out poverty. Mean­while, ex­treme poverty is not about a lack of in­come alone, or faults of in­di­vid­u­als or fam­i­lies, said Olivier De Schut­ter, UN Spe­cial Rap­por­teur on ex­treme poverty and hu­man rights. “It’s about po­lit­i­cal choices that ex­clude, dis­crim­i­nate and marginalise peo­ple,” he said. China’s poverty re­duc­tion ef­forts will never end as al­le­vi­at­ing poverty in all forms still re­mains a long-term cause for the whole world. Thus it is in­dis­pens­able for coun­tries to tackle this com­mon chal­lenge fac­ing hu­man­ity with strong po­lit­i­cal wills, tar­geted poli­cies and close in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210329,"AfDB pegs Zim growth at 4,2%","ZIM­BABWE’S econ­omy con­tracted by 10% last year and is en­vis­aged to grow by 4,2% in 2021 if ef­fec­tive mea­sures are taken to sta­bilise for­eign ex­change and avoid ex­ces­sive money cre­ation, the African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) said in a state­ment on Fri­day. The pan-African lender had pre­vi­ously pro­jected a 5,6% growth. The 4,2% growth rate is be­low the 7,4% pro­jected by the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe (RBZ) in Fe­bru­ary, but slightly higher than the 2,5% growth pro­jected by the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank’s 2,8% pro­jec­tion. In its lat­est African Eco­nomic Out­look 2021 re­port ti­tled From Debt Res­o­lu­tion to Growth: The Road Ahead for Africa, AfDB said the COVID-19 pan­demic, high in­fla­tion and drought un­der­pinned the 10% con­trac­tion in 2020. Zim­babwe’s in­fla­tion rose to a post-dol­lar­i­sa­tion high of 839% in July last year, be­fore re­ced­ing to 341% by De­cem­ber 2020. The RBZ has pro­jected the rate to plum­met to about 10% by the end of this year. “Be­fore the COVID-19 pan­demic, Zim­babwe’s econ­omy was al­ready in re­ces­sion, con­tract­ing by 6% in 2019. Out­put fell be­cause of eco­nomic in­sta­bil­ity and the re­moval of sub­si­dies on maize meal, fuel, and elec­tric­ity prices,” AfDB said. “The on­set of the COVID-19 pan­demic and con­tin­ued drought led to 10% con­trac­tion in real GDP [gross do­mes­tic prod­uct] in 2020. In­fla­tion soared, av­er­ag­ing 622,8% in 2020, up from 226,9% in 2019. For­eign ex­change re­forms were in­sti­tuted in June 2020, which damp­ened an in­fla­tion that raged at an an­nual rate of 838% in July. Fis­cal and cur­rent ac­count deficits also re­cov­ered af­ter July, but both de­te­ri­o­rated for the year as a whole,” AfDB said. Ac­cord­ing to the re­gional bank, Zim­babwe’s bud­get deficit rose from 2,7% in 2019 to 2,9% in 2020 while the cur­rent ac­count moved from a sur­plus of 1,1% of GDP in 2019 to a deficit of 1,9% in 2020. “The ex­change rate de­pre­ci­ated from $2,5 in Fe­bru­ary 2019 and sta­bil­is­ing around $82 to the US dol­lar in De­cem­ber 2020. Poverty stood at 70,5% in 2019 while un­em­ploy­ment re­mained high at over 21%.The bank­ing sys­tem is sta­ble. Banks have some room to in­crease credit. The loan-to-de­posit ra­tio was 38,8% in 2020 against a bench­mark of 70%. Non-per­form­ing loans are at 3,23%, well un­der the reg­u­la­tory bench­mark of 5%. The cap­i­tal ad­e­quacy ra­tio is more than three times the reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ment of 12%,” the bank said. “Mod­est eco­nomic re­cov­ery is pro­jected in 2021 if ef­fec­tive mea­sures are taken to sta­bilise for­eign ex­change and avoid ex­ces­sive money cre­ation. But the out­look is clouded by a num­ber of fac­tors. The pan­demic and gov­ern­ment poli­cies to con­tain the dis­ease will af­fect pro­duc­tion lev­els across all sec­tors — although a par­tial eas­ing of bor­der clo­sures may help.” AfDB said the in­dus­trial and min­ing sec­tors would also be af­fected by sev­eral draw­backs. “The prob­lems are ex­ac­er­bated by debt dis­tress and ar­rears, and low in­ter­na­tional re­serves that can cover less than one month of im­ports. Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion will re­main chal­lenged in 2021 although the for­eign ex­change re­forms, espe­cially the weekly forex auc­tions in­tro­duced in June 2020 could cre­ate price sta­bil­ity and cre­ate room for mod­est eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” it said. The bank noted that Zim­babwe’s to­tal public debt was US$11,1 bil­lion, which trans­lates to 53,9% of GDP. It said 95,6% of this debt was ex­ter­nal, in­clud­ing $6,4 bil­lion in ar­rears to in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, bi­lat­eral, and pri­vate cred­i­tors. Zim­babwe has been in de­fault to global lenders since 2000. A staff-mon­i­tored pro­gramme with the IMF to help Zim­babwe im­ple­ment eco­nomic poli­cies from May 2019 to March 2020 col­lapsed in Septem­ber 2019, although gov­ern­ment has said the IMF is head­ing back to Zim­babwe in a few months’ time. “The gov­ern­ment and the IMF have not agreed to a new ar­range­ment, which would be aimed at help­ing Zim­babwe clear its ar­rears. As a re­sult, the coun­try will have to con­tinue to rely largely on do­mes­tic re­source mo­bil­i­sa­tion and bor­row­ing from non-Paris Club mem­bers like China. The in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions will not re­sume lend­ing un­til debt ar­rears are cleared,” AfDB said.",津巴布韦

For ex­am­ple, Robert Mu­gabe was in power for 37 years, Ken­neth Kaunda (27 years), Julius Ny­erere (21 years) and Muam­mar Gaddafi for 42 years. Ob­vi­ously, this lack of lead­er­ship re­newal is part of the ra­tio­nale why any ef­forts at du­pli­cat­ing the Chi­nese model have been dis­as­trous on the con­ti­nent. Of course, in 2018, the Chi­nese took a strate­gic re­view of the two-term lim­its (10-year re­newal) to ac­com­mo­date their rapid growth am­bi­tions and ad­dress their geopo­lit­i­cal concerns through en­sur­ing con­ti­nu­ity and strong lead­er­ship. Again, this shows that model is dy­namic and can be changed by the Chi­nese in pur­suit of Chi­nese in­ter­ests. It is not some dog­matic and un­change­able dis­po­si­tion bor­rowed or im­posed from some for­eign land. They in­tro­duced it, and it served its pur­pose. Cir­cum­stances de­manded a dif­fer­ent tac­tic, so they changed the pro­vi­sion. In fu­ture, de­pend­ing on their strate­gic in­ter­ests and pre­vail­ing chal­lenges, they might re-in­tro­duce it. That is the Chi­nese model, to­tally con­trolled by the Chi­nese. They do not have to please any pry­ing and un­in­vited ex­ter­nal play­ers, such as the United States. Their re­tort to the Amer­i­cans would be very apt and crude: “Mind your busi­ness. Our econ­omy is per­form­ing bet­ter than yours. If we with­draw our in­vest­ments from your coun­try, your econ­omy will col­lapse! More im­por­tantly, we will soon be over­tak­ing you GDP-wise any­way. Give us a break!” When you are suc­cess­ful, no one can pa­tro­n­ise you. Game recog­nises game. In­deed, it is self-ev­i­dent that the Chi­nese model is more about lead­er­ship, rather than show­man­ship and abil­ity to raise cam­paign fi­nance, as ex­em­pli­fied by the United States. We must un­der­stand that China’s mer­i­to­cratic gov­er­nance chal­lenges the tra­di­tional di­chotomy of “democ­racy ver­sus au­toc­racy”. The con­tent or sub­stance is as im­por­tant as the form. Within the one-party state sys­tem, the Chi­nese have de­liv­ered good gov­er­nance, com­pe­tent lead­er­ship, poverty erad­i­ca­tion, and shared eco­nomic pros­per­ity. De­spite its many lim­i­ta­tions, in­clud­ing a demo­cratic deficit and dis­re­spect of hu­man rights, the Chi­nese model has pro­duced the world’s fastest-grow­ing econ­omy and has dra­mat­i­cally en­hanced the qual­ity of life for most Chi­nese peo­ple. Suc­cesses of the Chi­nese model At this point, it is in­struc­tive to enu­mer­ate the suc­cesses of the Chi­nese model. Let us walk through some of the sta­tis­tics that demon­strate how the model has worked for the coun­try. China was able to pull 800 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty since 1978. They ended ab­ject poverty (US$2 a day ex­is­tence) in Fe­bru­ary 2021. Their GDP is US$14.3 tril­lion, the sec­ond largest after United States (US$21.4 tril­lion). In fact, China is poised to over­take the United States as the world big­gest econ­omy in 2027. In March 2021, ex­perts in the United States pre­dict that China will be the world’s ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) su­per­power ahead of the United States in AI in­no­va­tions and other Fourth In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion tech­nolo­gies (4IR). Clearly, it is an undis­puted fact that the Chi­nese model de­liv­ered and con­tin­ues to de­liver eco­nomic pros­per­ity for its cit­i­zens while pro­pel­ling China to­wards un­ques­tion­able global dom­i­nance. From a back­ward and strug­gling na­tion right into the sec­ond big­gest econ­omy glob­ally, now clos­ing in to be the big­gest econ­omy in the world. That is a mir­a­cle. A nu­clear power with the largest army in the world and a thriv­ing space pro­gramme. *This is an ex­cerpt from Arthur Mu­tam­bara’s up­com­ing book: In Search of the Elu­sive Zim­bab­wean Dream: Vol­ume 3",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20210108,China’s poverty re­duc­tion of­fers lessons for Africa,"Last month, China de­clared vic­tory over ex­treme poverty fol­low­ing painstak­ing im­ple­men­ta­tion of care­fully de­signed, decades-long poverty re­duc­tion pro­grammes. China now holds the record as the coun­try with the most con­se­quen­tial feat against penury, hav­ing lifted more than 800 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty. THIS suc­cess has not only earned Bei­jing ad­mi­ra­tion from around the world, but is a pow­er­ful ex­am­ple of what is pos­si­ble when gov­ern­ment and peo­ple work to­gether on a spe­cific vi­sion. In many ways, China is an in­spi­ra­tion to the African con­ti­nent as far as poverty re­duc­tion is con­cerned. Africa is home to the largest num­ber of de­vel­op­ing economies, while China is now the largest de­vel­op­ing econ­omy, aim­ing for mod­er­ately pros­per­ous sta­tus. With more than 30 per­cent of Africans still living in ex­treme poverty-con­sti­tut­ing over 70 per­cent of the world's poor — it is not hard to un­der­stand why China's en­vi­able mile­stones in poverty re­duc­tion con­tinue to res­onate with gov­ern­ments and cit­i­zens in Africa. For in­stance, much work on elim­i­nat­ing poverty from the face of the Earth should be ac­tu­al­ized in Africa to re­alise the United Na­tions Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. If noth­ing is done dif­fer­ently, the World Bank es­ti­mates that up to 90 per­cent of global poverty will be on the con­ti­nent by 2030. This is wor­ri­some, be­cause the year 2030 is also the UN's dead­line for elim­i­nat­ing poverty in all forms. China's poverty re­duc­tion in ru­ral ar­eas, an­chored on agri­cul­ture mod­ern­iza­tion, of­fers good in­sights for Africa's so­cioe­co­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. Since the found­ing of the Peo­ple's Repub­lic of China, the na­tion's agri­cul­ture has un­der­gone a se­ries of im­prove­ments span­ning land re­forms, agri­cul­tural co-op­er­a­tives and mar­keti­sa­tion. Hoisted by mod­ern farm­ing meth­ods, tar­geted in­sti­tu­tions as well as pro­gres­sive poli­cies, the shift from sub­sis­tence to com­pre­hen­sive agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion eco­nom­i­cally em­pow­ered China's ru­ral ma­jor­ity and formed a key com­po­nent of poverty re­duc­tion. To feed its rapidly grow­ing pop­u­la­tion of 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple, Africa must move be­yond tra­di­tional, one-di­men­sional agri­cul­ture into a mul­ti­fac­eted en­ter­prise driven by sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. In this way, the con­ti­nent can re­alise higher in­puts, low con­sump­tion, high qual­ity and ef­fi­ciency in its agri­cul­tural value chains. The African Union has set the task of end­ing hunger on the con­ti­nent by 2025 — a task made more chal­leng­ing by the Covid-19 global pan­demic, which is push­ing mil­lions more African house­holds into ex­treme poverty. Given that the ma­jor­ity of Africa's pop­u­la­tion live in ru­ral ar­eas, ef­fec­tive poverty re­duc­tion pro­grammes should tar­get that group, and agri­cul­ture re­mains the strong­est ve­hi­cle to de­liver eco­nomic sustainability and food se­cu­rity. Africa can learn from China about the use of in­for­ma­tion tech­nolo­gies in mar­ket­ing agri­cul­tural pro­duce. The Taobao vil­lage model has, for ex­am­ple, en­abled mil­lions of farm­ers to reach far-away clients, thanks to the power and reach of the in­ter­net. This has not only led to more in­clu­sive growth, but also has ben­e­fited mul­ti­plier in­dus­tries, such as lo­gis­tics, that are cru­cial to en­sur­ing that prod­ucts reach buy­ers. In the wake of cli­mate change, Africa's agri­cul­ture should also be an­chored on sus­tain­able eco­log­i­cal con­ser­va­tion prac­tices. De­spite be­ing the least green­house gas emit­ter, the con­ti­nent has borne the brunt of global warm­ing with floods, droughts and er­ratic rain­fall, fur­ther com­pound­ing its agri­cul­tural prospects. Fi­nally, there is no doubt that in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity and mar­ket in­te­gra­tion are strong fac­tors in hoist­ing mod­ern agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. Africa is cur­rently im­ple­ment­ing the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area, an am­bi­tious pro­ject that aims at in­te­grat­ing African economies, cur­rently val­ued at US$3,4 tril­lion. China and the African Union have both ini­ti­ated pol­icy di­a­logue to fuse the as­pi­ra­tions of the AfCFTA and the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. A suc­cess­ful AfCFTA would mean greater po­ten­tial for Africa's agri­cul­ture, and China is proving to be a de­pend­able part­ner to de­liver on the prom­ise. — China Daily.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201209,China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion a suc­cess,"BEI­JING. – China’s suc­cess in lift­ing 10 per­cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion out of poverty is “the big­gest suc­cess in this re­gard over a 40-year pe­riod ever,” renowned Bri­tish econ­o­mist Jim O’Neill, chair­man of the Lon­don-based think tank Chatham House, said re­cently in an in­ter­view. His re­marks came as China an­nounced last Thurs­day that it has ac­com­plished its poverty alle­vi­a­tion tar­get for the new era on sched­ule and achieved a sig­nif­i­cant vic­tory that has im­pressed the world. It has been cru­cial for China to en­able its strong gross do­mes­tic prod­uct growth rate over the 40 years, said O’Neill, who in 2001 coined the acro­nym BRIC that stands for Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, and China, a bloc of emerg­ing economies that stood to have a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the world econ­omy in the fu­ture. Asked about what eco­nomic and so­cial the­ory could be proven ef­fec­tive in China’s ef­forts to elim­i­nate poverty, O’Neill said it might be “due to a com­bi­na­tion” of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, es­pe­cially ur­ban­i­sa­tion, wel­com­ing in­te­gra­tion to the world trade sys­tem, in­clud­ing par­tic­i­pa­tion in for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, and clear pri­ori­ti­sa­tion and com­mit­ment from the Chi­nese govern­ment. Over the past 40-plus years of re­form and open­ing-up, more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple in China have been lifted out of poverty — more than 70 per­cent of the global re­duc­tion in poverty. “More coun­tries leav­ing poverty and be­com­ing pros­per­ous, not only helps them, and their ci­ti­zens, through in­ter­na­tional trade, and in­creased con­sumer spend­ing, it also helps ev­ery­one else,” he said. – Xin­hua.",津巴布韦

out­look up­ward","TLameez Omar­jee he has re­vised the growth out­look for South Africa from 2,8per­cent to 3,1 per­cent. The IMF ex­pects a stronger global re­cov­ery and has re­vised the growth out­look from 5,5 per­cent to 6 per­cent in 2021. The IMF on Tuesday re­leased its World Eco­nomic Out­look re­port as part of the IMF-World Bank spring meet­ings this year. The mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tion up­wardly re­vised the growth out­look for South Africa from 2.8 per­cent to 3.1 per­cent. By com­par­i­son, the South Africa Re­serve Bank ( SARB) ex­pects the do­mes­tic econ­omy to ex­pand to 3,8 per­cent, and the Na­tional Trea­sury sees the econ­omy re­bound­ing to 3,3 per­cent, from a con­trac­tion of 7 per­cent. The World Bank ex­pects the SA econ­omy to grow to 3 per­cent in 2021. Last week in its Quar­terly Bul­letin for March 2021, the SARB said its records show that in 2020, the SA econ­omy suf­fered its sec­ond-largest con­trac­tion in 100 years. The SARB started keep­ing records in 1912. Much of the do­mes­tic econ­omy and that of the world’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery de­pends on the rollout of Covid-19 vac­cines. The IMF in­di­cated that the ro­bust growth is at­trib­uted to ad­di­tional fis­cal sup­port in a few large economies, as well as the dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines which will fuel re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half of the year. The global econ­omy is es­ti­mated to have con­tracted by 3.3 per­cent in 2020, and the IMF ex­pects this would have been three times worse with­out the “ex­tra­or­di­nary” pol­icy sup­port rolled out by na­tions. “Thanks to un­prece­dented pol­icy re­sponse, the Covid-19 re­ces­sion is likely to leave smaller scars than the 2008 global fi­nan­cial crisis,” the re­port read. Global growth has been re­vised to 4.4 per­cent in 2022, and over the medium-term, it is ex­pected to mod­er­ate to 3.3 per­cent. But the re­cov­ery is not even — emerg­ing mar­ket economies and low-in­come de­vel­op­ing coun­ties are ex­pected to suf­fer “more sig­nif­i­cant” medium-term losses due to the pan­demic, the re­port read. “Un­like af­ter the 2008 crisis, this time it is emerg­ing mar­kets and low-in­come coun­tries that are ex­pected to suf­fer greater scar­ring, given their more lim­ited pol­icy space,” said Gita Gopinath, eco­nomic coun­sel­lor and di­rec­tor of re­search at the IMF. The sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa re­gion - which in­cludes Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Nige­ria - con­tin­ues to feel the pan­demic’s im­pacts. The area suf­fered a con­trac­tion of -1,9 per­cent in 2020 but is ex­pected to re­bound to 3,4 per­cent in 2021 - lower than what was an­tic­i­pated be­fore the pan­demic. “Tourism-re­liant economies will likely be the most af­fected,” the re­port read. “Out­put losses have been par­tic­u­larly large for coun­tries that rely on tourism and com­mod­ity ex­ports and for those with lim­ited pol­icy space to re­spond.” While China re­turned to its pre-Covid-19 GDP lev­els in 2020, the US is ex­pected to sur­pass its pre-Covid-19 GDP lev­els in 2021. Other na­tions could take as long as 2023 to re­cover, the IMF in­di­cated. In­creas­ing in­come in­equal­ity The IMF also high­lighted that in­come in­equal­ity would likely in­crease sig­nif­i­cantly, mainly due to the pan­demic. “Close to 95 mil­lion more peo­ple are es­ti­mated to have fallen be­low the thresh­old of ex­treme poverty in 2020 com­pared to pre-pan­demic pro­jec­tions,” the re­port read. There have also been “learn­ing losses”, par­tic­u­larly in low-in­come and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries which had to in­tro­duce school clo­sures. “Unequal set­backs to school­ing could fur­ther am­plify in­come in­equal­ity.” The de­vel­op­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic — such as the emer­gence of new strains — re­mains a risk to the global out­look, the IMF warned. The IMF sug­gested that pol­i­cy­mak­ers pri­ori­tise pru­dent poli­cies in the face of un­cer­tainty. Pol­i­cy­mak­ers should also be pre­pared to “flex­i­bly ad­just” pol­icy sup­port. “… Coun­tries will need to tai­lor their pol­icy re­sponses to the stage of the pan­demic, the strength of the re­cov­ery, and struc­tural char­ac­ter­is­tics of the econ­omy,” the re­port read. “While the pan­demic con­tin­ues, poli­cies should first fo­cus on es­cap­ing the crisis, pri­ori­tis­ing health care spend­ing, pro­vid­ing well-tar­geted fis­cal sup­port, and main­tain­ing ac­com­moda­tive mon­e­tary pol­icy while mon­i­tor­ing fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity risks.” The IMF also called for strong in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion - not only to nar­row the gap in liv­ing stan­dards of low-in­come de­vel­op­ing coun­tries but also to en­sure the uni­ver­sal dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines, at af­ford­able prices. “Faster progress in vac­ci­na­tions can up­lift the forecast, while a more pro­longed pan­demic with virus vari­ants and delayed vac­cines can lead to a sharp down­grade,” said Gopinath. “On the in­ter­na­tional stage, first and fore­most, coun­tries need to work to­gether to en­sure uni­ver­sal vac­ci­na­tion. While some coun­tries will get to wide­spread vac­ci­na­tions by the sum­mer, most will likely have to wait till the end of next year,” Gopinath added.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210211,In­ter­fer­ence in China’s af­fairs doomed to fail,"IN the mid­dle of Jan­uary 2021, Mike Pom­peo re­leased a state­ment declar­ing, on be­half of the State De­part­ment of US, that China had com­mit­ted crimes against hu­man­ity and geno­cide to Mus­lim Uyghurs and other mem­bers of eth­nic mi­nor­ity groups in Xin­jiang. Later, Sec­re­tary of State An­thony John Blinken said he con­sid­ered the mass de­ten­tion of cer­tain eth­nic minorities in the Xin­jiang re­gion and ster­il­i­sa­tion pro­grammes there to be “geno­cide”. This may trig­ger in­ter­na­tional re­sponses with oth­ers say­ing that some coun­tries may boy­cott the 2022 Bei­jing Winter Olympics? How­ever, Pom­peo’s ven­omous lies in the past sev­eral years are too nu­mer­ous to be counted, and the mat­ter men­tioned above is only one of those lu­di­crous fab­ri­ca­tions. Crimes against hu­man­ity and geno­cide are clearly-de­fined in in­ter­na­tional law. “China com­mit­ting geno­cide and crimes against hu­man­ity in Xin­jiang” is a com­pletely false al­le­ga­tion and a ma­li­cious fab­ri­ca­tion hyped up by cer­tain anti-China, anti-com­mu­nist forces, with Pom­peo be­ing a fa­nat­i­cal pi­o­neer. In 2019, Xin­jiang had over 200 mil­lion do­mes­tic and for­eign trav­ellers. The re­gion re­ceived 1 200-plus diplo­mats, jour­nal­ists and rep­re­sen­ta­tives of re­li­gious groups from more than 100 coun­tries. They wit­nessed unity, amity and hap­pi­ness among var­i­ous eth­nic groups as well as the scenic views of Xin­jiang. The life ex­pectancy of Xin­jiang res­i­dents grew from 30 to 72 years over the past six decades or so. The Uyghur pop­u­la­tion in­creased by 25,04 per­cent from 2010 to 2018, higher than the in­crease rate of the whole Xin­jiang pop­u­la­tion, which stood at 13,99 per­cent, and much higher than the two per­cent growth rate of the Han pop­u­la­tion. Lan­guages, tra­di­tional cul­tures and cus­toms of all eth­nic minorities in Xin­jiang have been well pro­tected and in­her­ited. All res­i­dents fully en­joy their rights, in­clud­ing the right to sub­sis­tence and de­vel­op­ment. China’s Xin­jiang has been faith­fully im­ple­ment­ing the plan of ac­tion to pre­vent vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism and law­fully tak­ing pre­ven­tive counter-ter­ror­ism and de-rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion mea­sures. The plan of ac­tion ef­fec­tively pro­tected Xin­jiang’s se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity and res­i­dents’ safety. There hasn’t been any vi­o­lent or ter­ror­ist case over the past four years or so. China pro­tects workers’ rights and has made a lot of ef­forts to pro­vide train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and jobs for peo­ple of all eth­nic groups in Xin­jiang. This is to en­cour­age, as­sist and sup­port them in shak­ing off poverty and liv­ing a bet­ter life through dili­gence and hard work. Dur­ing the fight against the Covid19 pan­demic, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment put peo­ple lives at the cen­tre front by tak­ing res­o­lute, sci­en­tific and de­ci­sive mea­sures to pro­tect the safety and health of all peo­ple in­clud­ing Uyghurs to the great­est ex­tent pos­si­ble. Pom­peo’s lies on Xin­jiang and other mat­ters are not only ma­jor in­sults on the 1,4 bil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple in­clud­ing 25 mil­lion Xin­jiang res­i­dents, but also ma­jor in­sults on the judg­ment of Amer­i­can peo­ple and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. What is even more worse, he has be­trayed and chal­lenged hu­man­ity’s moral­ity and con­science. Pom­peo’s ne­glect of truth and pur­suit of lies re­flects not only his de­spi­ca­ble char­ac­ter, but also some Amer­i­can forces’ ill in­ten­tion to in­ter­fere in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, un­der­mine China’s sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity and con­tain China’s de­vel­op­ment. All un­der the pre­text of human rights in Xin­jiang, which is an en­tirely fab­ri­cated is­sue serv­ing to smear China and the CPC. Pom­peo and his like should know this: our peace­ful and pros­per­ous Xin­jiang will not be dragged through mud by their smear­ing and slan­der. The 1,4 bil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple of 56 eth­nic groups, united closely as seeds of a pomegranate, will not be slowed for a sec­ond by their petty dis­trac­tions in our jour­ney to­wards the great na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion. Jus­tice may be late, but it will al­ways catch up. There is no bet­ter place than the dust­bin of his­tory for Pom­peo and all his vi­cious lies and in­flu­ence. His­tory will de­liver a fair ver­dict on them and the day of reck­on­ing will come. Mushahid Hus­sain Syed, Chair­man of Pak­istan’s Se­nate Stand­ing Committee on For­eign Af­fairs, said in a re­cent interview that the eco­nomic growth of China’s Xin­jiang Uyghur au­ton­o­mous re­gion and the pop­u­la­tion growth of the Uyghur com­mu­nity be­lie the po­lit­i­cally-mo­ti­vated fic­tion ped­dled by a few West­ern politi­cians. Also the UAE am­bas­sador to China Ali Al Dha­heri spoke highly of Xin­jiang’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and progress in poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, ap­plauded the ef­fec­tive counter-ter­ror­ism and de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion ef­forts and ex­pressed hope for stronger co­op­er­a­tion with China on this front. As for the rip­ple ef­fects some peo­ple are con­cerned about, in­clud­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of some peo­ple boy­cotting the Winter Olympics, my an­swer is very clear. China is not the only vic­tim to Pom­peo’s poi­sonous lies and ru­mors. Many Amer­i­can peo­ple and the up­com­ing US ad­min­is­tra­tion also loathe their lies and ru­mours. All nor­mal, ra­tio­nal peo­ple with a sober mind can draw con­clu­sions based on facts. Pom­peo’s lies and ru­mours are based on the fab­ri­ca­tions made by anti-China scholar Adrian Zenz and the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Policy Institute. The US me­dia has a clear un­der­stand­ing of what they have done. For in­stance, as re­vealed by an Amer­i­can web­site, ru­mours on Xin­jiang are part of their pub­lic­ity blitz against China, in­clud­ing spread­ing ru­mours to slan­der and even de­monise China. In par­tic­u­lar, they hyped up bi­ased and base­less fal­la­cies to co­or­di­nate with anti-China forces in the United States to smear Xin­jiang’s counter-ter­ror­ism and de-rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion ef­forts, tes­ti­fy­ing to the fact that they have no cred­i­bil­ity at all. Their fel­low coun­try­men in the United States and Aus­tralia have pointed out their lack of in­tegrity, which brings shame to their home coun­try. If you are in­ter­ested in the truth of what’s hap­pen­ing in Xin­jiang, we surely wel­come your visit to China to see Xin­jiang with your own eyes, hear the voices from over 25 mil­lion Xin­jiang res­i­dents of var­i­ous eth­nic groups, and get to know the mind of the 1,4 bil­lion Chi­nese peo­ple. Re­gard­ing the Winter Olympics, the prepa­ra­tions are be­ing smoothly car­ried out. China has con­fi­dence that it will be an ex­tra­or­di­nary gath­er­ing.",津巴布韦

At its peak, post-in­de­pen­dence in the late 1980s, the coun­try used to ex­port beef worth over US$35 mil­lion, with an an­nual beef quota to the Euro­pean mar­ket of 9 100 tonnes. In cur­rent terms, this would trans­late to about US$400 mil­lion, had the in­dus­try re­mained vi­brant.

By 2000, the beef in­dus­try had all but crum­bled. To date, there is vir­tu­ally no or sig­nif­i­cant recorded ex­ports of beef from Zim­babwe. The emer­gence of South African re­tail­ers, and high beef prices in Zim­babwe, has led to a sub­sti­tu­tion ef­fect of beef with cheaper white meat, es­pe­cially poul­try cuts from neigh­bour­ing South Africa and other mar­kets. In a cat­tle breed­ing coun­try such as Zim­babwe, the beef in­dus­try should be thriv­ing, given that Zim­babwe has agro-eco­log­i­cal re­gions that are bet­ter suited for cat­tle ranch­ing. The pro­duc­tion sys­tem in Zim­babwe gives the coun­try a nat­u­ral niche mar­ket po­ten­tial for grass­fed and or­ganic beef. This beef fetches a premium in ex­port mar­kets such as the Euro­pean Union, China, and the United Arab Emi­rates. In early 1990s, drought, disease out­breaks, and aus­ter­ity mea­sures af­fected the beef in­dus­try. Fur­ther­more, the land re­form pro­gramme of the early 2000s dis­rupted all farm­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and led to the de­ple­tion of the na­tional herd and the col­lapse of the beef ex­port in­dus­try. The lack of pub­lic sup­port ser­vices for long-term in­vest­ment, given the in­se­cu­rity of land ten­ure and the de­fi­cien­cies of disease con­trol sys­tems, lead­ing to out­breaks, wors­ened the sit­u­a­tion. Out­breaks of foot-and-mouth disease and bovine spongi­form en­cephalopa­thy have trig­gered im­port bans, which in turn have dec­i­mated beef ex­ports from Zim­babwe. An in­dus­try that was once dom­i­nated by com­mer­cial farm­ers has seen small­holder farm­ers be­com­ing the main suppliers of Zim­babwe’s beef in­dus­try post-2000. Our in-house sta­tis­ti­cal es­ti­mate has small­holder farm­ers ac­count­ing for about 90% of the na­tional herd, with emerg­ing com­mer­cial and full com­mer­cial farm­ers rep­re­sent­ing a com­bined 10% of the cat­tle pop­u­la­tion. Com­mer­cial farm­ers that have emerged since 2000 have strug­gled to make mean­ing­ful con­tri­bu­tion to the beef in­dus­try. This has largely been due to a lack of cap­i­tal and ap­pro­pri­ate in­fra­struc­ture. Ab­sen­tee farm­ers, whose pri­mary in­ter­est and ex­per­tise is not cat­tle ranch­ing, have not made the sit­u­a­tion any bet­ter. The best time to fix your roof is when the sun is shin­ing There is no doubt that there will al­ways be a mar­ket for beef. The ques­tion is: how big will the mar­ket be? The in­dus­try has a choice be­tween con­trol­ling its own destiny and ap­a­thy to the threat that con­fronts it. Zim­babwe’s beef sec­tor is at a “fork in the road” and has two op­tions. Firstly, the sec­tor can con­tinue with the busi­ness-as-usual ap­proach and live in the rem­nants of past glory. Se­condly, the sec­tor can re­or­gan­ise and rein­vig­o­rate it­self so that it again be­comes a lead­ing beef pro­ducer in the south­ern African re­gion. The sec­ond op­tion is plau­si­ble, as seen by the re­newed in­ter­est from both gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor to re­sus­ci­tate the ail­ing in­dus­try. The tar­get should, how­ever, be ex­port-stan­dard pro­duc­tion with tar­get mar­kets go­ing be­yond the Zim­bab­wean bor­ders. As a start­ing point, the coun­try would need to make con­certed ef­forts to in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture, both hard and soft, while pro­vid­ing pub­lic sup­port and creat­ing cer­tainty in the mar­ket to at­tract in­vestors. In­deed, Zim­babwe’s in­fra­struc­ture is old and di­lap­i­dated, but func­tional. With a bit of stim­u­lus in the form of fi­nan­cial in­jec­tions for re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­vest­ment, the beef sec­tor can boost Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery, thus creat­ing much­needed em­ploy­ment and poverty re­duc­tion. Fur­ther­more, there needs to be a con­certed ef­fort by in­dus­try play­ers across the value chain to co­or­di­nate and en­sure that link­ages in the value chain are strength­ened to en­hance com­pet­i­tive­ness. This is be­cause a value chain is as good as its weak­est link. Achiev­ing com­pet­i­tive­ness ob­jec­tives within the beef value chain will also re­quire a great deal of in­no­va­tion, en­trepreneur­ship, and learn­ing — in­clud­ing farmer train­ing and ed­u­ca­tion — by ac­tors through­out the value chain. There is a need for key play­ers to iden­tify mar­ket sig­nals and op­por­tu­ni­ties, while also trans­lat­ing these into busi­ness mod­els that en­sure ef­fi­ciency across the value chain. Tap­ping into the ex­port mar­ket af­ter such a long hia­tus means that the process will not be easy. Long-term in­vest­ments are a ne­ces­sity at this point. There is, how­ever, an op­por­tu­nity for Zim­babwe to use the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) as the con­duit for re-en­try into the beef global mar­ket. African coun­tries agreed to es­tab­lish a con­ti­nen­tal free trade area which be­came op­er­a­tional on Jan­uary 1, 2021., The AfCFTA, if fully im­ple­mented, pro­vides for im­me­di­ate elim­i­na­tion of 90% of ex­ist­ing tar­iffs, with ad­di­tional 10% des­ig­nated “sen­si­tive” be­ing re­moved at a later stage. Low-hang­ing fruits are closer to home in mar­kets such as Mozam­bique, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo and An­gola. Be­yond south­ern Africa, Zim­babwe through the AfCFTA can pen­e­trate mar­kets in the north, such as Egypt, where there is a huge de­mand for qual­ity premium beef. By start­ing with mar­kets closer to home, Zim­babwe can gain the ex­pe­ri­ence nec­es­sary to min­imise risks and loss when it starts to ven­ture into highly com­pet­i­tive and more strin­gent mar­kets in Asia, Mid­dle East, and the tra­di­tional mar­kets of the EU.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210401,Zim-To­bacco in­dus­try op­ti­mistic,"THE Zim­bab­wean to­bacco sell­ing sea­son is sched­uled to start this month. The trade is, how­ever, fore­cast­ing lower vol­umes but higher qual­ity than that of last year. Se­cure prices are also pro­jected dur­ing the com­ing mar­ket­ing sea­son, and traders are an­tic­i­pated to bring in over US$500 mil­lion to the mar­ket. On a global over­view, trade de­vel­op­ments have seen the to­bacco sec­tor come un­der global height­ened scru­tiny from reg­u­la­tory bod­ies and the pub­lic, which has led to an en­dur­ing de­cline in vol­ume sales. Ac­cord­ing to BAT, cig­a­rette vol­umes have been falling and this is largely due to in­creased reg­u­la­tion and chang­ing so­ci­etal at­ti­tudes. One rea­son for the de­cline of le­gal to­bacco vol­umes is the con­tin­ued rise in il­licit prod­uct con­sump­tion. This is now es­ti­mated to ac­count for 12% of the global to­bacco mar­ket. A num­ber of fac­tors are driv­ing the sig­nif­i­cant and grow­ing il­licit cig­a­rette trade. These in­clude the fact that cig­a­rettes re­main a re­li­able source of tax rev­enue for gov­ern­ments world­wide, price dif­fer­en­tials between mar­kets, reg­u­la­tory changes and broader macro-eco­nomic pres­sures. It is gen­er­ally ac­cepted that there is a di­rect cor­re­la­tion between steep, ad hoc in­creases in taxes and il­licit sales. “Be­yond dis­rup­tion to sup­ply chains, an­a­lysts be­lieve the short-term im­pact of Covid-19 on the to­bacco in­dus­try will be rel­a­tively lim­ited. It is likely that key cig­a­rette vol­umes were only slightly lower than ex­pected in 2020, in a num­ber of mar­kets glob­ally. This im­pact on vol­umes is ex­pected to be felt un­equally across ge­ogra­phies, with re­silience seen across more de­vel­oped mar­kets while de­vel­op­ing mar­kets ex­pe­ri­ence po­ten­tially greater numbers of con­sumers turn­ing to the il­licit mar­ket. Pro­duc­tion of the prin­ci­pal raw ma­te­rial — to­bacco leaf — re­mains broadly di­ver­si­fied across a num­ber of con­ti­nents. The in­dus­try has proven adept at deal­ing with sup­ply-side shocks”, stated BAT. On the other hand a re­search report by Grand View gives a growth out­look with re­gards to prof­itabil­ity and sales vol­ume in the sec­tor. The re­search report states that the global to­bacco mar­ket size was val­ued at US$932,11 bil­lion in 2020 and is ex­pected to ex­pand at a com­pound an­nual growth rate (CAGR) of 1,8% from 2021 to 2028. It has been ob­served that the num­ber of smok­ers has been ris­ing at the global level. This trend is fur­ther pro­pelled by the launch of new prod­ucts, in­clud­ing var­i­ous flavoured to­bacco prod­ucts such as clove cig­a­rettes and men­thol cigars. These fac­tors to­gether are ex­pected to drive the mar­ket over the next few years. More­over, over the past few years, with con­sumers grad­u­ally in­clin­ing to­ward smok­ing al­ter­na­tives, the in­tro­duc­tion of in­no­va­tive to­bacco prod­ucts in var­ied taste op­tions has be­come im­per­a­tive. As a re­sult, man­u­fac­tur­ers have fo­cused on pre­mium to­bacco prod­ucts pro­duced with flue-cured to­bacco and fine whole leaf. “Cig­a­rettes held the largest share of more than 75% in 2020. Over the past few years, the pop­u­lar­ity of grow­ing par­ty­ing and pub­bing cul­ture among work­ing-class pop­u­la­tions has pro­pelled the de­mand for var­i­ous flavoured and un­flavoured cig­a­rettes across the globe,’ the report states. “In ad­di­tion to this, emerg­ing economies such as In­dia, Thai­land and China are wit­ness­ing a de­cent rise in cig­a­rette de­mand due to ris­ing young­sters in these coun­tries. The next-gen­er­a­tion to­bacco prod­ucts seg­ment is an­tic­i­pated to be the fastest-grow­ing seg­ment with a CAGR of 2,8% from 2021 to 2028.” The report fur­ther points out that: “Ris­ing con­sumer pref­er­ence for less harm­ful to­bacco prod­ucts over cig­a­rettes can be at­trib­uted to the grow­ing need to live a healthy life­style. This has driven the de­mand for the con­sump­tion of next-gen­er­a­tion prod­ucts in the to­bacco sec­tor. “The North Amer­i­can mar­ket is gain­ing mo­men­tum and is an­tic­i­pated to wit­ness promis­ing growth in the de­mand for nextgen­er­a­tion prod­ucts ow­ing to the in­creas­ing con­sumer dis­pos­able in­come, ris­ing num­ber of prod­uct launches, and the avail­abil­ity of su­pe­rior-qual­ity prod­ucts” the report says. Ac­cord­ing to the report, the Mid­dle East and Africa re­gion is an­tic­i­pated to be the fastest-grow­ing re­gional mar­ket with a CAGR of 3% from 2021 to 2028. The re­gion has been wit­ness­ing con­sis­tent growth in the adop­tion of to­bacco con­sump­tion. Egyp­tian ado­les­cents make a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of this con­sumer seg­ment. A sig­nif­i­cant fac­tor con­tribut­ing to the adop­tion of these prod­ucts is the rel­a­tively low prices of to­bacco prod­ucts in Egypt. “The ris­ing con­sumer dis­pos­able in­come lev­els cou­pled with the wide avail­abil­ity of di­verse prod­uct ranges, in­clud­ing cig­a­rettes, snuff, shisha, etc, are aug­ment­ing the mar­ket for to­bacco prod­ucts in Africa,” the re­ports says. “Apart from this, the grow­ing con­sumer con­cerns to­wards the high preva­lence of nu­mer­ous res­pi­ra­tory dis­or­ders due to smok­ing to­bacco have led to a grad­ual shift to­wards chew­ing-based prod­uct al­ter­na­tives. “Fur­ther­more, the in­creas­ing pop­u­lar­ity of smoke­less to­bacco that con­tains higher nico­tine con­tent in com­par­i­son to cig­a­rettes is also pro­pel­ling the mar­ket growth in Africa. Ad­di­tion­ally, the ris­ing pen­e­tra­tion of nu­mer­ous in­ter­na­tional play­ers has led to the in­tro­duc­tion of so­phis­ti­cated prod­ucts in the mar­ket,” the report states. It points out that: “Sev­eral man­u­fac­tur­ers are launch­ing in­no­va­tive flavours, such as saf­fron, ap­ple, cin­na­mon, berry, etc, of to­bacco prod­ucts to at­tract a larger con­sumer base in the re­gion. “Be­sides this, the im­prov­ing con­sumer liv­ing stan­dards have led to the in­creas­ing per capita ex­pen­di­tures on pre­mium and high-qual­ity to­bacco prod­ucts, such as cigars and cigar­il­los. Look­ing for­ward, IMARC Group ex­pects the Africa to­bacco prod­ucts mar­ket to con­tinue its mod­er­ate growth dur­ing the next five years.” While cig­a­rette sales are ex­pand­ing to new mar­kets, in­dus­try mar­ket shares are con­sol­i­dat­ing and it is in­creas­ingly con­trolled by a few in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies. In 2001, a lit­tle more than 43% of global mar­ket sales were con­trolled by the five lead­ing transna­tional to­bacco com­pa­nies TTC. By 2017, 80,6% of the mar­ket was con­trolled by three TTCs. Over the last decade, the in­ter­na­tional cig­a­rette mar­ket has been dom­i­nated by five com­pa­nies: China Na­tional To­bacco Cor­po­ra­tion, Philip Mor­ris In­ter­na­tional, Bri­tish Amer­i­can To­bacco, Ja­pan To­bacco Inc. and Im­pe­rial To­bacco. Back to our do­mes­tic mar­ket, ac­cord­ing to FewsNet the 2020/21 to­bacco sea­son of­fi­cially started in early Septem­ber. In mid-Septem­ber, the To­bacco In­dus­try and Mar­ket­ing Board (TIMB) re­ported an al­most 60% de­cline in reg­is­tered farm­ers com­pared to last year. The re­duc­tion is mainly due to un­favourable pay­ment ar­range­ments dur­ing the 2019/20 sea­son. En­gage­ment in to­bacco pro­duc­tion, the main cash crop, will likely be lower than in re­cent years if the num­ber of reg­is­tered farm­ers re­mains be­low last year and av­er­age. Ac­cord­ing to the 2021 Na­tional Bud­get State­ment, the coun­try has ben­e­fited from growth in to­bacco pro­duc­tion over the re­cent years, thereby con­tribut­ing to for­eign cur­rency gen­er­a­tion, in­come and jobs. This pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment has, how­ever, come at a huge cost to the en­vi­ron­ment as most farm­ers de­pend on wood for cur­ing to­bacco. Gov­ern­ment des­ig­nated To­bacco Levy to ad­dress en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­ages caused by to­bacco farm­ing ac­tiv­i­ties. “There is a need for in­clu­sive stake­holder par­tic­i­pa­tion in plan­ning and im­ple­men­ta­tion of tree plant­ing pro­grammes so that the Fund can have an im­pact. In ad­di­tion, ef­forts should be made for stake­hold­ers in the in­dus­try to in­vest in im­proved to­bacco cur­ing tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing the use of coal in­stead of woods”, the bud­get state­ment said. A Study by R Chin­gosho at the Univer­sity of Cape Town ti­tled To­bacco farm­ing and cur­rent debt sta­tus among small­holder farm­ers in Man­i­ca­land prov­ince, re­vealed that an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of con­tract farm­ers, par­tic­u­larly in the Man­i­ca­land re­gion of the coun­try, are un­happy with the re­turns that they get from pro­duc­ing to­bacco. “The pol­icy im­pli­ca­tion of this study is that the gov­ern­ment should in­ter­vene to im­prove the eco­nomic con­di­tions of to­bacco farm­ers. For ex­am­ple, im­pos­ing some ‘mean­ing­ful’ price con­trol on to­bacco leaf would al­low farm­ers to get more rev­enue for their to­bacco crops and would im­prove their chances of break­ing out of the cy­cle of poverty.” Ma­pung­wana is a lo­cal in­de­pen­dent econ­o­mist and con­sul­tant.

zw,The Manica Post,20210219,What they don’t want you to know,"THE black-on-black vi­o­lence that typ­i­fies Zim­babwe and the rest of Africa — no mat­ter how sub­tle it is — man­i­fests in dif­fer­ent forms, for in­stance mob jus­tice, black un­der­min­ing, ha­rass­ing a fel­low black per­son in the work­place and un­war­ranted Twit­ter wars — which is the lat­est fash­ion for the cur­rent key­board gen­er­a­tion. These are just some of the signs of an in­fe­ri­or­ity com­plex and black self-hate. The af­fir­ma­tion of ‘black is beau­ti­ful’ there­fore finds it­self on slip­pery ground and can­not ex­actly res­onate with the black masses who seem to be­lieve that noth­ing good can come out of the African com­mu­nity. Yet this is com­ing at a time when poverty rates through­out the African con­ti­nent have been fall­ing steadily and much faster than pre­vi­ously thought, at least ac­cord­ing to the World Data Lab. In fact, Africa is among the world’s most rapidly grow­ing eco­nomic re­gions. But de­spite that, mi­cro-blog­ging site Twit­ter has ex­posed this self-hate in a seg­ment of the Zim­bab­wean com­mu­nity. Ap­par­ently, through white in­doc­tri­na­tion, it is pos­si­ble to hate your­self too much, to dis­like your iden­tify, your African­ness — and feel that you aren’t good enough. These thoughts can then lead to im­pulses to want to pun­ish your­self and self-dis­tract through ex­ag­ger­ated rant­ing about the sit­u­a­tion you find your­self in — per­ceived or real. This ex­plains why Zim Twit­ter, com­monly known as Zwit­ter, of­ten goes into over­drive when one of the key­board ‘war­riors’ dig up de­press­ing in­for­ma­tion or im­ages of a ‘poor’ Zim­babwe; and like a pen­du­lum swings to the other ex­treme of eerie si­lence when some­thing good is hap­pen­ing in the South­ern African na­tion. For ex­am­ple, as Air Zim­babwe’s Chi­man­i­mani grace­fully flew to China to ferry the first batch of the Sinopharm Covid-19 vac­cine early this week — way ahead of many other African coun­tries — our own Zim­bab­wean key­board war­riors chose to look the other way. In their si­lence, you could feel that they were not very happy that Zim­babwe had man­aged to se­cure those 200 000 doses so quickly. Com­pare that with the hype cre­ated around the im­age of a di­lap­i­dated ru­ral school in Gokwe or Chipinge and you will un­der­stand how self­hate thrives on con­stantly crit­i­cis­ing and judg­ing. When this hate takes over, you can al­most touch the eupho­ria as some­one talks about their own worth­less­ness and fail­ure as well as that of their kith. What a tragedy. The fo­cus is al­ways on the slums, the most mis­er­able en­vi­ron­ment as the neg­a­tive stereo­type of Zim­babwe as a nest of poverty is prop­a­gated. At the heart of it all is low self-es­teem. But maybe even more trag­i­cally, self-hate con­vinces the vic­tim that the peo­ple around them view them through the same dis­cern­ing lenses, hence the lack of con­fi­dence in telling the coun­try’s good news. But is poverty — in its very broad con­text con­sid­er­ing that so­ci­etal ex­pec­ta­tions dif­fer across civil­i­sa­tions — pe­cu­liar to Africa, par­tic­u­larly Zim­babwe, the small tea-pot shaped coun­try tucked south of the equa­tor? Since we hear so much about Zim­babwe’s ‘poverty’, is every­one in Europe, Asia and the Amer­i­cas liv­ing pretty? Do they all have enough food and clean wa­ter, as well as ac­cess to an ef­fi­cient health sys­tem and a com­fort­able bed, among other things? Un­for­tu­nately, the an­swer to that ques­tion is a re­sound­ing NO. Poverty is a global prob­lem that does not start and end in Zim­babwe. Ac­cord­ing to the Euro­pean Data Jour­nal­ism Net­work, 17 per­cent of Euro­peans are poor, that is 85 mil­lion in­hab­i­tants of the Old Con­ti­nent, al­though of course there are ma­jor dif­fer­ences be­tween coun­tries with oth­ers do­ing con­sid­er­ably well. And while beg­ging is com­mon­place in most big global cities, it seems syn­ony­mous with Paris, France. From the beg­gars at the metro sta­tions, the peo­ple who ap­proach you out­side restau­rants, to the fam­i­lies in bus shel­ters and those who play a song or write a poem in ex­change for some small change, the va­ri­ety and amount of beg­ging in Paris can be shock­ing. In the evening, the num­ber of home­less peo­ple around Paris Charles de Gaulle Air­port, the largest in­ter­na­tional air­port in France, is sad. In to­tal, there were around 8,8 mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing be­low the poverty line in France in 2017. But the pa­tri­otic French peo­ple pre­fer to keep it in-house as they mend their af­fairs. They have a true sense of iden­tity and an in­ti­mate con­science of unity and com­mon be­long­ing. But per­haps even more in­ter­est­ingly, poverty is so much higher in the United States than in other in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries. Re­gard­less of how poverty is mea­sured — the United States is at its high end. Whether we look at chil­dren’s poverty or the work­ing class, the story is the same. Yet data from the World Val­ues Sur­vey in­di­cates that 100 per­cent of all Amer­i­cans who are in the low­est in­come group are ei­ther very or quite proud of their coun­try. Then there is Madrid in Spain, Europe, where you will find a shanty set­tle­ment called Canada Real, one that makes Ep­worth’s Ma­ha­lape or Dangamvura’s Fed­er­a­tion lux­ury set­tle­ments. Sur­pris­ingly, these pa­tri­otic Spa­niards do not rush to their em­bassies chant­ing their coun­try’s deroga­tory songs, nei­ther do they talk about their dirty laun­dry in pub­lic. How a coun­try is por­trayed is there­fore a choice of its in­hab­i­tants. Fel­low Zim­bab­weans, in­stead of por­tray­ing a na­tion in tur­moil, we can choose to tell the world about the vast in­vest­ments op­por­tu­ni­ties in our coun­try; or how we are ex­tend­ing the olive branch to our for­mer foes in our re-en­gage­ment drive. Till next week, let’s chew the cud. Since we hear so much about Zim­babwe’s ‘poverty’, is every­one in Europe, Asia and the Amer­i­cas liv­ing pretty?

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201007,Whither Africa’s eco­nomic rights?,"THE 71st an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China was marked last week, com­ing on the back of mas­sive progress in all spheres made by the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant. As China moves ahead, and looks for­ward to more years of progress, it is im­por­tant that other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries take a se­ri­ous ex­am­i­na­tion of how the coun­try has man­aged to make a huge leap for­ward within a short pe­riod. Such lessons can be use­ful as fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, es­pe­cially those in Africa, in­sti­tute var­i­ous mea­sures to up­lift their cit­i­zens out of poverty. In fact, from around 800 mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing in poverty in 1980, China is left with only 5,5 mil­lion, who the au­thor­i­ties en­vis­age will no longer be liv­ing be­low the poverty da­tum line by the end of this year. Of course, meet­ing the tar­get could have been af­fected by Covid-19, which saw some peo­ple slid­ing back into poverty, but this does not mean it is no longer achiev­able. It is not only in poverty al­le­vi­a­tion where China has made as­ton­ish­ing progress, as it has man­aged to out­shine many other coun­tries in ar­eas like tech­nol­ogy, in­fras­truc­ture and in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment. China has achieved a tremen­dous trans­for­ma­tion in the last 71 years, es­pe­cially when it comes to cre­at­ing wealth and be­com­ing rich. What is im­por­tant about China’s progress is that it pro­vides an al­ter­na­tive to a de­vel­op­ment model to the one that has been pushed for cen­turies by Western coun­tries. Some of the prob­lems af­fect­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries now em­anate from colo­nial­ism, which some schol­ars and de­vel­op­ment the­o­rists blame for re­tard­ing growth in emerg­ing economies. Since the time of colo­nial­ism, the for­mer colonis­ers never pushed a devel­op­men­tal agenda with the pur­pose of help­ing peo­ple out of poverty. Colo­nial­ism seg­mented so­ci­eties, cre­at­ing con­di­tions of squalor for lo­cals so that they con­tin­ued to of­fer their labour for sur­vival. The colo­nial­ists, as rep­re­sented by Western coun­tries, have been present in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries for cen­turies, but their pre­scrip­tions for de­vel­op­ment have failed to bring joy to their for­mer colonies. This is why pro­grammes be­ing pushed by Western cre­ated in­sti­tu­tions like the eco­nomic struc­tural ad­just­ments are be­ing heav­ily crit­i­cised for their fail­ures. Many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are mov­ing away from such de­vel­op­ment pre­scrip­tions, choos­ing in­stead to turn to lo­cal and prac­ti­cal so­lu­tions else­where that are rel­e­vant to their prob­lems. In do­ing that, the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries can draw a lot of lessons from China’s progress. China is a fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­try, which used to have the same con­di­tions as ob­tain­ing in many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries not so long ago. This means the path it has fol­lowed in lift­ing its peo­ple out of poverty ap­pears the most vi­able route for other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, of course tak­ing only those as­pects which ap­ply to lo­cal con­di­tions. This has ig­nited the de­bate con­cern­ing the em­pha­sis the Western coun­tries are con­cen­trat­ing on as a pre­req­ui­site for de­vel­op­ment aid. These in­clude pri­vate cap­i­tal­ism, lib­eral democ­racy and po­lit­i­cal rights a sys­tem that worked per­fectly for Western coun­tries. But these have failed to bring food on the ta­ble of cit­i­zens in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries be­cause the more they pur­sue them, the more they ap­pear ab­stract and un­achiev­able. Un­der these po­lit­i­cal sys­tems, de­vel­op­ment has re­mained a mi­rage even for those de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that have tried to em­brace them hook, line and sinker. On the con­trary, China has suc­cess­fully pur­sued State cap­i­tal­ism, in­stead of pri­vate cap­i­tal­ism, guided democ­racy in­stead of lib­eral democ­racy and eco­nomic rights in­stead of po­lit­i­cal rights. Chi­nese lead­ers quickly re­alised the folly of as­sum­ing that hav­ing lib­eral democ­racy is the ul­ti­mate, hence their em­pha­sis on the econ­omy rather than pol­i­tics. What de­vel­op­ing coun­tries need at the moment is to con­cen­trate on de­vel­op­ing their economies be­cause that is the only way peo­ple’s lives can be im­proved. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has on sev­eral oc­ca­sions re­it­er­ated that Zim­babwe will now fo­cus more on the econ­omy and less on pol­i­tics. This stance is meant to shift the peo­ple’s at­ten­tion to tack­ling is­sues that re­ally mat­ter when it comes to im­prov­ing the con­di­tions of liv­ing. The moment de­vel­op­ing coun­tries put pol­i­tics on the back seat and con­cen­trate their en­ergy on the econ­omy is when they will start re­al­is­ing that even with their lit­tle ex­per­tise, they can ac­tu­ally start the process of mov­ing out of be­ing un­der­de­vel­oped. The em­pha­sis should now be more on eco­nomic rights, is­sues that bring food on the ta­ble through in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and moderni­sa­tion of economies. This can be done by study­ing the al­ter­na­tive . model of de­vel­op­ment that is be­ing of­fered to the world by China, which it used to pros­per to the lev­els of be­com­ing the sec­ond big­gest econ­omy in the world. The Western sys­tem, from the early days of the First In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion, has worked well for coun­tries in that re­gion, but it has failed to up­lift poor coun­tries out of poverty for cen­turies. The sys­tem has com­pletely failed to be repli­cated in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. In fact, at­tempts to ap­ply the Western de­vel­op­ment sys­tems have left poor coun­tries sink­ing deeper in poverty. But the emer­gence of China and other coun­tries known as the Asian Tigers has awak­ened de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to an al­ter­na­tive model of de­vel­op­ment that em­pha­sises on is­sues that re­ally mat­ter. De­vel­op­ing coun­tries are be­ing made to chase af­ter what ap­pears to their cit­i­zens as il­lu­sions. Build­ing strong economies should be a perquisite for achiev­ing democ­racy and po­lit­i­cal rights be­cause it is dif­fi­cult to sell an idea which has noth­ing to do with eco­nomic progress to peo­ple who are liv­ing in poverty. In­stead of be­ing per­pet­u­ally trapped in pol­i­tics and such ab­stract con­cepts like democ­racy, peo­ple in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are in­creas­ingly prod­ding their lead­ers to­wards con­cen­trat­ing on the econ­omy. As China marks its 71st an­niver­sary, it is clear that the progress it has made is out of the re­al­i­sa­tion that more em­pha­sis on the econ­omy brings qual­ity life as it tack­les is­sues like food se­cu­rity, ac­com­mo­da­tion, health­care and education. A good econ­omy of­fers much more than just po­lit­i­cal free­dom be­cause it speaks di­rectly to in­di­vid­ual needs. China has achieved a lot through this re­al­i­sa­tion, as peo­ple in other coun­tries can point to and ad­mire the progress made in roads, rail­ways, mod­ern tech­nol­ogy and the de­vel­op­ment of mod­ern in­fras­truc­ture. And in deal­ing with fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, China has been em­pha­sis­ing on what it terms “win­win” co­op­er­a­tion which en­sures all the side ben­e­fit from the deals be­ing made. If there is a de­vel­op­ment model which many coun­tries are now in­clined to­wards, it is that be­ing of­fered by China be­cause it is the near­est to ful­fill­ing the as­pi­ra­tions of the ma­jor­ity. It is not a mi­rage, but a sys­tem that man­aged to change China within a short pe­riod of time. Such an achieve­ment un­der a sys­tem to­tally dif­fer­ent from the Western prac­tice brings hope to fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that they can fol­low the Chi­nese ex­am­ple and achieve their dreams. Ul­ti­mately, a sys­tem that en­sures cre­ation of wealth within the short­est pe­riod of time is the one that will gain favour and trac­tion among peo­ple in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Al­most ev­ery­where you go in China, there are sky­scrapers, which sig­nify a boom­ing econ­omy and business in the Asian coun­try. China is well ad­vanced in tech­nol­ogy, with tech­no­log­i­cal hubs found in al­most ev­ery city, with ma­jor na­tional in­fras­truc­ture projects for sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210409,The Re­bound Series on cards,"HEART & Soul (H&S) Broad­cast­ing Ser­vices is launch­ing a brand new series that will delve into is­sues and chal­lenges af­fect­ing the main pil­lars of the Zim­bab­wean so­ci­ety, ti­tled The Re­bound Series. Join H&S as it ex­plores the ex­cit­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­babwe to once again be the envy of many. The hour long show will be a hard hit­ting so­lu­tions-driven pro­gramme an­chored by sea­soned broad­cast jour­nal­ist Farai Mwaku­tuya (FM). Zim­babwe In­de­pen­dent (ZI) sat down with Mwaku­tuya to dis­cuss the new ex­cit­ing pro­gramme. Be­low are ex­cerpts of the in­ter­view: ZI: Who is Farai Mwaku­tuya? FM: Farai Mwaku­tuya is an award win­ning jour­nal­ist with over 13 years ex­pe­ri­ence in the me­dia in­dus­try. I started my ca­reer in Zim­babwe in 1998 be­fore mov­ing to Uganda in 2007, where I worked for East Africa’s largest me­dia con­glom­er­ate Na­tion Me­dia Group, which has broad­cast, print and on­line me­dia in­ter­ests in all five East African com­mu­nity mem­ber states. I was a tele­vi­sion news an­chor and pre­sen­ter for Uganda’s most pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion sta­tion NTV Uganda. Apart from an­chor­ing the na­tion’s most pop­u­lar news bul­letin I hosted a weekly busi­ness pro­gramme Money Mat­ters. In 2011, I re­turned to Zim­babwe and was one of the found­ing pre­sen­ters on ZiFM Stereo dis­cussing wide rang­ing top­ics in­clud­ing busi­ness, min­ing, en­vi­ron­ment and par­lia­men­tary af­fairs. I won the Min­ing Re­porter of the Year Award in the an­nual Njama awards (2012). I am cur­rently an in­ter­na­tional cor­re­spon­dent for China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work. ZI: What is The Re­bound Series? Please give us a brief Syn­op­sis. FM: Right now ev­ery Zim­bab­wean is yearn­ing for a turn­around, be it the econ­omy or in so­cial ser­vice de­liv­ery. Some ar­gue that the coun­try is start­ing to do so. The Re­bound Series as the name sug­gests is about a coun­try that is re­turn­ing to its for­mer great past, and the show will seek to play a part in the re­build­ing process by show­cas­ing the things that need to be done in or­der to help it get there. The Re­bound Series is a high level talk show that will look at dif­fer­ent spheres of life from the econ­omy, health, ed­u­ca­tion, so­cial se­cu­rity, democ­racy and gov­er­nance, amongst many oth­ers. For an hour we will talk to dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers and the gen­eral pub­lic about the chal­lenges, op­por­tu­ni­ties and so­lu­tions. The key ques­tion that we’ll con­stantly ask is ‘how do we re­bound or re­cover as a na­tion’. Zim­babwe has po­ten­tial to re­bound and re­claim the sta­tus of be­ing the Jewel of the African Con­ti­nent. As we cel­e­brate the 41st In­de­pen­dence, let’s lay the foun­da­tion of a pros­per­ous coun­try by 2030. ZI: What does it aim to achieve? FM: The pro­gramme seeks to in­form and ed­u­cate, shape opin­ions and con­trib­ute to the craft­ing of pro­gres­sive poli­cies. There are so many de­vel­op­ments, both good and bad, hap­pen­ing in the coun­try right now and The Re­bound Series will dis­sect them crit­i­cally in or­der to cel­e­brate and en­hance those that are good and cor­rect or im­prove those that are neg­a­tive. The spirit of the de­bate on the show will be con­struc­tive as op­posed to de­struc­tive born out of the re­al­i­sa­tion that we (all Zim­bab­weans) are in this to­gether. ZI: Where will your guests be drawn from? FM: We want to talk to the pol­icy and de­ci­sion-mak­ers so we can un­der­stand their vi­sion and plans and also hold them to ac­count. We will also in­vite ex­perts and tech­nocrats in the dif­fer­ent spheres and sec­tors that we are go­ing to be dis­cussing. There is a huge repos­i­tory of knowl­edge and ex­per­tise amongst our view­ers and fol­low­ers and it is the role of the me­dia to iden­tify those re­sources to share what they know for the ben­e­fit of our coun­try. Some­times peo­ple feel that they do not get an op­por­tu­nity or have ac­cess to plat­forms that en­able them to prof­fer their ideas and so­lu­tions, which means we, as a na­tion, could be miss­ing out on very valu­able in­sights. So The Re­bound Series will make it a pri­or­ity to make sure that peo­ple who are knowl­edge­able and can add value, both at home and abroad, are heard. But be­yond the high level guests we also want to hear the voice of or­di­nary cit­i­zens who feel the im­pact of the poli­cies that are crafted and the things that are hap­pen­ing in our coun­try. They are im­por­tant stake­hold­ers be­cause they have a vested in­ter­est in the for­tunes of Zim­babwe so we will also give them a plat­form to air their views. So in short The Re­bound Series will be a melt­ing pot of views and ideas. ZI: There is a plethora of shows that dis­cuss cur­rent af­fairs and other top­i­cal is­sues in Zim­babwe. How is this one dif­fer­ent? FM: In­deed there are many cur­rent af­fairs pro­grammes on var­i­ous plat­forms, ex­actly the way it should be, be­cause it is im­por­tant for us to dis­cuss and talk about things ex­haus­tively if we are go­ing if we are to get the so­lu­tions we seek. At times though, we of­ten end up see­ing and hear­ing the same faces and voices and the same top­ics be­ing dis­cussed. The Re­bound Series is go­ing to add to much needed di­ver­sity by crit­i­cally as­sess­ing where we went wrong in cer­tain spheres and com­ing up with de­fin­i­tive and prac­ti­cal rec­om­men­da­tions on what needs to be done to get them back on track. We think that fin­ger point­ing is un­nec­es­sary and coun­ter­pro­duc­tive that we can make more mean­ing­ful progress if we en­gage in can­did and so­lu­tion and devel­op­ment ori­ented dis­course. Un­for­tu­nately, Zim­babwe is a po­larised na­tion and some­times the dis­cus­sions tak­ing place be­come over­shad­owed by the dif­fer­ences which de­tract from the value that view­ers would want to get from fol­low­ing the shows. The Re­bound Series will seek to rise above the dif­fer­ences and pro­vide sober analy­ses of is­sues and en­sure that we get the answers to the burn­ing ques­tions that peo­ple have. We also in­tend to make it a fully in­ter­ac­tive plat­form where peo­ple can share their opin­ions and have their say even be­yond the ac­tual pro­gramme has aired. ZI: Why did you agree to be part of this? FM: Af­ter sev­eral years in cur­rent af­fairs talk ra­dio I took a break due to frus­tra­tion about the fact that some­times dis­cus­sions de­gen­er­ated into party and per­son­al­ity bat­tles and that author­i­ties were not forth­com­ing with in­for­ma­tion. I was hugely ex­cited about this pro­gramme af­ter hear­ing the thrust, which was fu­ture ori­ented and so­lu­tions based. I also feel that it is per­fectly timed be­cause there is so much mis­in­for­ma­tion and mis­giv­ing about where we are as a na­tion. De­pend­ing on who you speak to, you would think that Zim­babwe is ei­ther the most des­o­late out­post where poverty, law­less­ness reigns or that it’s a utopian land of milk and honey. We are nei­ther of the two but I am not sure ex­actly where we are. The prospect of find­ing out the eco­nomic and so­cial state of Zim­babwe is a big mo­ti­va­tion for me to present this show where I in­tend to get the answers and in­for­ma­tion that will let us know where we stand and what we need to do to move for­ward. I also think it is a great op­por­tu­nity to bring to­gether some of the best minds in Zim­babwe and the di­as­pora to cre­ate the fu­ture Zim­babwe that all us de­sire.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190314,Africa could learn a lot from China,"Africans ac­count for a sig­nif­i­cantly high num­ber of peo­ple wal­low­ing in poverty world­wide, whether one uses the Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct or pur­chas­ing power par­ity as key stan­dards of mea­sure­ment. Erad­i­cat­ing ex­treme poverty should there­fore be the pri­or­ity of African gov­ern­ments. Africans have to find their own ways of do­ing so to meet the num­ber one goal of the Sus­tainaUN ble Devel­op­ment Goals by 2030. How­ever, Africa can learn some les­sons from China. The Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress and the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence gath­ered last week in Bei­jing for the Two Ses­sions to re­view gov­ern­ment’s per­for­mance in the past year. China has sin­gle- hand­edly re­duced ab­so­lute poverty by 66,6 per­cent since it opened up its econ­omy in 1978. This has up­lifted 700 mil­lion Chi­nese from poverty, mak­ing it the first coun­try to meet the Sus­tain­able Goals. UN The Chi­nese lead­er­ship has set clear tar­gets backed by poli­cies and re­sources to erad­i­cate ab­so­lute poverty by next year, which will make China a moder­ately pros­per­ous na­tion by 2049. In 2003, Heads of State and AU Gov­ern­ment iden­ti­fied agri­cul­ture as a key pri­or­ity for devel­op­ment, lead­ing to the adop­tion of the Maputo Dec­la­ra­tion on Agri­cul­ture and Food Se­cu­rity. Hence­forth, the Com­pre­hen­sive African Agri­cul­ture Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme re­quired African gov­ern­ments to in­vest at least 10 per­cent of their na­tional bud­gets in agri­cul­ture. The Mal­abo Dec­la­ra­tion Prin­ci­ples set 2025 as the year in which Africa will elim­i­nate ab­so­lute poverty. It is clear that Africa will not meet this self-im­posed tar­get. Although there is no­table progress in the per­for­mance of many African coun­tries, poverty re­mains high. This means that African lead­ers ought to be be­yond mak­ing dec­la­ra­tions and tar­gets that they can­not achieve. The lack of dis­ci­pline, re­sources, po­lit­i­cal will, pol­icy and reg­u­la­tory frame­works are some of the rea­sons for poverty alle­vi­a­tion tar­gets not be­ing met. If left un­abated, poverty will bring to a halt all other ef­forts to de­velop Africa. China has won the bat­tle against poverty be­cause the lead­er­ship mo­bilised the na­tion backed up by clear poli­cies, re­sources, set­ting re­al­is­tic tar­gets and, more im­por­tantly, dis­ci­pline. This is what ap­pears to be lack­ing in Africa. Africa is rich in hu­man cap­i­tal, min­eral re­sources and fer­tile land. It is time Africans take a tough stance on the qual­ity of their lead­ers. Africa must pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to anti- cor­rup­tion ef­forts and re­di­rect all re­sources to the bat­tle against poverty. African cit­i­zens de­serve an en­abling en­vi­ron­ment that ap­pre­ci­ates merit and does not frus­trate their ef­forts. It would help suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments to test the merit of some ini­tia­tives started un­der the aus­pices of pre­vi­ous gov­ern­ments. Con­sis­tency and sta­bil­ity have been cru­cial to China’s rise. Africa could learn from that. When Deng Xiaop­ing, the ar­chi­tect of China’s mir­a­cle, fa­mously pop­u­larised that apho­rism “cross­ing the river by feel­ing the stones”, he meant that the fu­ture is preg­nant with un­cer­tainty and China was well coun­selled to re­main grounded. An­other pos­si­ble in­ter­pre­ta­tion of this say­ing is that any ini­tia­tive that a coun­try weaves in its search to end poverty and sur­mount chal­lenges has to emerge from the coun­try’s spe­cific con­text. Un­for­tu­nately, Africa has failed dis­mally in this re­gard be­cause of pol­icy sus­cep­ti­bil­ity. The chronic de­pen­dence on min­eral ex­port is one fac­tor that un­der­mined the util­i­sa­tion of Africa’s most durable re­sources: its peo­ple and land. We can learn from China’s recog­ni­tion of adapt­ing poli­cies to lo­cal cir­cum­stances. Poverty can be ended by em­pow­er­ing Africans in all facets, di­ver­si­fy­ing economies to­wards land, and en­sur­ing that re­spon­sive lead­er­ships are in power. — News. IOL",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200505,China must pay repa­ra­tions to Africa for its coron­avirus fail­ures,"THE COVID-19 pan­demic has dealt a se­vere blow to Africa’s de­vel­op­ment prospects and wors­ened the con­di­tions of its poor and vul­ner­a­ble. Al­though there are calls for vol­un­tary in­ter­na­tional aid to sup­port the con­ti­nent dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time, this is far from the best so­lu­tion. The con­ti­nent must be ac­corded dam­ages and li­a­bil­ity com­pen­sa­tion from China, the rich and pow­er­ful coun­try that failed to trans­par­ently and ef­fec­tively man­age this global catas­tro­phe. Africa’s eco­nomic gains since the last global crisis have been eroded. It is time to make of­fend­ing rich coun­tries pay the poor ones a global risk bur­den tax for de­lay­ing their rise out of poverty. To­day, Africa is home to more than 70% of the world’s poor­est peo­ple, with more than 400 mil­lion liv­ing be­low the poverty line. It is no sur­prise that it is dis­pro­por­tion­ately vul­ner­a­ble to this crisis. It should not suf­fer even more be­cause yet an­other pow­er­ful coun­try failed to act re­spon­si­bly. China should im­me­di­ately an­nounce a com­plete write-off of the more than $140 bil­lion that its gov­ern­ment, banks and con­trac­tors ex­tended to coun­tries in Africa be­tween 2000 and 2017. This would pro­vide par­tial com­pen­sa­tion to African coun­tries for the im­pact that the coron­avirus is al­ready hav­ing on their economies and peo­ple. The anal­y­sis of the bal­ance of com­pen­sa­tion due to Africa can then fol­low from dis­cus­sions with the Africa Union and its mem­ber coun­tries, along­side global and re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions in­clud­ing the United Na­tions, the World Bank, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, the African De­vel­op­ment Bank and the Euro­pean Union. Our world is long over­due for a change of ap­proach in the way it man­ages global risks that leave the poor worse off due to fail­ures of the rich and pow­er­ful. The cur­rent model of de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance is bro­ken and can never de­liver any real change of for­tune for the most vul­ner­a­ble. We need a new model that strength­ens peo­ple to en­gage in the de­sign of their path­way out of poverty and builds eco­nomic re­silience. The cur­rent con­di­tions mir­ror what hap­pened dur­ing the 2008 global fi­nan­cial crisis. In my time as the vice-pres­i­dent in charge of the World Bank’s op­er­a­tions in Africa, we had to mo­bilise in­ter­nal and part­ner re­sources to mit­i­gate the sever­ity of the eco­nomic re­ces­sion suf­fered by the con­ti­nent. Ex­oge­nous shocks dealt a lethal blow to the coun­tries’ decade-long steady rises of eco­nomic growth, which had av­er­aged 5 to 6% an­nu­ally un­til tum­bling to 2,4% in 2009. This sharp fall ended Africa’s up­ward eco­nomic growth tra­jec­tory and sent per capita in­come tum­bling. It in­creased in­equal­ity and the num­ber of Africans in ab­so­lute poverty. Such frag­ile and low eco­nomic growth rates for a con­ti­nent with one of the world’s high­est con­cen­tra­tions of young peo­ple and an an­nual pop­u­la­tion growth rate of about 2,5% is a key rea­son for wide­spread mul­ti­di­men­sional poverty — a threat that car­ries seeds of global in­se­cu­rity and in­sta­bil­ity. he eco­nomic shock caused by the coron­avirus has badly re­duced the op­por­tu­nity Africa would oth­er­wise have had to lift hun­dreds of millions out of poverty. The African Union Com­mis­sion es­ti­mates that Africa’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct will shrink by as much as 4,5%, re­sult­ing in 20 mil­lion job losses. This has dan­ger­ously ham­pered the pos­si­bil­ity that Africa can gen­er­ate jobs for young peo­ple and women, or in­crease lit­er­acy lev­els by re­duc­ing the num­ber of out-of-school chil­dren with ac­cess to qual­ity learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. It will re­sult in less­ened abil­ity to re­duce ma­ter­nal and child mor­tal­ity, im­prove nutri­tion and food se­cu­rity, make re­li­able en­ergy avail­able and ac­ces­si­ble, im­prove the avail­abil­ity of qual­ity roads, wa­ter, san­i­ta­tion, and other in­fra­struc­ture, and such other in­vest­ments in pub­lic goods. China, a coun­try that only within the past four decades has man­aged to lift more than 850 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, would un­der­stand how crit­i­cal it is for African coun­tries to ac­cel­er­ate in­clu­sive growth. While economies in Asia, Europe and the Amer­i­cas have an­nounced hefty emer­gency stim­u­lus pack­ages for their peo­ple and busi­nesses, coun­tries in Africa strug­gle to meet short-term food needs. Most of Africa’s coun­tries sim­ply do not have the buf­fer re­quired for fis­cal re­lief in times of crisis, be­cause they were al­ready se­verely con­strained by bud­getary crises caused by poor do­mes­tic rev­enue mo­bil­i­sa­tion, high pub­lic debts and low pro­duc­tiv­ity. The par­lous pub­lic fi­nances of these coun­tries wors­ened due to volatil­ity in com­mod­ity prices as the pan­demic wors­ened. Africa faces fre­quent shocks caused by cli­mate, ter­ror­ism, health is­sues, food in­se­cu­rity, crime and other sources of risk. Most of these per­ils em­anate from the fail­ures of the rich and pow­er­ful economies, but end up in­flict­ing a dis­pro­por­tion­ate share of the poor and vul­ner­a­ble. China should demon­strate world lead­er­ship by ac­knowl­edg­ing its fail­ure to be trans­par­ent on COVID-19. Bei­jing’s lead­er­ship should then com­mit to an in­de­pen­dent ex­pert panel eval­u­a­tion of its pan­demic re­sponse. China and the rest of the Group of 20 coun­tries should en­gage with the Africa Union and coun­tries to de­sign a repa­ra­tions mech­a­nism. It is time for rich economies to show that our world is ca­pa­ble of do­ing right for the poor and vul­ner­a­ble. China must pay. ● Obi­ageli “Oby” Ezek­we­sili is the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent for the Africa re­gion at the World Bank and for­mer Min­is­ter of Ed­u­ca­tion for Nige­ria.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210323,Why Chi­nese model has not ben­e­fited Africa,"DI­VERSE views have been ex­pressed about the Chi­nese so­cio-po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic model. These range from the Chi­nese them­selves who, of course, un­crit­i­cally praise their sys­tem as a fault­less model, their com­peti­tors in the West who con­demn it out­right as rep­re­hen­si­ble and un­de­sir­able, and Africans who are of mixed, con­fused and un­thought-out emo­tions. Some folks from the con­ti­nent, who are un­ques­tion­ing dis­ci­ples of the mar­ket, naively, un­sci­en­tif­i­cally and prim­i­tively de­nounce the Chi­nese model pri­mar­ily on be­half of their Western as­so­ci­ates or be­cause of their ter­ri­ble ex­pe­ri­ences with, and or fears of, a dis­em­pow­er­ing and cor­rupt one-party State. This dis­parag­ing and dis­dain­ful African at­ti­tude is ex­ac­er­bated by the par­a­sitic and self-serv­ing na­ture of some of the cur­rent (and past) Chi­nese busi­ness ex­pe­di­tions on the con­ti­nent. “The Bei­jing model is a non-starter. It leads to a cor­rupt one-party State. That sys­tem is evil. In any case, look at how the Chi­nese are short-chang­ing us in busi­ness deals on the con­ti­nent.” That is the African pon­tif­i­cat­ing in both ig­no­rance and de­spair, ad nau­seum, ad in­fini­tum. Most Africans who de­fend, eu­lo­gise and em­brace the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sys­tems are usu­ally un­re­pen­tant despots with an in­sa­tiable affin­ity for un­demo­cratic prac­tices, the one-party State sys­tem, mis­gov­er­nance and cor­rup­tion. They have an in­or­di­nate lust for au­to­cratic power and un­re­servedly de­spise ac­count­abil­ity, trans­parency and good gov­er­nance. In their wicked and per­verted minds, the Chi­nese model would de­liver good­ies to ful­fil their self-in­ter­ests as po­lit­i­cal elites. How­ever, they do not ex­press their di­a­bolic in­ten­tions pub­licly. In­stead, they say: “De­vel­op­ment is more im­por­tant than democ­racy. Let us fol­low the Chi­nese way and attain rad­i­cal eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. We must pick up les­sons from China.” Of course, learn­ing from China is what they do not do. Well, both groups of Africans are wrong in their assess­ment of the Chi­nese model. Their cri­tiques are as un­sound as they are un­sci­en­tific. In­deed, there is poverty and a dearth of anal­y­sis with re­spect to the ef­fi­cacy of the Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sys­tems. China and Africa: The state of play Right from the start, let us state the sum­marised fac­tual and em­pir­i­cal po­si­tion which we can then demon­strate and ex­plain in the en­su­ing dis­cus­sion. The Chi­nese model has worked for China and the Chi­nese peo­ple. There is no ques­tion about that. How­ever, no African coun­try has been able to repli­cate this model in its en­tirety ef­fec­tively. Hence, no African coun­try has un­locked any of the pos­i­tive at­tributes that China has en­joyed. Fur­ther­more, Chi­nese busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties on the con­ti­nent have largely failed to ad­vance African economies. In some cases, the Chi­nese have ru­ined African economies by egre­gious nat­u­ral re­source strip­ping with­out ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion, ruinous fi­nanc­ing ar­range­ments and sup­port­ing and sus­tain­ing despotic regimes. Hence, the Chi­nese model has nei­ther ben­e­fited Africa as a trans­portable de­vel­op­men­tal model nor as a ba­sis for com­mer­cial diplo­macy, trade and eco­nomic part­ner­ship. Yes, the Chi­nese model and ac­tiv­i­ties have not and will not likely ben­e­fit Africa in the fu­ture. Yes, African State cap­i­tal­ism (ef­forts to repli­cate the Chi­nese model) has failed in Africa. These are fair ob­ser­va­tions. How­ever, one can­not judge the Chi­nese model by African's fail­ure to repli­cate it. There are good rea­sons why this de­con­tex­tu­alised adop­tion of the model has been un­suc­cess­ful. More im­por­tantly, the Chi­nese re­la­tion­ship with Africa post-lib­er­a­tion has been, for the most part, par­a­sitic and self-serv­ing. This has dam­aged Africa while ben­e­fit­ing China. You can­not blame China for that. We must blame our­selves. The Chi­nese folks com­ing to do busi­ness in post-in­de­pen­dent Africa are not the com­rades of Chair­man Mao's era. They are shrewd busi­ness­peo­ple, in most cases shrewder and savvier than their Western coun­ter­parts. They are vi­ciously and mer­ci­lessly chas­ing cash. The Chi­nese in Africa are not fa­ther Christ­mas. There is no love, com­rade­ship or char­ity in­volved. Just cash. If Africa is dis­or­gan­ised, does not put to­gether a ca­pa­ble tech­no­cratic team se­lected on merit, it will be shafted by the Chi­nese. They do not think twice about tak­ing ad­van­tage of an in­com­pe­tent and des­per­ate gov­ern­ment. When that hap­pens, why do we blame the Chi­nese? We must blame our in­cor­ri­gi­bly, in­com­pe­tent and cor­rupt selves. Even the so-called do­na­tions from China to African coun­tries are not ex­actly free. Each free­bie is tied to a com­mer­cial sale in which the African has no say on the unit price. The fool­ish Africans end up pay­ing more than they would have paid if it were a purely com­mer­cial trans­ac­tion. Sad. Tragic. The cur­rent COVID-19 vac­cine do­na­tions and sales to African coun­tries are a good demon­stra­tion of this malfea­sance — the Chi­nese mis­chief. More sig­nif­i­cantly, why are we ap­proach­ing China as small, frag­mented States with­out bar­gain­ing power? We must not en­gage China as in­di­vid­ual coun­tries. No. We are too small to un­lock any mean­ing­ful eco­nomic value as in­di­vid­ual na­tions. We get short-changed. Even South Africa, with 58,6 mil­lion peo­ple and a US$351 bil­lion GDP, is too small to en­gage with China mean­ing­fully. The same ap­plies to Nige­ria, with its pop­u­la­tion of 201 mil­lion and a GDP of US$448 bil­lion. We must en­gage with China as one con­ti­nen­tal eco­nomic bloc — the African Union (AU) and its African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). This is a colos­sal econ­omy con­sist­ing of a pop­u­la­tion and mar­ket of 1,3 bil­lion Africans, a po­ten­tial GDP of US$2,5 tril­lion and a mas­sive col­lec­tive re­source base.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161208,Un­pack­ing China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion strat­egy,"NOT so long ago, most Chi­nese peo­ple would ask each other: Ni chi le ma? (Have you eaten?), in­stead of: Ni hao ma? (How are you?). This was the time when Chi­nese cit­i­zens were wal­low­ing in so much poverty that their ma­jor con­cern was get­ting some­thing to eat. The lan­guage de­vel­oped as neigh­bours be­gan to feel for each other and re­flected the plague of poverty that was be­dev­illing Chi­nese so­ci­ety at the time. This was be­fore the Asian coun­try em­barked on a de­lib­er­ate pro­gramme to up­lift its cit­i­zens out of poverty from 1978. To­day, China’s re­mark­able poverty alle­vi­a­tion strat­egy has been cred­ited for be­ing one of the best ex­am­ples in the world. The strat­egy has been dubbed the “world mir­a­cle” by some and has shown that with unity of pur­pose, coun­tries can suc­cess­fully elim­i­nate poverty. The World Bank notes that due to China’s ef­fec­tive poverty alle­vi­a­tion pro­gramme, 500 mil­lion peo­ple were lifted out of poverty by 2012, as the rate fell from 88 per­cent in 1981 to 6,5 per­cent. Lat­est statis­tics show that more than 700 mil­lion peo­ple in China are now liv­ing a poverty-free life, while only 50 mil­lion are still fac­ing the prob­lem. The Asian coun­try has set a tar­get to wipe out poverty among the re­main­ing 50 mil­lion peo­ple by 2020, which means China will have to­tally elim­i­nated poverty in the next four years. The peo­ple still liv­ing in poverty are mainly in the ru­ral ar­eas and in eth­nic mi­nor­ity ar­eas, which are of­ten moun­tain­ous and need more re­sources for poverty alle­vi­a­tion pro­jects to be un­der­taken. China’s mas­sive poverty alle­vi­a­tion pro­gramme started with the Third Ple­nary Ses­sion of the Eleventh Cen­tral Com­mit­tee of the Com­mu­nist Party of China held in De­cem­ber 1978. Huang Cheng­wei in his book “China’s Poverty Alle­vi­a­tion Op­er­a­tions” notes that be­fore the re­form and open­ing up pol­icy was adopted at that meet­ing, China was con­fronted with wide­spread poverty char­ac­terised by harsh liv­ing and work­ing con­di­tions. Statis­tics Huang pro­vided show that in 1978, China’s per capita Gross Na­tional Prod­uct was only $632, at least 10 per­cent of the world’s av­er­age level and 34 per­cent of the av­er­age level in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. But that 1978 CPC ple­nary ses­sion opened the way for China’s fight against poverty as it marked the start of the coun­try’s de­lib­er­ate pol­icy to open up to world cap­i­tal. The re­form and open­ing up pol­icy is cred­ited for China’s rapid and as­ton­ish­ing in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process, as in­vestors flocked to the Asian coun­try. Ex­pan­sive ur­ban ar­eas, sup­ported by in­dus­tries and other so­cial ser­vices, started sprout­ing up in China, thereby cre­at­ing the much-needed em­ploy­ment. The gov­ern­ment in­tro­duced free ed­u­ca­tion, which helped those in poverty who could not af­ford to pro­ceed to higher lev­els. The free ed­u­ca­tion ac­counted for the ex­perts who helped drive the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process. With the mas­sive in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, China’s ur­ban poverty had al­most dis­ap­peared by the end of the 1990s. This left the ma­jor­ity of the poor liv­ing in the ru­ral ar­eas. The ma­jor eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in the ru­ral ar­eas is agri­cul­ture and it fol­lowed that the panacea to poverty alle­vi­a­tion there was to re­form the sec­tor. Agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment was given the same pri­or­ity sta­tus as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. This was be­ing done with the ul­ti­mate goal of es­tab­lish­ing so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics. Taxes, which had ex­isted for cen­turies in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, were re­moved as a way of im­prov­ing the sta­tus of the farm­ers. Ar­eas most af­fected by poverty were tar­geted in such pro­grammes, where agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment were given a pri­or­ity. The mod­erni­sa­tion of agri­cul­ture re­sulted in the im­prove­ment of farm­ers’ skills through prac­ti­cal agri­cul­tural tech­no­log­i­cal train­ing. Ru­ral tourism was an­other move which played a ma­jor role in poverty alle­vi­a­tion in China’s ru­ral ar­eas. Peo­ple, with the help of the gov­ern­ment, were urged to de­velop tourist at­trac­tions in their lo­cal­i­ties and up­grade their homes to cater for tourists. This pro­gramme is work­ing so per­fectly in places like Wu­long County, where ru­ral tourism earned more than 200 mil­lion yuan (al­most $30 mil­lion) in 2012. But most of the credit for up­lift­ing peo­ple from poverty in ru­ral ar­eas goes to mea­sures taken in im­prov­ing agri­cul­ture. Apart from mech­a­ni­sa­tion, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment en­cour­aged di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the sec­tor. This was sup­ported by land re­form, which took land from col­lec­tives — that oper­ated like co­op­er­a­tives — to in­di­vid­ual house­holds. The house­holds be­came more re­spon­si­ble for pro­duc­tion, as com­pared to col­lec­tives where peo­ple worked in groups. An anal­y­sis done by the gov­ern­ment re­vealed that the 42,2 per­cent out­put growth in agri­cul­ture be­tween 1978 and 1984 was at­trib­ut­able to such land re­forms. And 97 per­cent of the pro­duc­tiv­ity growth was di­rectly be­cause of the re­form of agri­cul­ture from col­lec­tivi­sa­tion to house­hold own­er­ship. In a bid to en­cour­age more farm­ers to in­crease pro­duc­tion, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment also re­formed the pric­ing sys­tem for crops to be­come more at­trac­tive. Records show that from the be­gin­ning of 1979, prices of grain were in­creased by 20,9 per­cent, oil crops 23,9 per­cent, cot­ton 17 per­cent, sugar crops 21,9 per­cent and pork 24,3 per­cent. To al­le­vi­ate poverty in moun­tain­ous ar­eas like Guangxi and Guizhou in south­ern China, pro­grammes such as Food-for-Work were started to en­cour­age the de­vel­op­ment of in­fra­struc­ture. A doc­u­men­tary ti­tled “An Open China, Colour­ful Guizhou, Global Vi­sion”, shown to diplo­mats and the me­dia in Bei­jing on Tues­day, in­di­cated that the prov­ince is now catch­ing up in poverty alle­vi­a­tion. Diplo­mats from dif­fer­ent con­ti­nents ad­dressed the guests and pledged to in­vite in­vestors from their coun­tries to Guizhou. What is im­por­tant in China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion pro­gramme is that it has the po­lit­i­cal back­ing at the high­est level. In June 2015, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping went to Hua­mao Vil­lage in Guizhou to in­spect the lo­cal poverty re­duc­tion ef­forts. He praised the lo­cal gov­ern­ment for pre­serv­ing the essence of the area, while de­vel­op­ing the econ­omy. In other ar­eas, the poverty re­duc­tion pro­gramme in­cludes the re­lo­ca­tion of peo­ple from bar­ren lands. One such ex­am­ple is in Ningxia Hui Au­tonomous re­gion, where fam­i­lies liv­ing in moun­tain­ous ar­eas, where they strug­gle for land, wa­ter and pas­tures, are be­ing re­lo­cated. A re­cent visit to the area by a group of African jour­nal­ists re­vealed that the pro­gramme is a huge suc­cess. At their new set­tle­ment near Yinchuan City, the cap­i­tal of Ningxia, the fam­i­lies are pro­vided with a mod­ern house, a green­house and train­ing in mod­ern and tech­ni­cal farm­ing meth­ods. So­cial ser­vices like a school and a hospi­tal have also been estab­lished to cater for the re­lo­cated fam­i­lies. China’s western prov­inces are the most af­fected by poverty and the gov­ern­ment has de­vised a pol­icy of pair­ing the much de­vel­oped east­ern prov­inces with those in the west. The de­vel­oped prov­inces are ex­pected to com­mit re­sources to help the un­de­vel­oped prov­inces which they are paired with. Bei­jing has been paired with In­ner Mon­go­lia, Tian­jin–Gansu, Shan­dong– Xin­jiang, Zhe­jiang–Sichuan and Guang­dong – Guangxi, Dalian, Qing­dao, Ningbo and Shen­zen will help Guizhou, Shangai–Yun­nan, Liaon­ing–Qing­hai, Jiangsu– Shanxi, Fu­jian–Ningxia, and Xi­a­men and Zhuhai–Chongqing. For­mer Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Deng Xiaop­ing, who is cred­ited with cre­at­ing the new China, pro­nounced that in the open­ing up and re­form process, re­gions which got pros­per­ous first should help those still in poverty. This, he said, would en­sure that ev­ery­one in China achieves a com­mon pros­per­ity. China’s poverty alle­vi­a­tion poli­cies are an­chored on the Poverty Re­duc­tion Pro­gramme (1994-2000), the First Ten-Year Poverty Re­duc­tion Pro­gramme (2001-2010) and the Sec­ond Ten-Year Poverty Re­duc­tion Pro­gramme (20112020).",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210306,Chi­nese in­flu­ence on African tech too huge,"CHINA has a well-es­tab­lished pres­ence on the African con­ti­nent. On the pos­i­tive side, a lot of in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment tak­ing place is a di­rect re­sult of Chi­nese fund­ing. In ad­di­tion, sev­eral big Chi­nese com­pa­nies have taken root in Africa be­com­ing sig­nif­i­cant con­trib­u­tors to em­ploy­ment and gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP). Ex­am­ples in­clude Citic Con­struc­tions, Sun­shine group, and FAW. Mck­in­sey and Com­pany re­search group es­ti­mates that in 2012 there were over 10 000 Chi­nese-owned com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing in Africa, the num­ber has since in­creased. How­ever, there has long been sus­pi­cion around Chi­nese fund­ing, es­pe­cially through debt as most deals are shrouded in mys­tery and hid­den be­hind closed doors. One ex­am­ple is Zam­bia's cur­rent debt co­nun­drum, in which re­ports in­di­cate the coun­try owes China large sums of money, but cir­cum­stances around the debt are un­clear in terms of the du­ra­tion and the cost. Ad­di­tion­ally, in­di­ca­tions are that some of the debt fa­cil­i­ties come with col­lat­er­alised ar­range­ments in which Africa mort­gages fu­ture re­sources for funds. This has raised ques­tions of whether Chi­nese lend­ing is not a ploy to take over the con­ti­nent. Re­gard­less of the sen­ti­ments and is­sues sur­round­ing the debt is­suances, China has a large foot­print on the con­ti­nent. Apart from fund­ing and in­fra­struc­ture, China is a sig­nif­i­cant trade part­ner for African economies. An­other ma­jor area in which the Chi­nese have shown dom­i­nance on the con­ti­nent is on the tech­nol­ogy front. A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture runs on Chi­nese backed tech­nol­ogy net­works with firms like china Tele­coms, Huawei and ZTE pro­vid­ing the core sys­tems for tech in­fra­struc­ture across the con­ti­nent. On the hard­ware front, Chi­nese phones have clipped a huge chunk of the mar­ket share. Trans­sion, the man­u­fac­turer of Itel, Tecno and In­finix brands, has clinched a size­able per­cent­age of the mar­ket. Other Chi­nese brands like Huawei have also es­tab­lished a solid pres­ence. If the African tech land­scape was a bat­tle­ground for dom­i­nance, the Chi­nese are cer­tainly emerg­ing vic­to­ri­ous. West­ern tech firms now lag be­hind Chi­nese firms. Africa has lagged be­hind in terms of mod­ern com­mu­ni­ca­tion for years. Given that per­ti­nent is­sues like poverty and Aids were the cen­tre fo­cus, is­sues of de­vel­op­ing in­fra­struc­ture took a back burner In more re­cent years, con­nec­tiv­ity be­came an im­por­tant tool for eco­nomic growth. The Chi­nese be­came a so­lu­tion by pro­vid­ing cheaper ac­cess to in­fra­struc­ture. Set­ting up sys­tems some­times from the ground up, Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy pro­vided the back­bone for mod­ern com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tems in most of Africa. On top of that ac­cess to smart­phones has be­come eas­ier and cheaper. More­over, Chi­nese com­pa­nies like Trans­sion have de­vel­oped phones that ap­peal to the African mar­ket; cost-ef­fec­tive with long bat­tery life. The United States has ef­fec­tively black­listed Chi­nese firm Huawei, cit­ing es­pi­onage as the rea­son for do­ing so. They ar­gued that Huawei was be­ing used by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties to spy through back­doors and other soft­ware em­bed­ded in the net­work's in­fra­struc­ture and the Huawei phones. Huwai ve­he­mently de­nied be­ing a proxy of the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. Where the cards fall on that mat­ter is still up to the courts. How­ever, it does bring into ques­tion the safety of the Chi­nese in­fra­struc­ture. Can it per­haps be used to spy in an at­tempt to fur­ther es­tab­lish dom­i­nance? This also brings to the fore the is­sue of Chi­nese tech-pow­ered Smart cities in Africa. In 2018, Huawei said it would give US$1,5 bil­lion for smart cities in Africa with Huawei play­ing a cen­tral role in build­ing their ecosys­tems in­clud­ing se­cu­rity sys­tems, sys­tems for con­trol­ling com­mu­ni­ca­tion and in­tel­li­gent video sur­veil­lance. These cities such as Konza tech­nol­ogy city in Kenya and Nige­ria's Yaba­con val­ley and are based on ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence sys­tems meant to make African cities more se­cure and safer with so­phis­ti­cated sur­veil­lance sys­tems. Could it be that these cities can be ma­nip­u­lated to fur­ther the Chi­nese agenda? Or as oth­ers have in­di­cated be used as tools in the hands of African gov­ern­ments to in­crease their grip on cit­i­zens? The Chi­nese are mov­ing to cre­ate the dig­i­tal silk road to the 21st cen­tury through 5G tech­nol­ogy. This silk road in­volves rolling out dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture and satel­lite cov­er­age that con­nects coun­tries and fi­nan­cial sys­tems along its route. Ex­change",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170624,China keen to end poverty in Africa,"DE­VEL­OP­MENT ex­perts on Wed­nes­day lauded China for its role in help­ing Africa fight poverty, but warned coun­tries on the con­ti­nent to se­lect only as­pects from the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant which ap­ply to their lo­cal sit­u­a­tions. The ex­perts were speak­ing at a two­day China-Africa High Level Di­a­logue and Think Tank Fo­rum which was of­fi­cially opened by Chi­nese For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Wang Yi here un­der the theme “Fight­ing against poverty for com­mon pros­per­ity”. Draw­ing ex­pe­ri­ences from Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s book “Up and Out of Poverty”, the de­vel­op­ment ex­perts, some from Zim­babwe, said it was im­por­tant for African lead­ers to in­stil con­fi­dence in in­vestors. Mr Wang said African coun­tries should con­sider de­vel­op­ment fea­tures that suited their con­di­tions and re­al­i­ties. “Poverty al­le­vi­a­tion re­quires a change of at­ti­tude,” he said. “De­vel­op­ing the econ­omy should be the top pri­or­ity for al­le­vi­at­ing poverty. “For us in China, we have em­barked on al­le­vi­at­ing poverty us­ing our own fea­tures with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics. We are ready to share our ex­pe­ri­ences on gover­nance with Africa, but we will never im­pose our ways on any­one,” he said. “We con­cen­trate 100 per­cent ef­fort on de­vel­op­ment and we have ral­lied the whole na­tion, as a re­sult we are now the sec­ond de­vel­op­ing coun­try in the world within a few decades.” Mr Wang said China was com­mit­ted to help­ing Africa erad­i­cate poverty as enun­ci­ated by Pres­i­dent Xi at the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion in South Africa in 2015. He said co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa was based on the win-win con­cept. Chair­per­son of the African Union Com­mis­sion Mr Moussa Faki Ma­hamat said an im­por­tant de­vel­op­ment les­son for Africa from China was how it man­aged to elim­i­nate poverty. “With its 2063 vi­sion, Africa has de­cided to ap­proach its fu­ture full of prom­ises,” he said. “We need tech­nol­ogy, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion and we need to look at the best tracks we can fol­low. “I have no doubt that Africa will con­tinue to in­ter­est China in terms of in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment. “China and Africa have a beau­ti­ful his­tory of com­mon strug­gle against colo­nial­ism and Africa has al­ways been draw­ing im­por­tant lessons from China.” A mem­ber of the Na­tional Com­mit­tee of Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence Mr Huang Youyi said there was need for change of men­tal­ity to­wards fight­ing poverty. “It is im­por­tant for im­pov­er­ished re­gions to rely on their ad­van­tages to elim­i­nate poverty,” he said. “Each vil­lage can fo­cus on a spe­cialised prod­uct and add value on it.” The di­rec­tor of the Zim­babwe Eco­nomic Pol­icy Anal­y­sis and Re­search Unit Dr Gib­son Chigu­mira said Africa was a para­dox, where it was ris­ing in var­i­ous ar­eas, yet poverty per­sisted. “This means we have to re­form and pro­mote pro-poor growth,” he said. “Coun­tries should look at their com­par­a­tive ad­van­tages. “There is need for hu­man cap­i­tal de­vel­op­ment, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and in­creas­ing se­cu­rity.”",津巴布韦

Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa is ex­pected to an­nounce new lock­down mea­sures to­day, while the Par­lia­men­tary Port­fo­lio Com­mit­tee on Pri­mary and Sec­ondary Ed­u­ca­tion last Thurs­day said gov­ern­ment was pon­der­ing over the safe re­open­ing of schools. By last night, Zim­babwe had recorded 36 089 cases and 1 463 deaths. The Ed­u­ca­tion Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee wants the min­istry to seek tents from the Zim­babwe Elec­toral Com­mis­sion to cre­ate tem­po­rary class­rooms to en­sure there is so­cial dis­tanc­ing at learn­ing in­sti­tu­tions when schools re­open. “Teach­ers must be pri­ori­tised for the COVID-19 vac­ci­na­tion since they are front­line work­ers in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor,” read a re­port on COVID-19 pre­pared­ness at schools by the com­mit­tee.. “The Min­istry of Pri­mary and Sec­ondary Ed­u­ca­tion must en­gage with the Zim­babwe Elec­toral Com­mis­sion (Zec) be­fore schools open for a tran­si­tional school mech­a­nism whereby tents are used to cre­ate tem­po­rary class­rooms and en­sure that learn­ers have more learn­ing time in school as com­pared to the sta­tus quo, whereby some learn­ers had been com­ing to school once a week.” The Zim­babwe Teach­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (Zimta) said schools should be opened backed by sci­en­tific data to avoid hav­ing to be closed again. “We must meet cer­tain vari­ables to en­sure that once we have opened schools, we have to sus­tain their re-open­ing. Let us do things based on sci­en­tific data. Once we open schools and the econ­omy, we must not find our­selves in a po­si­tion where we will be worse off than when we started.” Zimta sec­re­tary-gen­eral Good­will Tader­era told News­Day.

Now there is no need to con­tinue with the COVID-19 lock­down ex­ten­sion,” he said. “What we need to do is to con­tinue the fight against COVID-19 through ac­cel­er­ated na­tion­wide vac­ci­na­tion and pre­ven­ta­tive mea­sures while adopt­ing a mea­sured re­open­ing of the econ­omy as the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple are strug­gling.” MDC Al­liance sec­re­tary for health, Henry Mad­zor­era said the coun­try could not be in per­pet­ual lock­down. “We can­not be in per­pet­ual lock­down, es­pe­cially in a coun­try where there are no so­cial safety nets, but the de­ci­sion to lift the lock­down must be based on data and sci­ence, not on po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions,” he said. “Weapon­i­sa­tion of the lock­down is a tragedy, and many in Zim­babwe feel the lock­down is be­ing used as a po­lit­i­cal weapon.” Med­i­cal and Den­tal Pri­vate Prac­ti­tion­ers As­so­ci­a­tion of Zim­babwe ex­ec­u­tive pres­i­dent Jo­hannes Marisa said: “We ex­pect busi­nesses to re­sume op­er­a­tions although with some strict rec­om­men­da­tions.

Con­tin­u­ing with the lock­down is use­less as many peo­ple are ac­tu­ally de­fy­ing the lock­down mea­sures mainly be­cause they can’t sur­vive; they have been im­pov­er­ished, there are very poor peo­ple and are at a stand­still.” Com­mu­nity Work­ing Group on Health ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Itai Rusike said: “We ex­pect the gov­ern­ment to man­age the pandemic ef­fec­tively and strate­gi­cally.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200824,Stronger China-Africa ties key to post-COVID-19 eco­nomic re­cov­ery: Scholar,"NAIROBI — Stronger China-Africa ties are key to the post-COVID-19 eco­nomic re­cov­ery of the African con­ti­nent, a Kenyan scholar said yes­ter­day. Peter Kag­wanja, Africa Pol­icy In­sti­tute chief ex­ec­u­tive, a re­gional think-tank, said in a com­men­tary pub­lished in the Sun­day Na­tion that as the global COVID-19 cri­sis con­tin­ues, pro­mot­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing and tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion is emerg­ing as key to Africa’s COVID-19 re­sponse and re­cov­ery. “With the resur­gence of iso­la­tion­ism, pro­tec­tion­ism and shrink­ing re­sources for in­vest­ment from Africa’s tra­di­tional part­ners in the West, co-op­er­a­tion with China of­fers a com­mon re­sponse and re­cov­ery strat­egy for African coun­tries to com­bat COVID-19 while pro­mot­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing to roll back poverty, pro­vide jobs and liveli­hoods,” Kag­wanja wrote. He noted that ris­ing eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism, iso­la­tion­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism in the West has made Africa’s co-op­er­a­tion with China even more ur­gent and piv­otal. “But with the resur­gence of the cold war-era geopol­i­tics, sig­ni­fied by trade and tech­nol­ogy wars be­tween Amer­ica and China, Africa has to make bold and en­light­ened choices in favour of its postCOVID-19 re­cov­ery and greater de­vel­op­ment,” he ob­served. Kag­wanja said that since Fe­bru­ary, Bei­jing has col­lab­o­rated with the 54 African coun­tries to fight COVID-19, not­ing that since COVID-19 struck, Africa has waged two wars. “The first is the war to con­tain the spread of the virus, which af­fected more than one mil­lion peo­ple. The other is the war against poverty that would come from suc­cumb­ing to the dis­ease ei­ther as a health threat or as an eco­nomic threat,” he added. The scholar ob­served that the full im­pact of the COVID-19 pan­demic on African economies is yet to be as­sessed but what is cer­tain is that it has ex­acted a heavy toll on jobs and em­ploy­ment, dis­rupted man­u­fac­tur­ing sup­ply chains, lead­ing to a short­age of raw ma­te­ri­als, re­duced or­ders and led to the clo­sure of man­u­fac­tur­ing plants around the world.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210115,In­sights into ef­fects of China’s trade on Africa,"In­creased re­liance on cheap chi­nese goods has, how­ever, had detri­men­tal ef­fect on africa. It is vivid that in the case of light con­sumer goods, there are im­por­tant but has ad­verse long-term im­pli­ca­tions for africa in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. Lo­cal in­dus­tries in africa are dy­ing a silent death while chi­nese in­dus­tries con­tinue to de­velop rapidly. a num­ber of at­tempts have been made to as­sess the im­pact of in­di­rect trade links. They have fo­cused their ef­fects on prod­uct prices, the sim­i­lar­ity (or lack of it) be­tween africa’s and china’s ex­ports, and the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of win­ners and losers from trade with china. These stud­ies have pro­vided use­ful in­sights into the in­di­rect ef­fects of china’s trade on africa, the im­pact of com­pe­ti­tion from china in third world coun­trys’ mar­kets; poverty and liveli­hoods is very sub­stan­tial. some of this is pos­i­tive, in­so­far as re­duced prices of cloth­ing, im­ports en­hances the util­i­sa­tion of power of con­sumers. But the neg­a­tive im­pacts are very large, and fo­cused, and hence de­mand at­ten­tion. since there are so few back­ward con­nec­tion into tex­tiles, the ma­jor con­duit for in­come-dis­per­sal in the cloth­ing in­dus­try has been through di­rect em­ploy­ment. Job loss in south africa has been much greater since 2001, re­flect­ing the in­abil­ity of its cloth­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers to source fab­rics from asia and grow­ing im­port pen­e­tra­tion in both tex­tiles and cloth­ing, much of it sourced from china. It is not just the de­gree of job loss (par­tic­u­larly in Le­sotho and swazi­land) which is of con­cern, but the na­ture of the jobs which have gone. Most work­ers are women, and the im­pact on their fam­i­lies is se­vere. For coun­tries with­out al­ter­na­tive sources of em­ploy­ment, this em­ploy­ment de­cline has ma­jor poverty im­pli­ca­tions. We also know from global ex­pe­ri­ence that rapid eco­nomic growth can be a sig­nif­i­cant fac­tor in re­duc­ing poverty lev­els, and the loss to both GdP and ex­ports aris­ing from a sharp con­trac­tion of the cloth­ing sec­tor will have a fur­ther neg­a­tive im­pact on poverty lev­els. Of­ten un­re­strained deep­en­ing of sci­en­tific, tech­ni­cal, trade, in­vest­ment, and cul­tural co-op­er­a­tion causes crit­i­cism from the por­tion of the african elec­torate (in­clud­ing some elites), fo­cused to­wards build­ing con­struc­tive re­la­tions with the rest of the World. Pro-Western sup­port­ers in africa usu­ally raise the ques­tion of who is the real ben­e­fi­ciary of friendly re­la­tions with Beijing, they be­lieve that their lead­ers ful­fil the will of chi­nese in­vestors, who re­port­edly con­trol some of africa’s key en­ter­prises. On a gen­eral over­view, the dis­con­tent of a part of africa’s pop­u­la­tion, pri­mar­ily con­cen­trated in large cities, in the con­text of afro-sino re­la­tions is linked with so­cial and eco­nomic is­sues. For il­lus­tra­tion, some pro-Western Zim­bab­weans, com­plain that na­tional pro­duc­ers can­not com­pete with the chi­nese, since their goods are traded at a low price. In ad­di­tion, some Zim­bab­weans are not sat­is­fied with the san­i­tary and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal norms adopted at chi­nese en­ter­prises and are re­port­edly run counter to lo­cal leg­is­la­tion. Other is­sues of con­cern for some Zim­bab­weans work­ing in chi­nese com­pa­nies are “low wages and non-com­pli­ance” with Zim­babwe’s labour laws. Of­ten, the chi­nese behave, in the opin­ion of some Zim­bab­weans mostly pro-Western, as “new colonists” who al­legedly en­slave the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion. The no­tion that china con­trols most en­ter­prises in africa seem to be an over­state­ment and lacks ground­ing, in Zim­babwe for in­stance, the Zim­bab­wean In­di­geni­sa­tion and eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment act, adopted in 2007 and dele­galised in 2016, did not al­low for­eign com­pa­nies to own more than 49% of the shares of an en­ter­prise as such it was highly un­likely that be­fore its de-en­act­ment. In gen­eral, china’s neg­a­tive im­age in Zim­babwe is formed by lowqual­ity chi­nese prod­ucts (as 48% of the Zim­bab­wean pop­u­la­tion be­lieve), us­ing the coun­try as a raw ma­te­rial ap­pendage (18%), an ex­ces­sive num­ber of chi­nese spe­cial­ists de­priv­ing Zim­babwe’s jobs (9%). It seems, that a greater prob­lem is strong ties with Beijing, which are ex­tremely ben­e­fi­cial to the elites in africa. These elites ar­guably of­ten dis­re­gard the opin­ion of their pop­u­la­tion, giv­ing pref­er­ence to their own po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­flu­ence and, what is maybe more crit­i­cal, their own en­rich­ment. Im­pact of Chi­nese for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) and pro­duc­tion in Africa There was petite chi­nese FdI in africa un­til around 1990. Then from Us$20 mil­lion per year in the early 1990s, chi­nese FdI in africa shot to close to Us$100 mil­lion in 2000 and reached more than Us$1 bil­lion in 2006. This rep­re­sents a growth rate higher than chi­nese FdI to any other part of the world. ac­cord­ing to Unc­tad (2007), china’s FdI stock in africa had reached Us$1,6 bil­lion in 2005. If this fig­ure is cor­rect, then 2006 alone wit­nessed an in­crease in chi­nese in­vest­ment in africa of 62,5%. chi­nese FdI is qual­i­ta­tively dif­fer­ent in kind from euro­pean and north amer­i­can sourced FdI. His­tor­i­cally, Western and Ja­panese FdI in africa came from pri­vately-owned cor­po­ra­tions fo­cused on profit max­imi­sa­tion, gen­er­ally with rel­a­tively short time-hori­zons. By con­trast, much of chi­nese FdI in africa comes from firms which are ei­ther wholly or par­tially state-owned. They have ac­cess to very low­cost cap­i­tal, and hence can op­er­ate with much longer time-hori­zons. More­over, many of these in­vest­ments are ei­ther ex­plic­itly or im­plic­itly linked to achiev­ing strate­gic ob­jec­tives, of­ten those which are fo­cused on long-term ac­cess to raw ma­te­ri­als, and are closely bun­dled with chi­nese aid. Fur­ther­more, chi­nese FdI is at least partly driven by an ac­tive gov­ern­ment pol­icy. In the late 1990s, the chi­nese gov­ern­ment be­gan en­cour­ag­ing out­ward FdI and an­nounced its “go­ing global strat­egy.” The pol­icy has been de­vel­oped and strength­ened over the years, un­til at present chi­nese com­pa­nies en­joy four types of in­cen­tives: spe­cial and gen­eral tax in­cen­tives, credit and loans, for­eign ex­change al­lowances, and a favourable im­port and ex­port regime. china’s FdI to africa has been fur­ther sup­ported by com­mon ef­forts by the chi­nese and african gov­ern­ments. The sum­mit of the china-africa co-op­er­a­tion in novem­ber 2006 in­creased com­mit­ment for sino-africa co-op­er­a­tion. chi­nese FdI mainly takes the form of eq­uity joint ven­tures with lo­cal en­trepreneurs and/or na­tional paras­tatals. In some cases these are mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar joint ven­tures with lo­cal coun­ter­parts. The most ob­vi­ous ex­am­ples are in the en­ergy and re­source sec­tors, in which china has in­vested heav­ily in su­dan, nige­ria, Gabon, an­gola, Mali, and Zam­bia. china also has few large joint ven­tures in man­u­fac­tur­ing, in­clud­ing tex­tile fac­to­ries in Tan­za­nia and nige­ria, and soya and prawn pro­cess­ing in Mozam­bique. By 2005, the chi­nese had in­vested in 48 african coun­tries. Ven­tures in in­fra­struc­ture and con­struc­tion projects ranges from sta­di­ums in West africa, to Pres­i­den­tial Palaces (in Kin­shasa), dams (a Us$650m ten­der for nile river Merowe dam project), pipe­lines (su­dan), roads, rail­ways and gov­ern­ment build­ings. • Read full ar­ti­cle on www.newsday.co.zw • Liv­ing­stone Kaz­izi is a Master of Sci­ence in In­ter­na­tional Trade and Diplo­macy stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Zim­babwe.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201116,Chi­nese farmer gets new lease on life through e-com­merce,"LANZHOU - Yu Jun­qiang, a farmer in north­west China’s Gansu Prov­ince, had more than 10 000 or­ders of medic­i­nal prod­ucts worth 400 000 yuan ( about US$60 400) dur­ing the an­nual Sin­gles’ Day on­line shop­ping spree this year. Over a decade ago, Yu could not even recog­nise the power but­ton on a com­puter. Now he has be­come a suc­cess­ful e-com­merce busi­ness­man and also the owner of a lo­cal com­pany. Check­ing his clothes and hair, the 41-year-old man turned on his phone cam­era, clicked on the screen, and started his livestream­ing show, in­tro­duc­ing his prod­ucts to peo­ple across the na­tion. Be­hind him, his em­ploy­ees were busy pack­ing parcels. “The Sin­gles’ Day is one of the busiest days for us. We worked over­time for days to pre­pare for the surg­ing on­line sales,” said Yu, whose eyes were black-ringed. Yu lives in Zhong­bao vil­lage in Minx­ian County. It is one of the 52 Chi­nese coun­ties yet to be delisted as a “poverty-stricken” county. It is also one of the big­gest pro­duc­ers of An­gel­ica Sinen­sis, as­tra­galus root, and Codonop­sis pi­lo­sula in China. The herb in­dus­try gen­er­ates over 60 per­cent of its lo­cal in­come on­line. Yu’s fam­ily has been farm­ing for gen­er­a­tions. They grew wheat and An­gel­ica Sinen­sis. When he was young, Yu went out to work to ease the bur­den of the fam­ily. He would carry a bag of An­gel­ica Sinen­sis and sell it on the road­side. His goods did not sell well. Al­though peo­ple in the ur­ban area showed cu­rios­ity about the nat­u­ral medic­i­nal ma­te­ri­als, few of them would make a pur­chase. A man who set up a stall next to Yu once sug­gested that he should sell his prod­ucts on­line. Back then, Yu knew lit­tle about the in­ter­net. Fol­low­ing the man’s ad­vice, he went to an In­ter­net cafe to try this new thing. “The first time I went to the in­ter­net cafe, I didn’t know how to turn on the com­puter,” said Yu. Since then, Yu went to the in­ter­net lo­ca­tion ev­ery day af­ter work and learned how to type and sell things on­line. Through the in­ter­net, he found a dif­fer­ent world. In 2009, act­ing on a call from the lo­cal gov­ern­ment to pro­mote e-com­merce as a way to al­le­vi­ate poverty in ru­ral ar­eas, Yu re­turned to his home­town and pre­pared to start his own busi­ness. He set up an on­line shop on Taobao, a plat­form un­der China’s e- com­merce pow­er­house Alibaba, and sold Chi­nese medic­i­nal prod­ucts on­line. How­ever, his on­line shop did not re­ceive any or­ders for three months. “It was a hard time, but I felt I was try­ing and mov­ing for­ward,” he said. Dur­ing the day­time, he read books re­lated to web de­sign and mar­ket­ing strate­gies, and in the evening, he stayed at the shop overnight to prac­tice what he learned from the books. Grad­u­ally, his on­line shop picked up. “Peo­ple are pay­ing more at­ten­tion to their health. Es­pe­cially in south China, many fam­i­lies have the habit now of drink­ing herbal tea,” Yu said. As his busi­ness grew, Yu es­tab­lished an e- com­merce com­pany in 2017 and hired skilled work­ers to run his on­line busi­ness. To help more vil­lagers rid them­selves of poverty, he set up a co­op­er­a­tive and pur­chased medic­i­nal ma­te­ri­als from im­pov­er­ished fam­i­lies at a price higher than the mar­ket price. Now, his co­op­er­a­tive at­tracts more than 170 im­pov­er­ished house­holds. “E-com­merce has brought me a new lease on life. “I’m still a farmer, but I’m a new farmer in the in­ter­net era,” said Yu. - Xin­hua",津巴布韦

Re­mark­ably, some­where within the 70-year ta­pes­try of his­tory, China did a unique thing for Zim­babwe. The year was 2008. Zim­babwe was un­der at­tack from Bri­tain, the United States of Amer­ica and other Western coun­tries at the United Na­tions Security Coun­cil as the for­mer sought the per­mis­sion of the world body to im­pose sanc­tions on the coun­try. China stood by Zim­babwe. And this was a high point in global geopol­i­tics. On July 11. 2008, the UN Security Coun­cil failed to pass a res­o­lu­tion that would have im­posed sanc­tions against Zim­babwe as China and Rus­sia used their veto pow­ers to block the de­vel­op­ment, an­ger­ing Western coun­tries who had sought to use the sanc­tions — un­der the du­bi­ous Re­spon­si­bil­ity to Pro­tect (R2P) prin­ci­ple, to in­vade Zim­babwe. “. . . China ve­toed the pro­posed res­o­lu­tion to im­pose sanc­tions on Zim­babwe at the UN Security Coun­cil in 2008, which is the first and only time that China has ex­er­cised its veto at the Security Coun­cil for an African coun­try,” Am­bas­sador Guo re­lated yes­ter­day. The re­flec­tion comes at a time Zim­babwe and its al­lies are push­ing for the re­moval of sanc­tions against the coun­try. Sadc coun­tries have de­clared Oc­to­ber 25 as the day for sol­i­dar­ity against sanc­tions on Zim­babwe as they will carry out dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties in a show of diplo­matic force. Fur­ther, the coun­tries agreed to take the mes­sage to the on go­ing United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly. Zim­babwe and China have done more, be­fore and af­ter July 2008: from the for­mer sup­port­ing Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle, Zim­babwe’s sup­port for “One-China” prin­ci­ple, to strength­en­ing of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions and co­op­er­a­tion un­der Pres­i­dents Mnan­gagwa and Xi Jin­ping. Next year, the two coun­tries mark 40 years of diplo­matic re­la­tions.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160520,China vows to help 12 mil­lion peo­ple,"BEI­JING. - China has vowed to help 12 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty in the next five years through tourism devel­op­ment and strength­en­ing in­ter­na­tional tourism co­op­er­a­tion. Premier Li Ke­qiang made the re­marks at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the First World Con­fer­ence on Tourism Devel­op­ment held at the Great Hall of the Peo­ple in down­town Bei­jing yes­ter­day morn­ing. He said most of China’s im­pov­er­ished peo­ple live in poor and re­mote ar­eas, which face dif­fi­cul­ties in de­vel­op­ing agri­cul­ture and in­dus­try, but have unique ad­van­tages for de­vel­op­ing tourism. Many re­mote and poor ar­eas have al­ready re­duced poverty through tour- ism devel­op­ment. Li said tourism will help China foster a new driv­ing force for devel­op­ment, achieve en­trepreneur­ship and in­no­va­tion, re­duce poverty and en­hance friend­ship with other coun­tries. China will treat tourism as an im­por­tant area for pro­mot­ing struc­tural re­form, es­pe­cially sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form and eco­nomic devel­op­ment. China will open the tourist mar­ket to non-gov­ern­men­tal cap­i­tal, deepen co­op­er­a­tion with for­eign cap­i­tal, strengthen hard­ware con­struc­tion and mar­ket su­per­vi­sion, Li noted. Ac­cord­ing to Li, the tourism in­dus­try di­rectly con­trib­uted 4,9 per­cent of GDP in 2015 and di­rectly em­ployed nearly 28 mil­lion peo­ple. - Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201111,Africa can ben­e­fit from China’s new global sta­tus,"THE fact that China has over­taken the United States to be­come the world’s largest econ­omy might not be any­thing new to many by now, since this was con­firmed last month. The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund uses the more reli­able and now widely ac­cepted yard­stick called the pur­chas­ing power par­ity to de­ter­mine the eco­nomic out­put of a coun­try in the rank­ing. This time around, it found that China’s econ­omy is at US$24,2 tril­lion com­pared to the US at US$20,8 tril­lion. Well, to some of us who have been fol­low­ing de­vel­op­ments in China for some time, this did not come as a sur­prise. China might ac­tu­ally have over­taken the US as a lead­ing eco­nomic pow­er­house some years back, judg­ing by the progress it has made in its jour­ney to­wards eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Since 1978 when China started mak­ing a turn­around un­der its re­form and open­ing up pol­icy, the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant has reg­is­tered mas­sive growth in all sec­tors. Now that the phe­nom­e­nal growth has been con­firmed by the Asian coun­try mov­ing to the first spot in eco­nomic growth, it is im­por­tant that African coun­tries start ask­ing ques­tions on how they can reap the ben­e­fits. In my view, Africa stands to ben­e­fit ex­ceed­ingly from this de­vel­op­ment, con­sid­er­ing that re­la­tions be­tween the Asian coun­try and many coun­tries on the con­ti­nent has been cor­dial. China’s new sta­tus con­firms a coun­try drip­ping with cap­i­tal and this means the ap­petite to in­vest else­where is set to in­crease in the near fu­ture. And the first des­ti­na­tion for such in­vest­ment is go­ing to be Africa, where China has al­ready in­vested bil­lions in var­i­ous sec­tors. What will spur this new ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment in Africa is the fact that China al­ready of­fers the near­est ex­am­ple to the con­ti­nent on how a coun­try can turn its for­tunes within a short pe­riod. China was ranked one of the poor­est coun­tries on the planet nearly 40 years ago, but it has grown in leaps and bounds to claim the top spot in eco­nomic growth. What this means is that the Asian coun­try has done some­thing right to be able to move al­most all of its cit­i­zens out of poverty, with the re­main­ing 5,5 mil­lion no longer liv­ing be­low the poverty da­tum line by the end of this year. This is a mas­sive move­ment con­sid­er­ing that around 1978, China had more than 800 mil­lion peo­ple liv­ing in poverty. The magic wand which China waved in get­ting its fun­da­men­tals right is the same that African coun­tries des­per­ately need to­day to start their jour­ney to pros­per­ity. But there is no doubt that the struc­tural changes that are tak­ing place in China’s econ­omy will im­pact pos­i­tively on African coun­tries’ de­vel­op­men­tal am­bi­tions. A num­ber of African coun­tries are al­ready linked to China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, a colos­sal de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme reg­is­ter­ing mas­sive re­sults in coun­tries that are ben­e­fit­ing. BRI aims at im­prov­ing in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment along cor­ri­dors that used to host the an­cient Silk Road, cov­er­ing var­i­ous coun­tries in Asia, Europe and Africa. With China now be­ing the big­gest econ­omy, more in­vest­ment is ex­pected to be poured into this ini­tia­tive, re­sult­ing in growth in the af­fected coun­tries. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive was launched by Chi­nese President Xi Jin­ping in 2013 and im­me­di­ately opened up in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in many coun­tries. Al­ready, var­i­ous coun­tries on the African con­ti­nent have com­pleted a num­ber of in­fras­truc­tural projects un­der Belt and Road, while the un­fin­ished ones are ex­pected to get a new im­pe­tus. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s vi­sion un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive is to build rail­way net­works, en­ergy pipe­lines and high­ways that will in­crease in­ter­na­tional trade. More Chi­nese com­pa­nies are ex­pected to take ad­van­tage of the ini­tia­tive to ven­ture into Africa where the con­ti­nent pro­vides vast op­por­tu­ni­ties. By over­tak­ing the US in eco­nomic progress, China has proved its met­tle, es­pe­cially con­sid­er­ing the tight com­pe­ti­tion and un­fair prac­tice from some Western coun­tries. The con­fer­ring on China with the sta­tus of the largest econ­omy in the world comes at a time African coun­tries are lean­ing more to­wards the Asian coun­try for their de­vel­op­ment. The Fo­rum for China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) is one plat­form ex­pected to be strength­ened as China flexes its eco­nomic mus­cles. China must use the op­por­tu­nity to lead the world in pur­su­ing win-win co­op­er­a­tion, mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion and mu­tual re­spect. The main­te­nance of the up­ward trend in the Chi­nese econ­omy will be of great in­ter­est, es­pe­cially to Zim­babwe, which is im­ple­ment­ing multi-bil­lion deals signed with the global eco­nomic gi­ant. The deals are in var­i­ous sec­tors, which in­clude in­fra­struc­ture, en­ergy, power, trade and agri­cul­ture, with some Chi­nese part­ners al­ready on site for some of the projects. It should be al­ways re­mem­bered that the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the co­op­er­a­tion deals will al­ways hinge on the con­tin­ued sta­bil­ity and growth of the Chi­nese econ­omy, which is ex­pected to main­tain its new found sta­tus. With China lead­ing the world in eco­nomic progress, it is ex­pected to con­sol­i­date its rise as the ma­jor in­vest­ment part­ner for African coun­tries. The in­vest­ment is al­ready ex­ten­sive, and will help African coun­tries gain tech­nolo­gies that will en­able value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of natural re­sources to bring more fi­nan­cial ben­e­fits for the con­ti­nent. Chi­nese fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions like the Ex­port-Im­port Bank of China and the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund are ex­pected to play a ma­jor role in fi­nanc­ing the en­vis­aged in­ter­est of the Asian coun­try’s pri­vate sec­tor in Africa. The Ex­port-Im­port Bank of China stands out as one of the ma­jor driv­ers of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant and African coun­tries. The bank, also known as China Ex­im­bank, has been pro­vid­ing funds to sup­port China’s part­ner­ship with Africa, back­ing many of the big projects be­ing un­der­taken in African coun­tries. The projects are in var­i­ous sec­tors — power trans­mis­sion and trans­for­ma­tion sta­tions, rail­way and road net­works, bridges, Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones, hos­pi­tals, ports, Gov­ern­ment of­fice build­ings, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion fa­cil­i­ties and schools. China Ex­im­bank has been play­ing a ma­jor role in fund­ing, not only these projects, but many oth­ers, es­pe­cially in coun­tries along the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive in var­i­ous con­ti­nents across the world. On the other hand, the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund is an­other in­sti­tu­tion which China, as the lead­ing eco­nomic pow­er­house in the world, can ex­ploit to en­sure that Africa ben­e­fits. The eq­uity fund has al­ready been in­stru­men­tal in sup­port­ing the trade and co­op­er­a­tion that has brought a clear de­vel­op­men­tal path for many African coun­tries. Es­tab­lished by the China De­vel­op­ment Bank, the fund is ca­pac­i­tated to the tune of US$5 bil­lion, but at the Focac sum­mit in South Africa in 2015, President Xi Jin­ping pro­posed an ad­di­tional US$5 bil­lion. What is now needed is for African coun­tries to up their game, es­pe­cially com­ing up with clear rules and reg­u­la­tions that gov­ern in­vest­ments. There will be need for coun­tries on the con­ti­nent to adopt a pro-growth ini­tia­tive that en­sures re­forms in var­i­ous sec­tor so that they are able to at­tract more cap­i­tal. With the his­tor­i­cal links African coun­tries have with China, it is pos­si­ble that they can turn the cor­dial po­lit­i­cal re­la­tions into eco­nomic ben­e­fits. Time to lay the foun­da­tion for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion is now, and China as the lead­ing eco­nomic pow­er­house in the world has al­ready shown will­ing­ness to par­tic­i­pate in this en­deav­our. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210322,How lead­ers use power as de­fined by their pri­or­i­ties,"ONE of my for­mer lec­tur­ers in devel­op­ment stud­ies used to say to de­velop a so­ci­ety is one of the eas­ier goals to achieve but the chal­lenge lies in nav­i­gat­ing the im­ped­i­ments in im­ple­ment­ing devel­op­ment projects. He ar­gued that if a so­ci­ety and its lead­er­ship de­cide to pro­ceed on a na­tional pro­ject, they must en­sure that all the nec­es­sary re­quire­ments are avail­able in­clud­ing com­mit­ting them­selves and their time to the achieve­ment of the projects. He fur­ther ar­gued that in so­ci­eties that op­er­ate on demo­cratic prin­ci­ples, the first line of im­ped­i­ments tend to be in se­cur­ing con­sen­sus on projects, re­source al­lo­ca­tion and who to im­ple­ment them. At each stage of th­ese dis­cus­sions, ar­gu­ments and nar­ra­tives are gen­er­ated, some of which end­ing up mak­ing what looks like an easy pro­ject im­pos­si­ble to im­ple­ment. What dis­tin­guishes so­ci­eties’ abil­ity to de­velop is partly how their lead­ers utilise power, re­sources and di­rect peo­ple to­wards achieve­ment of devel­op­ment projects. Within that frame­work, po­lit­i­cal power be­comes the ca­pac­ity of an in­di­vid­ual or a group of them to in­flu­ence the ac­tions, be­liefs, or be­hav­iour of others. De­pend­ing on con­text, power can be seen as evil or un­just; and it can be seen as good and as some­thing in­her­ited or given for ex­er­cis­ing hu­man­is­tic ob­jec­tives that will help, move, and em­power others as well. Let us look at a coun­try such as Zim­babwe at the stage of coloni­sa­tion. The colo­nial­ists came and in­vaded the land that be­longed to a so­ci­ety but was largely un­de­vel­oped. They took power from the oc­cu­pants of the land, pushed some of them out of their an­ces­tral land and started putting in place struc­tures that be­came towns and cities to­day in Zim­babwe. Part of this process in­cluded draw­ing up plans and im­ple­ment­ing them through ac­quir­ing free or cheap labour and ma­te­rial re­sources from lo­cal peo­ple, most of the time, against their will and through use of co­er­cive power. Through th­ese un­just and co­er­cive pro­cesses, most of the build­ings, roads, util­i­ties and other in­fra­struc­ture that de­fine our state of devel­op­ment to­day were es­tab­lished. In the last four decades, the world watched and con­demned how cheap labour partly steered China’s eco­nomic growth which to­day has be­come the ba­sis for re­duced poverty. The dif­fer­ence lies in that Chi­nese lead­er­ship “abused” its peo­ple to es­tab­lish an eco­nomic foun­da­tion. On av­er­age, labour com­prises about half or roughly 40–60% of the to­tal con­struc­tion cost of most projects. This means that, in the con­text of pre-in­de­pen­dent Zim­babwe, more build­ings and in­fra­struc­ture were built faster at half the price dur­ing that dark pe­riod of our his­tory. Po­lit­i­cal power was “abused“for con­struc­tive and devel­op­ment pur­poses which would ben­e­fit fu­ture gen­er­a­tions for cen­turies to come. It is in the same pro­cesses that we find nar­ra­tives such as racism, op­pres­sion, coloni­sa­tion, un­just and other ills. But the out­come of the same evil pro­cesses is our pride to­day. Our in­fra­struc­ture, largely de­vel­oped dur­ing colo­nial­ism, is an out­come of that un­just sea­son. We have since in­de­pen­dence la­belled th­ese the fruits of our an­ces­tors’ labour with­out ac­knowl­edg­ing that the same fruits were from a colo­nial or­chard — colo­nial mas­ter­plan. Come 1980, po­lit­i­cal power shifted af­ter many years of fight­ing to dis­place colo­nial power. The rea­sons for the fight were that it was colo­nial, op­pres­sive, racist and, there­fore, not pro­gres­sive. In other words, we had is­sues in the pro­cesses and not in the out­comes. By 1980, the out­come of the colo­nial pe­riod would show that Zim­babwe’s econ­omy was the sec­ond big­gest in Africa whose cur­rency was stronger than that of the United States of Amer­ica and again that was our pride then. We in­her­ited among the most ad­vanced in­fra­struc­ture in the re­gion at in­de­pen­dence which lead­ers of other African coun­tries de­scribed as the jewel of Africa. With power hav­ing shifted to black lead­er­ship, it was then as­sumed that the coun­try was no longer un­der the hands of op­pres­sive set­tlers and, there­fore, the prob­lems that be­dev­iled the eco­nomic pro­duc­tion pro­cesses were elim­i­nated. The out­come of the fight by black peo­ple to re­gain con­trol of their re­sources was then de­scribed as free­dom — a premise seen as nec­es­sary to steer the coun­try for­ward in terms of devel­op­ment. How­ever, the past four decades have shown that power is both in­sipid and liq­uid and can be used to ad­vance the pri­or­i­ties of those who hold it. In Zim­babwe, it was never used as the peo­ple in­tended. The colo­nial lead­er­ship used po­lit­i­cal power to op­press while im­ple­ment­ing eco­nomic devel­op­ment plans whose out­come is seen in the size of the econ­omy and the large num­ber of peo­ple who ben­e­fited from the same econ­omy. On the other hand, the black lead­er­ship adopted the same op­pres­sive and co­er­cive at­ti­tude but this time not to de­velop the coun­try but to pro­tect their power and loot na­tional re­sources. This seemed to be their pri­or­ity or rather the ob­jec­tive of dis­plac­ing the colo­nial sys­tem. The cur­rent lev­els of poverty and re­gres­sion in devel­op­ment is sim­ply be­cause th­ese are not the pri­or­i­ties of the cur­rent lead­er­ship. If peo­ple can vol­un­teer to die for the rul­ing party for free, they can surely do so to build bridges, schools, hos­pi­tals, and other devel­op­ment projects.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210226,Jin­babùwéi is the 23rd prov­ince of the China,"OF­TEN it has been said Zim­babwe is South Africa’s 10th prov­ince.  is er­ro­neous per­cep­tion is based on the re­liance of Zim­babwe on South Africa in terms of trade and the free-flow of Zim­bab­weans across its bor­ders. Also, Zim­bab­wean su­per­mar­kets are awash with South African goods, a con­fir­ma­tion of Zim­babwe as an ap­pendage of its south­ern neigh­bour. But it may turn out Zim­babwe is, in fact, the 23rd prov­ince of China; they don’t call it Jin­babùwéi for noth­ing. Look at how the South­east Asian coun­try is es­tab­lish­ing its foot­print in Zim­babwe.  e US$300 mil­lion par­lia­ment build­ing near­ing com­ple­tion in Mount Ham­p­den will surely be its flag­ship de­vel­op­ment in Zim­babwe, but strate­gi­cally it will pale in sig­nif­i­cance com­pared to the Na­tional Data Cen­tre (NDC)com­mis­sioned by Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa this week. What is the NDC and why should Zim­bab­weans be wor­ried? Ac­cord­ing to Mnan­gagwa the NDC “will an­chor all e-gov­ern­ment pro­grammes and will al­low co­or­di­nated plan­ning and mon­i­tor­ing of re­sults” of all gov­ern­ment pro­grammes thereby “al­low­ing the gov­ern­ment to con­tinue up­scal­ing im­ple­men­ta­tion of in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion to ac­cel­er­ate the mod­erni­sa­tion, in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and growth of the econ­omy.” is means go­ing for­ward the NDC has be­come the heart­beat of the Zim­bab­wean gov­ern­ment.  at is pre­cisely why ev­ery Zim­bab­wean ought to be wor­ried. In the past few years the Chi­nese have been ac­cused of hack­ing into build­ings they have built in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, Chi­nese com­pa­nies have built at least 186 gov­ern­ment build­ings and 14 “sen­si­tive in­tra-gov­ern­men­tal telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works in Africa from which China may be spy­ing on African gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials”. A red flag was raised a few years ago on the Chi­nese-built African Union head­quar­ters in Ad­dis Ababa. When it be­came op­er­a­tional, a Ja­panese com­pany no­ticed un­usual data traf­fic be­tween Ad­dis Ababa and Shang­hai. China was ac­cused of in­stalling lis­ten­ing de­vices in the AU HQ and servers in the head­quar­ters were al­legedly se­cretly send­ing data to a com­puter sys­tem in Shang­hai each night be­tween midnight and 2am. Zim­bab­weans’ fear should be that the par­lia­ment build­ing and now the NDC may be the Tro­jan horses through which the Chi­nese may con­trol the gov­ern­ment. Ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the Her­itage Foun­da­tion, a United States-based con­ser­va­tive think tank: “ e Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has a long his­tory of all types of sur­veil­lance and es­pi­onage glob­ally. So we know this is the sort of thing they want to do, the sort of thing they have the ca­pac­ity to do. And also, Africa is im­por­tant enough to them to do it.” Vac­cine war ANY doubts that Zim­babwe is the 23rd prov­ince of China may have been dis­pelled when it do­nated a fur­ther 200 000 doses of its Sinopharm vac­cine dou­bling the num­ber of jabs they have given the coun­try, gratis. China has 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple who need to be vac­ci­nated, but it would rather vac­ci­nate Zim­bab­weans ahead of its own peo­ple.  e rea­son for this is not far to find: it is a phi­los­o­phy called “ef­fec­tive oc­cu­pa­tion”. It may be in­ter­est­ing to note that the ter­ri­tory called Zim­babwe was at the cen­tre of what was called the Scram­ble for Africa in the 19th Century.  e fight was get­ting dirty around the 1880s with Ce­cil John Rhodes try­ing to ful­fill his Cape-to-Cairo dream in which he wished to lay a rail­way line that would link the two ex­treme tips of Africa. Be­cause the said line would give him con­trol of cen­tral Africa the other colonis­ing pow­ers were wor­ried. e Por­tuguese wished to link their colonies — An­gola and Mozam­bique; Ger­many wanted to link Namibia with Tan­za­nia. As can be seen, to achieve this each one of them had to ac­quire Zim­babwe; so the scram­ble for Africa, in fact, be­came the scram­ble for Zim­babwe.  is was not go­ing to end well, so they con­vened a con­fer­ence at Ber­lin, Ger­many in 1884 where they pro­nounced the pol­icy of “ef­fec­tive oc­cu­pa­tion”, which com­pelled any as­pir­ing coloniser to ef­fec­tively oc­cupy the ter­ri­tory it wished to take.  at was why the Pioneer col­umn in­vaded Zim­babwe six years later. Now Zim­babwe is in the midst of a lat­ter-day scram­ble for its ter­ri­tory and the Covid-19 pan­demic has be­come its ra­tio­nale. e United King­dom was the first to of­fer Zim­babwe a hand in sourc­ing vac­cines. It of­fered to vac­ci­nate 20% (about three mil­lion) of Zim­babwe’s pop­u­la­tion against the pan­demic when the Covax vac­cine fa­cil­ity be­came ready.  is was be­fore the UK it­self — which was hit worse by the pan­demic — had sat­is­fied its own de­mands.  e Zim­bab­wean gov­ern­ment turned the of­fer away be­cause the UK wanted the ex­clu­sive right to oc­cupy Zim­babwe like they did in 1890. To see just how fierce the scram­ble is, con­sider that Rus­sia is on the side­lines ready to fly the Sput­nik V weapon and In­dia, of the As­traZeneca-SA de­ba­cle, also has Zim­babwe in its crosshairs. But in the mean­time, China has seem­ingly won the bat­tle but the war is far from over as there is loads of re­sis­tance to its vac­cine from Zim­bab­weans who in­clude med­i­cal per­son­nel.  e fierce pro­pa­ganda war may still sway Zim­bab­weans one way or the other. But what Zim­bab­weans should know is that the new scram­ble is not about them — less than 40 000 Zim­bab­weans have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus and less than 1 400 have died.  at’s not a train crash! So this is all about the coun­try’s re­sources; the gold, the plat­inum, the lithium, the di­a­monds and most im­por­tantly the fer­tile land. In­fi­delity NOT a week passes with­out a video of men fight­ing over women go­ing vi­ral on so­cial me­dia.  is week the video was of a man seated in his SUV with a woman. It turned out the woman was some­one else’s wife.  e adul­ter­ous man and the woman were given a thor­ough beat­ing and were dragged in a pool of dirty wa­ter on the road.  e judg­men­tal men in the crowd helped the cuck­old mete out in­stant jus­tice on the pair. But why does it seem there is a rise in the num­ber of adul­ter­ous re­la­tion­ships?  e an­swer is surely to do with the rav­ages of the Covid-19 pan­demic on poor fam­i­lies and how the gov­ern­ment has ne­glected this stra­tum of so­ci­ety. To put it more emo­tively, it’s about the chil­dren! Any tour of the low­in­come sub­urbs will re­veal the sorry state of the chil­dren; mal­nu­tri­tion is ram­pant and their dirty tat­tered clothes will bring tears to the eyes of the faint-hearted. e pan­demic hit the ur­ban pop­u­la­tion, which mostly sur­vived in the in­for­mal sec­tor.  e women who used to run stalls all over the place can no longer do it due to the gov­ern­ment’s lock­down mea­sures. In­for­mal traders live from hand to mouth so with­out their daily pick­ings hunger hits them hard. e women, es­pe­cially, are hit hard­est.  ey take care of the dayto-day run­ning of the house­hold; they are sup­posed to en­sure the chil­dren get some­thing to eat and some­thing to wear.  ese can no longer be guar­an­teed be­cause the stall from which they used to sell toma­toes and sec­ond­hand cloth­ing have been closed. e gov­ern­ment which promised some form of re­lief for the hard­est hit fam­i­lies has not been forth­com­ing. When it has, the pay­outs have been so pal­try as to be use­less.  e men have been hit too.  ey are no longer earn­ing their weekly wages be­cause the fac­to­ries have been closed. With­out an in­come their tem­pers flare up eas­ily. But un­like the men, the women can­not watch while their chil­dren starve, so for sur­vival they in­volve them­selves in il­licit love af­fairs. One just has to drive along the streets around dusk to see how de­cent-look­ing women line up the streets so­lic­it­ing for sex. Some­times their hus­bands catch them at it. But the men’s anger is of­ten mis­di­rected.  ey beat up the men who have had trans­ac­tional sex with their wives; and they also beat up their wives who have given their chil­dren, and the men, some­thing to eat from the money they earned. eir anger should be di­rected at the gov­ern­ment which has re­neged on its prom­ise to help poor fam­i­lies dur­ing th­ese try­ing times.  ey should also di­rect their anger at their law­mak­ers who do not ques­tion poli­cies such as the clam­p­down on in­for­mal traders and lock­downs which have been im­posed on the peo­ple in a one-size-fits-all fash­ion.  ere just should be an­other way th­ese lock­downs can be im­ple­mented with­out driv­ing young men into grind­ing poverty and help­less­ness which drive gen­der-based vi­o­lence. “China has 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple who need to be vac­ci­nated, but it would rather vac­ci­nate Zim­bab­weans ahead of its own peo­ple.  e rea­son for this is not far to find: it is a phi­los­o­phy called ‘ef­fec­tive oc­cu­pa­tion’.”",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210224,NASA ro­botic ve­hi­cle land­ing: An in­spi­ra­tion for African Unity,"The US NASA Per­se­ver­ance Rover safely landed on Mars on Fe­bru­ary 18 2021 af­ter a 470, 7mil­lion-kilo­me­tre-jour­ney from earth, which it be­gan on July 30 2020. The ro­botic ve­hi­cle landed it­self flaw­lessly in Mars’ Jezero Crater. The sci­en­tific ob­jec­tives 1) Search for, and iden­tify, a past ca­pa­ble of mi­cro­bial life, i.e, in­ves­ti­gate the hab­it­abil­ity of Mars. 2) Look for signs of cur­rent mi­cro­bial life (biosig­na­tures) in the places where the his­tory of life is de­tected. 3) Note the dis­tinc­tion be­tween mi­cro­bial life and in­tel­li­gent life (hu­man-like life). The ex­pec­ta­tion (or as­sump­tion) is that there is no in­tel­li­gent life else­where in the uni­verse ex­cept on earth. Of course, this is our shared hu­man ar­ro­gance as a species. 4) Col­lect rock and soil sam­ples, an­a­lyse them on site and bring some to earth for fur­ther stud­ies about Mars’s min­er­al­i­sa­tion, ge­og­ra­phy, hab­it­abil­ity etc. No sur­prises on who will own the min­er­als if they are dis­cov­ered! 5) Pre­pare Mars for the land­ing and then habi­ta­tion by hu­mans. For ex­am­ple, on the Rover, there is equip­ment to pro­duce oxy­gen from Mars’ at­mos­phere, which con­sists mainly of car­bon diox­ide. No sur­prises on who will colonise the planet if it is made hab­it­able! The tech­nol­ogy in­volved The Per­se­ver­ance Mars Rover is a six-wheeled mo­bile ro­bot with the fol­low­ing tech­nolo­gies: 1) Mul­ti­ple sen­sors such as su­per-cam­eras, im­agers and radar. 2) In­tel­li­gent sen­sor fu­sion and con­trol — to in­ter­pret the var­i­ous sen­sor in­for­ma­tion and use the out­come to di­rect the Rover’s move­ment. 3) Six wheel mo­bile ro­botic tech­nol­ogy for nav­i­gat­ing the rough, rugged and un­pre­dictable Mar­tian ter­rain. 3) Ro­botic arm for col­lect­ing sam­ples and ma­nip­u­lat­ing ob­jects on the sur­face of Mars. 4) An ul­tra­vi­o­let spec­trom­e­ter and an X-ray spec­trom­e­ter for on-site anal­y­sis of col­lected soil and rock sam­ples. 5) MEDA — A mounted weather sta­tion on the Rover. 6) MOXIE — Tech­nol­ogy to pro­duce oxy­gen from car­bon diox­ide, which is the dominant gas in the Mar­tian at­mos­phere. 7) Mini-he­li­copter drone — A so­lar-pow­ered ex­per­i­men­tal air­craft to test flight sta­bil­ity and scout driv­ing routes for Rover. Why space ex­plo­ration? Are we not wast­ing re­sources by pur­su­ing such grand sci­en­tific projects? Well, hu­man cu­rios­ity will con­tinue to ex­ist in the midst of poverty, dis­ease, in­equal­ity or war. Those with the cash will use their re­sources to ad­dress to ex­plore, ex­per­i­ment and ven­ture into the un­known. What will be pru­dent is to pur­sue a mul­ti­pur­pose agenda where sci­ence is used to ad­dress cu­rios­ity but also to solve ex­ist­ing prob­lems. More im­por­tantly, the sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy de­vel­oped from the pur­suit of cu­rios­ity (such as space ex­plo­ration) can be ap­plied to solve ur­gent and press­ing hu­man prob­lems. It is a dy­namic process Given the neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ences (to Africans and oth­ers) of past voy­ages and dis­cov­er­ies, this plunge into space ex­plo­ration should be co­op­er­a­tive. how­ever, no one will in­volve the African if we do not pull our re­sources to­gether and as­sert agency as a united and in­te­grated con­ti­nent. Short of that, we will re­main noisy by­standers and ob­servers, if not vic­tims. China and In­dia are out there play­ing the space game. here are their strengths China: 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple and GDP US$14,3 tril­lion; In­dia: 1,37 bil­lion peo­ple and a GDP of US$2,9 tril­lion. If Africans work as one mar­ket (or coun­try), our strength is: 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple and col­lec­tive GDP of US$2,5 tril­lion. This is what we should lever­age as one en­tity and not frag­mented and non-vi­able states. Only as such a vast in­te­grated econ­omy can a united Africa par­tic­i­pate in th­ese co­op­er­a­tive sci­en­tific ad­ven­tures and dis­cov­er­ies, not as small and in­con­se­quen­tial states such as Zim­babwe, South Africa, Botswana or Nige­ria. We must unite in pur­suit of high tech­nol­ogy and ad­vanced sci­ence. Con­clu­sion The land­ing of the Per­se­ver­ance Mars Rover is both an in­struc­tive in­spi­ra­tion and a pro­found de­mon­stra­tion of the un­bounded na­ture of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy ap­pli­ca­tions. As Africans, we must be in­spired, em­brace sci­ence and de­ploy tech­nol­ogy to solve our many de­vel­op­men­tal prob­lems. This am­bi­tion can be best ac­com­plished as one coun­try, the United States of Africa (USA). Af­ter­thought Well, is the USA a re­al­is­tic propo­si­tion? In­deed, it is a daunt­ing but ex­is­ten­tial propo­si­tion. There were mas­sive dif­fi­cul­ties that the US, China, In­dia and USSR (later Rus­sia) went through to es­tab­lish their pow­er­ful and com­pet­i­tive na­tions. The cre­ation of those su­per­states was rooted in, and an­chored by, im­mense sac­ri­fice and strug­gle. No pain, no gain. Noth­ing ever comes from soft ground. With­out sac­ri­fice and strug­gle, there will be no progress. We have to give up on nar­row na­tional sovereignty, limited na­tional agen­das and mean­ing­less na­tional pres­i­den­cies (55 of them!) to em­brace the United States of Africa. Most of th­ese African lead­ers — our Pres­i­dents and Prime-Min­is­ters — and their peo­ple are not pre­pared to ab­sorb th­ese short-term sac­ri­fices and em­brace the long-term col­lec­tive great­ness. In fact, the African lead­ers pay lip ser­vice to re­gional (Sadc, EAC, ECOWAS, etc) and con­ti­nen­tal (AU, AFCFTA, NEPAD, etc) de­ci­sions. They meet, make im­por­tant re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal de­ci­sions, take a group pic­ture and re­vert to na­tional plans and vi­sions when they are back in their coun­tries. The grand re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal projects are not im­ple­mented. They are not even re­ferred to in na­tional dis­courses or re­flected in na­tional bud­gets. Tragic. Clearly, there is need to demon­strate that the USA’s ben­e­fits and ef­fi­cacy out­weigh the na­tional sac­ri­fices. More im­por­tantly, it is es­sen­tial to ex­plain that the USA’s cre­ation is a mat­ter of African sur­vival and not choice. Un­der glob­al­i­sa­tion and the 4IR, we will only flour­ish and pros­per as a po­lit­i­cally united and eco­nom­i­cally in­te­grated con­ti­nent. Need­less to say, unit­ing Africans and in­te­grat­ing the con­ti­nent will re­quire prin­ci­pled, ded­i­cated and vi­sion­ary Pan-African lead­ers who are sadly in de­bil­i­tat­ing short sup­ply.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201125,Peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­ment tonic to Zim’s trans­for­ma­tion,"IN his book, The Gov­er­nance of China III, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said the peo­ple were the great­est strength to gov­er­nance, the creators of his­tory, and the fun­da­men­tal force for de­ter­min­ing the fu­ture of the coun­try. He also said the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment came from the peo­ple, had its roots in the peo­ple and served the peo­ple. “Peo­ple are a vi­tal force in cham­pi­oning de­vel­op­ment. We are, there­fore, ad­dress­ing the most press­ing is­sues es­sen­tial to our peo­ple’s im­me­di­ate in­ter­ests to stim­u­late and achieve po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, so­cio-cul­tural, and eco-en­vi­ron­men­tal de­vel­op­ment,” Jin­ping said. “We al­ways put our peo­ple first, base our ef­forts on their in­ter­ests, lis­ten to them, draw on their wisdom, and en­sure the prin­ci­pal sta­tus of Chi­nese.” China has lifted over 700 mil­lion of its cit­i­zens from poverty be­cause of its peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­men­tal pro­grammes. As the Zim­bab­wean gov­ern­ment is push­ing to­wards at­tain­ing an up­per­mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030, it should not only strengthen the sys­tem of gov­er­nance but also fight poverty and in­equal­ity, and also put in place mea­sures to en­sure public well­be­ing. The gov­ern­ment should con­stantly im­prove the well­be­ing of Zim­bab­weans through pro­duc­tive in­vest­ment, the cre­ation of de­cent em­ploy­ment, the equal dis­tri­bu­tion of re­sources, and the pro­mo­tion and pro­tec­tion of fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights and free­doms. The big­gest prob­lems fac­ing the Zim­bab­wean so­ci­ety to­day in­clude vi­o­la­tion of hu­man rights and the widen­ing gap be­tween un­bal­anced and in­ad­e­quate de­vel­op­ment and the ever-grow­ing ex­pec­ta­tion of Zim­bab­weans for a bet­ter life. De­spite abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, the coun­try re­mains one of the poor­est States in Africa, with an un­em­ploy­ment and un­der­em­ploy­ment rate of around 95%. Be­cause of this, most Zim­bab­weans are liv­ing be­low the in­ter­na­tional poverty line of US$1,90 a day. Sys­temic cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment are also wors­en­ing the coun­try’s eco­nomic cri­sis. To fight cor­rup­tion and close the in­equal­ity gap, the gov­ern­ment should com­mit to the prin­ci­ple of serv­ing Zim­bab­weans whole­heart­edly over and above pro­mot­ing sus­tained, in­clu­sive, and fair so­cio-eco­nomic growth, job cre­ation, pro­duc­tive in­vest­ment, and trade. The United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP), the UN’s global de­vel­op­ment net­work, which pro­motes tech­ni­cal and in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion among na­tions, also said peo­ple’s well­be­ing and their qual­ity of life are an im­por­tant mea­sure of whether “in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment” is at­tain­able. “Peo­ple must be at the cen­tre of hu­man de­vel­op­ment, both as ben­e­fi­cia­ries and as driv­ers as in­di­vid­u­als and in groups,” UNDP noted, adding that states must em­power their cit­i­zens with the tools and knowl­edge to build bet­ter com­mu­ni­ties. For Croa­t­ian diplo­mat, politi­cian, and law scholar, Ivan Si­monovic, hu­man rights should be at the cen­tre of all peo­ple-cen­tred gov­er­nance and de­vel­op­ment ini­tia­tives be­cause they set min­i­mum stan­dards to en­cour­age bet­ter de­ci­sion-mak­ing and pro-poor out­comes. Si­monovic urged States like Zim­babwe to im­prove demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions, en­hance ac­count­abil­ity, trans­parency, and good gov­er­nance, and fight cor­rup­tion. “The re­sponse of the gov­ern­ment on po­lit­i­cal, so­cio-eco­nomic, and gen­der chal­lenges should be cred­i­ble and co­her­ent, with hu­man rights as the base­line,” he said. As Jin­ping clearly noted in his book, the gov­ern­ment should be close to peo­ple, and work vig­or­ously by their side through thick and thin to re­alise, safe­guard, and de­velop their fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights, free­doms, and in­ter­ests. Zim­bab­weans are suf­fer­ing be­cause of poverty, un­em­ploy­ment, and in­equal­ity — evils that feed on each other — and the gov­ern­ment should make gen­uine ef­forts to ad­dress these con­cerns and warm peo­ple’s hearts. In his book, A Fine Madness, writer Mashin­gaidze Gomo noted that Zim­babwe and other African States ur­gently needed poli­cies that gen­er­ate de­cent jobs which pay enough for peo­ple to sur­vive and thrive. De­cent jobs are con­ducive to so­cial co­he­sion and in­clu­sion and par­tic­i­pa­tion are es­sen­tial to sus­tained, in­clu­sive, and fair de­vel­op­ment. Gomo added that run­ning a re­source-rich coun­try like Zim­babwe was a mo­men­tous re­spon­si­bil­ity and as such the gov­ern­ment should fully com­mit to the peo­ple and never fail them. Fo­cus should be on poverty re­duc­tion, cri­sis pre­ven­tion and re­cov­ery, peo­ple-cen­tred gov­er­nance, and en­vi­ron­ment and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment. More so, gov­ern­ment lead­ers should put aside their in­ter­ests and de­vote their all to stim­u­late Zim­babwe’s po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, and so­cio­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment as well as en­hance the qual­ity of de­vel­op­ment to bet­ter meet the grow­ing ex­pec­ta­tions of Zim­bab­weans in all ar­eas.",津巴布韦

Zim­babwe has been im­ple­ment­ing poverty re­duc­tion strate­gies since 1980. Though we are faced with hu­man­i­tar­ian chal­lenges like other na­tions in the re­gion, in our case it has been wors­ened by il­le­gal sanc­tions, the neg­a­tive im­pact of cli­mate change, and cur­rently by the out­break of the Covid-19 pan­demic. We, how­ever, are forg­ing ahead in mak­ing sure our peo­ple are food se­cure,” the Pres­i­dent said. To en­hance food se­cu­rity, the Sec­ond Repub­lic un­der the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has taken prag­matic steps to im­prove agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity, through in­no­va­tive farm­ing con­cepts such as the Pfumvudza/Int­wasa pro­gramme, which will ben­e­fit at least two mil­lion house­holds, the mech­a­ni­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion of farm­ing as well as the pro­vi­sion of agri­cul­tural in­puts un­der the Pres­i­den­tial In­puts Scheme. Both the Pfumvudza and Farm Mech­a­ni­sa­tion schemes are meant to cli­mate-proof agri­cul­tural un­der the agri­cul­ture re­cov­ery plan which seeks to transform the sec­tor into an US$8,2 bil­lion in­dus­try by 2025. Apart from in­vest­ing in agri­cul­ture, the Sec­ond Repub­lic has also rolled out sev­eral self-em­pow­er­ment pro­grammes as it con­tin­ues to put in place mea­sures to im­prove the peo­ple’s wel­fare. “There is still a long way to go in pro­mot­ing com­pre­hen­sive devel­op­ment among our peo­ple. Ac­cord­ingly, sev­eral on­go­ing projects have been put in place, such as bak­eries, pro­duc­tion, hor­ti­cul­ture, min­ing and value ad­di­tion, pro­cess­ing and pack­ag­ing of mil­let, peanut but­ter, poul­try pig­gery, soap and lotion mak­ing and many other projects. “The party and Gov­ern­ment con­tin­u­ously eval­u­ate the suc­cesses and chal­lenges faced at all lev­els.

Zim­babwe has in­creased job cre­ation, through sev­eral projects cur­rently run­ning in all sec­tors, through­out the coun­try. Gov­ern­ment now has a larger per­cent­age em­ployed in the in­for­mal sec­tor, with a larger per­cent of women,” he said. The Pres­i­dent said in pur­suit of erad­i­cat­ing poverty, Gov­ern­ment has also im­proved ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion across all sec­tors from, Early Child­hood Devel­op­ment (ECD), pri­mary and sec­ondary, uni­ver­si­ties, teach­ers’ col­leges and in­dus­trial train­ing cen­tres. “Most of all the ed­u­ca­tion fa­cil­i­ties have been elec­tri­fied and com­put­erised”. Turn­ing to the cru­cial health sec­tor, the Pres­i­dent said the Gov­ern­ment “has built and re­ha­bil­i­tated sev­eral hos­pi­tals and clin­ics, both in ur­ban and ru­ral ar­eas”. “To this end, new equip­ment has been pro­vided and old ones re­fur­bished.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191202,The long march to pros­per­ity,"CHINA raised 800 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty over the last 40 years. That is like rais­ing 20 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty ev­ery year for 40 years. The gov­ern­ment of China has con­sis­tently made a po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment to re­duc­ing poverty. Their eco­nomic plans are driven by peo­ple-cen­tred poverty re­duc­tion goals and plans. Are there any lessons that Zim­babwe can learn from this? Can the en­tire Zim­bab­wean pop­u­la­tion be raised out of poverty in one year? How did the Chi­nese achieve this feat? The long march to pros­per­ity To ex­plore this dy­namic, I will go back to the events of 1934, in a small vil­lage called Zunyi. It marks the be­gin­ning of the long march. And the be­gin­ning of the rise of one of the most enig­matic lead­ers in the his­tory of mankind. With his rise to power, China dis­cov­ered peo­ple power. It also con­nected with the peo­ple-cen­tred val­ues which still un­der­pin its world­view to this day. Noth­ing de­fines China like the long March and Mao Ze Dong. Noth­ing has left a su­pe­rior im­print on the psy­che of the Chi­nese peo­ple. In 1979, the great Deng Xiaop­ing de­clared that get­ting rich is glo­ri­ous. It was the flow­er­ing of a tree planted more than four decades ear­lier. Vi­sion­ary trans­for­ma­tional lead­er­ship, the great helms­man The leg­endary Mao Ze Dong be­strides the his­tory of China like a colos­sus. He ruled far more peo­ple, for far much longer and with greater au­thor­ity than any­body else that has ever ex­isted. What makes this man special? In 1934, when he took over lead­er­ship of the Com­mu­nist Party of China, the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army was fac­ing an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis. The Na­tion­al­ist forces had dec­i­mated the Com­mu­nists. The only chance of sur­vival lay in flee­ing 1 200 kilo­me­tres to the north on foot. It was dur­ing this ar­du­ous jour­ney that Mao’s ge­nius flour­ished. Put­ting peo­ple val­ues at the cen­tre of all the op­er­a­tions of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army made it stronger, more ef­fec­tive and re­silient. Sac­ri­fic­ing the Chi­nese Lib­er­a­tion Army in con­fronta­tional bat­tles to gain ter­ri­tory was sui­ci­dal and coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. The Chi­nese Lib­er­a­tion Army had in­fe­rior re­sources and weapons. It could never win pitched con­fronta­tional bat­tles against the na­tion­al­ists. Align­ing with peo­ple val­ues The smart op­tion, in­stead, was to con­cen­trate on cre­at­ing con­di­tions that favoured the com­mu­nists. To fight only those bat­tles that the com­mu­nists knew they could win. “Weapons are an im­por­tant fac­tor in war, but not the de­ci­sive one; it is man and not ma­te­ri­als that counts” Mao said. In other words, the man who car­ried the gun, was a It was dur­ing the 1 200km long march (above) that Mao ze Dong’s ge­nius flour­ished. RIGHT: In­sur­ance guru Paul Mkondo much more valu­able rev­o­lu­tion­ary re­source than the gun. Los­ing trained cadres was a se­ri­ous set­back for the revo­lu­tion. Trained men could not be eas­ily re­placed. Whereas ter­ri­tory could be re­gained. Com­mu­nist sol­diers were like fish in wa­ter. They de­pended on the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion for food, se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence. To alien­ate the peo­ple was to com­mit sui­cide. To crown it all, Mao de­fined the fight­ing process; when the en­emy ad­vances we re­treat; when the en­emy camps, we ha­rass; the en­emy tires we at­tack; the en­emy re­treats, we pur­sue. This was as neat a sum­ma­tion of process as any­one will ever come up with in war or in busi­ness. Defin­ing your peo­ple-driven vi­sion In times of cri­sis, the great­est job of lead­ers is to de­fine pri­or­i­ties. Lead­ers must get rid of am­bi­gu­i­ties and con­tra­dic­tions. Am­bi­gu­i­ties and con­tra­dic­tions sap en­ergy and de­ter progress. This must be done with as much clar­ity and vi­sion as pos­si­ble. The vi­sion must res­onate with the peo­ple. It must de­fine a fu­ture that peo­ple want to be­long to. As Mao him­self puts it: “The peo­ple, and the peo­ple alone, are the mo­tive force in the mak­ing of world his­tory.” In other words, a vi­sion must align with peo­ple val­ues. This is not a mat­ter of char­ity. It is the key to sur­vival. Stag­ing un­fair fight Mao knew how to set up and or­ches­trate an un­fair fight. He knew how to en­sure that he and his peo­ple were al­ways on the win­ning side. In­fe­rior weapons and lack of re­sources was not an ex­cuse. And China today, thanks to Mao, is cham­pi­oning a new kind of cap­i­tal­ism. A cap­i­tal­ism that fo­cuses on get­ting peo­ple out of poverty. There was a time on ra­dio, when ev­ery Sun­day morn­ing, the boom­ing voice of Paul Mkondo ex­torted us to buy in­sur­ance. In those days, ev­ery teacher and ev­ery civil ser­vant had at least two in­sur­ance poli­cies. And then the wheels came off. In 2009, pol­i­cy­hold­ers and pen­sion fund con­trib­u­tors lost 100 per­cent of their pen­sion and in­sur­ance ben­e­fits. This left a big dent on the cred­i­bil­ity of the fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try. As if this was not enough, we are re­peat­ing the process as we speak. Peo­ple who put away sav­ings in US dol­lars have seen their sav­ings re­duced to less than five per­cent of the value that they put away. What­ever cred­i­bil­ity the in­dus­try sal­vaged in 2009, lies in tat­ters. Like the Com­mu­nist Party in 1934, the non-bank­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try in Zim­babwe faces an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis. Cus­tomers are de­sert­ing in droves. Skilled work­ers are leav­ing for bet­ter work­ing con­di­tions in for­eign coun­tries. The time to de­fine a peo­ple-cen­tred vi­sion that res­onates with the fu­ture is now. Con­clu­sion In con­clu­sion, it is time to de­fine the value that the non-bank­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices in­dus­try brings to this coun­try and its peo­ple. The be­gin­ning of a long march to­wards pros­per­ity be­gins by recog­nis­ing the cen­tral role of the fi­nan­cial ser­vices worker and the fi­nan­cial ser­vices cus­tomer. Zim­babwe can em­u­late China by rais­ing half a mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty each year for the next 40 years.",津巴布韦

Why space ex­plo­ration? Are we not wast­ing re­sources by pur­su­ing such grand sci­en­tific projects? Well, hu­man cu­rios­ity will con­tinue to ex­ist in the midst of poverty, disease, in­equal­ity or war. Those with the cash will use their re­sources to ad­dress to ex­plore, ex­per­i­ment and ven­ture into the un­known. What will be pru­dent is to pur­sue a mul­ti­pur­pose agenda where sci­ence is used to ad­dress cu­rios­ity but also to solve ex­ist­ing prob­lems. More im­por­tantly, the sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy de­vel­oped from the pur­suit of cu­rios­ity (such as space ex­plo­ration) can be ap­plied to solve ur­gent and press­ing hu­man prob­lems. It is a dy­namic process. Given the neg­a­tive ex­pe­ri­ences (to Africans and oth­ers) of past voy­ages and dis­cov­er­ies, this plunge into space ex­plo­ration should be co­op­er­a­tive. How­ever, no one will in­volve the African if we do not pull our re­sources to­gether and as­sert agency as a united and in­te­grated con­ti­nent. Short of that, we will re­main noisy by­standers and ob­servers, if not vic­tims. China and In­dia are out there pay­ing the space game. Here are their strengths China: 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple and GDP US$ 14,3 tril­lion; In­dia: 1,37 bil­lion peo­ple and GDP of US$2,9 tril­lion. If Africans work as one mar­ket (or coun­try), our strength is: 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple and col­lec­tive GDP of US$2,5 tril­lion. This is what we should lever­age as ONE en­tity and not frag­mented and non-vi­able states. Only as such a vast in­te­grated econ­omy can a united Africa par­tic­i­pate in th­ese co­op­er­a­tive sci­en­tific ad­ven­tures and dis­cov­er­ies, not as small and in­con­se­quen­tial states such as Zim­babwe, South Africa, Botswana or Nige­ria. We must unite in pur­suit of high tech­nol­ogy and ad­vanced sci­ence. Con­clu­sion The land­ing of the Per­se­ver­ance Mars Rover is both an in­struc­tive in­spi­ra­tion and a pro­found demon­stra­tion of the un­bounded na­ture of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy ap­pli­ca­tions. As Africans, we must be in­spired, em­brace sci­ence and de­ploy tech­nol­ogy to solve our many de­vel­op­men­tal prob­lems. This am­bi­tion can be best ac­com­plished as one coun­try, the United States. Af­ter thought Well, is the US a re­al­is­tic propo­si­tion? In­deed, it is a daunt­ing but ex­is­ten­tial propo­si­tion. There were mas­sive dif­fi­cul­ties that the US, China, In­dia and USSR (later Rus­sia) went through to es­tab­lish their pow­er­ful and com­pet­i­tive na­tions. The cre­ation of those su­per-states was rooted in, and an­chored by, im­mense sac­ri­fice and strug­gle. No pain, no gain. Noth­ing ever comes from soft ground. With­out sac­ri­fice and strug­gle, there will be no progress. We have to give up on nar­row na­tional sovereignty, lim­ited na­tional agen­das and mean­ing­less na­tional pres­i­den­cies (55 of them!) to em­brace the United States of Africa. Most of th­ese African lead­ers — our Pres­i­dents and Prime Min­is­ters — and their peo­ple are not pre­pared for this. In fact, the African lead­ers pay lip ser­vice to re­gional (South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity, East African Com­mu­nity, Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity of West African States, etc.) and con­ti­nen­tal (African Union, African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area, New Part­ner­ship for Africa’s De­vel­op­ment, etc.) de­ci­sions. They meet, make im­por­tant re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal de­ci­sions, take a group pic­ture and re­vert to na­tional plans and vi­sions when back in their coun­tries. The grand re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal projects are not im­ple­mented. They are not even re­ferred to in na­tional dis­course or re­flected in na­tional bud­gets. Tragic! Clearly, there is need to demon­strate that the US’ ben­e­fits and ef­fi­cacy out­weigh the na­tional sac­ri­fices. More im­por­tantly, it is essen­tial to ex­plain that the US’ cre­ation is a mat­ter of African sur­vival and not choice. Un­der glob­al­i­sa­tion and the 4IR, we will only flour­ish and pros­per as a po­lit­i­cally united and eco­nom­i­cally in­te­grated con­ti­nent. Need­less to say, all this will re­quire prin­ci­pled, ded­i­cated and vi­sion­ary PanAfrican lead­ers, who are sadly in de­bil­i­tat­ing short sup­ply.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210222,Covid -19 vac­cine hoard­ing may pro­long pan­demic,"LON­DON. – As the coron­avirus con­tin­ues to spread around the world, with new, more in­fec­tious vari­ants com­pli­cat­ing re­sponses to out­breaks, gov­ern­ments are rac­ing to roll out vac­ci­na­tions. With more than 57 mil­lion vac­cine doses ad­min­is­tered, the United States is lead­ing the way in the to­tal num­ber of shots ad­min­is­tered, fol­lowed by China and the Euro­pean Union. The United Arab Emi­rates and Is­rael have ad­min­is­tered at least one dose to the high­est pro­por­tion of their pop­u­la­tions, 81 and 54 per­cent re­spec­tively. In com­par­i­son, lower- and mid­dle-in­come economies have strug­gled. Ad­dress­ing the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil on Wed­nes­day, UN Sec­re­taryGen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said a to­tal of 130 coun­tries had not ad­min­is­tered a sin­gle dose. The stark dis­par­ity in vac­ci­na­tion rates be­tween high- and low-in­come economies has led the UN to call for greater vac­cine eq­uity on a global scale and re­new warn­ings against so-called “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” and “vac­cine hoard­ing”. In his ad­dress to the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, Guter­res slammed the global dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines as “wildly un­even and un­fair”, not­ing that 10 coun­tries have ad­min­is­tered 75 per­cent of all vac­cine doses. “At this crit­i­cal mo­ment, vac­cine eq­uity is the big­gest moral test be­fore the global com­mu­nity,” he said. On Fri­day, UK Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son pledged to give “the ma­jor­ity of any fu­ture sur­plus vac­cines” to the UN-backed COVAX vac­cine shar­ing ini­tia­tive, de­signed to pro­vide doses to lower-in­come coun­tries. Shortly af­ter the first cases of COVID-19 were re­ported in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan in late 2019, sci­en­tists be­gan work to de­velop vac­cines to pro­tect against the coron­avirus. Global health ex­perts warned that any vac­cines should be made avail­able equally to all coun­tries. Within months, high-in­come coun­tries had struck deals with drug com­pa­nies work­ing on vac­cine can­di­dates, se­cur­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of fu­ture doses. “Rich coun­tries have signed pre-pur­chase agree­ments with vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers,” Ge­orge­town Law global health pro­fes­sor Lawrence Gostin said. “So [they] have bought up most of the world’s vac­cine sup­plies.” Ac­cord­ing to ONE, a group that cam­paigns against poverty, peo­ple from lower-in­come coun­tries may not be able to be vac­ci­nated this year be­cause the world’s rich­est coun­tries have bought one bil­lion more doses than their cit­i­zens need. Some coun­tries have se­cured enough sup­plies to vac­ci­nate their pop­u­la­tions more than once. The coun­tries with the most cov­er­age per capita are: Canada with 500 per­cent of its pop­u­la­tion cov­ered, the United King­dom with 327 per­cent, Chile with 244 per­cent, New Zealand with 242 per­cent and Aus­tralia with 226 per­cent. The rush to se­cure a wide range of vac­cines early was par­tially driven by a lack of knowl­edge as to which vac­cines would prove ef­fec­tive against the virus. Gostin noted that gov­ern­ments also face po­lit­i­cal pres­sure to pro­tect their pop­u­la­tions first. “Gov­ern­ments are un­der enor­mous pres­sure to pri­ori­tise their own pop­u­la­tions. So, pri­ori­tis­ing one’s own pop­u­la­tion is un­der­stand­able,” he said. “But all hu­man be­ings have equal worth, and the self­ish hoard­ing of vac­cines is, in my opin­ion, un­eth­i­cal,” Gostin said. North­east­ern Uni­ver­sity School of Law Pro­fes­sor Brook Baker said that in­oc­u­lat­ing the pop­u­la­tion of a sin­gle coun­try would not pro­tect them if it meant that the virus con­tin­ues to spread else­where unchecked. “You’re not pro­tect­ing your cit­i­zens; you’re giv­ing your cit­i­zens an il­lu­sion that you’re pro­tect­ing them,” Baker said. – Al Jazeera.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20210307,Ev­ery great party has a party-pooper,"THE hall­mark of good lead­er­ship is tak­ing peo­ple where they ought to be in­stead of where they want to be. Some­times what peo­ple need is more im­por­tant than what they want. How­ever, giv­ing peo­ple what they need — and not what they want — can be thor­oughly un­pop­u­lar. Iron­i­cally, while po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal comes from pop­u­lar­ity, po­lit­i­cal ef­fec­tive­ness is of­ten shaped by un­pop­u­lar de­ci­sions. It is pre­cisely this co­nun­drum that makes many politi­cians fail. It, there­fore, takes in­cred­i­ble bold­ness and steely re­solve to lead. In­cred­i­ble bold­ness In De­cem­ber 1994, China em­barked on per­haps the big­gest project it had ever un­der­taken since con­struc­tion of the Great Wall of China — the Three Gorges Dam. You see, at the time, China, which was now grow­ing at break­neck speed af­ter more than a decade of Deng Xiaop­ing-in­spired re­forms, needed power to sup­port its bur­geon­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties. It wanted to tame the roar­ing Yangtze River — the third long­est af­ter the Nile and the Ama­zon — and pro­tect down­stream ri­par­ian com­mu­ni­ties from the ever-present spec­tre of flood­ing. A painful les­son had been learnt 40 years ear­lier (in 1954) when floods claimed more than 30 000 lives. So it was only log­i­cal that damming the river would nat­u­rally con­trol the flow of wa­ter and in­su­late vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties from un­wanted del­uges. In both scope and mag­ni­tude, the project was as am­bi­tious as it was ex­tra­or­di­nary. At 181 me­tres tall and span­ning over 2 335 me­tres (2,3 kilo­me­tres) across the river, the dam was not only a re­mark­able en­gi­neer­ing feat but a fig­u­ra­tive and lit­eral source and sym­bol of China’s grow­ing power and in­flu­ence. By 2008 when the mon­ster dam was com­pleted, it pumped more than 18 300 megawatts (MW) to the grid. Ad­di­tional hy­dro units were added in 2012, which made it pos­si­ble for the plant to pro­duce 22 500MW. Not sur­pris­ingly, it is cur­rently the largest hy­dro­elec­tric power project in the world. Just for per­spec­tive, the Grand Ethiopian Re­nais­sance Dam (GERD) be­ing con­structed by Ethiopia along the Nile River — which has be­come the source of a rag­ing feud be­tween Ad­dis Ababa and Cairo (Egypt) — will only be able to gen­er­ate about 6 000MW. The United States’ Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (NASA) claims that the Three Gorges Dam is one of the few man-made struc­tures that it is so enor­mous that it is vis­i­ble to the naked eye from space. In­cred­i­ble! This, how­ever, does not mean the project was in­ci­dent-free. As is al­ways the norm, ev­ery great party al­ways has a party-pooper. Bishop Lazarus re­mem­bers these char­ac­ters all too well. In the vil­lage, they came in the form of rest­less chaps who of­ten got so sloshed at com­mu­nal fund-rais­ing beer-drink­ing gath­er­ings (ndari) that they had this in­ex­pli­ca­ble streak of tip­ping over beer cal­abashes, par­tic­u­larly just at the very mo­ment when the gath­er­ing be­came mer­rily an­i­mated. Some­how these mishaps or freak ac­ci­dents hap­pened when the al­co­hol-tranced and jelly-kneed drunk­ards tried to ex­e­cute dance rou­tines to ac­com­pany the imag­i­nary mu­sic play­ing in their head. Kikikiki Of­ten­times, the mis­guided and tru­ant leg would land — bulls-eye — in the cal­abash, at­tract­ing mur­murs of dis­ap­proval and dis­gust from fel­low im­bibers. Af­ter per­form­ing this un­spec­tac­u­lar and un­a­mus­ing stunt, the per­pe­tra­tors, who would also in­vari­ably clum­sily fall over, al­ways played pos­sum to es­cape with­er­ing con­dem­na­tion from their peers. Nat­u­rally, a project as grand and con­se­quen­tial as the Three Gorges Dam at­tracted count­less party-poop­ers who were hell-bent on throw­ing span­ners in the works by whip­ping up emo­tions stirred by the im­mense so­cial up­heaval it caused. More that 1,9 mil­lion peo­ple from about 1 400 ru­ral towns and vil­lages were dis­placed, while close to 1 600 fac­to­ries were also af­fected by the project. Ac­tivists smelled an op­por­tu­nity and sprouted overnight. In no time, there were ac­tivists who were ag­i­tat­ing for species such as the Chi­nese river dol­phin; there were ac­tivists who stood for the preser­va­tion of his­tor­i­cal and ar­chae­o­log­i­cal sites; there were ac­tivists who ad­vo­cated for the en­vi­ron­ment; there were ac­tivists who pur­ported to be pro­tect­ing Chi­nese pro­duc­tive farm­lands; and there was also a pha­lanx of ac­tivists os­ten­si­bly rep­re­sent­ing the in­ter­ests of af­fected fam­i­lies. In fact, ac­tivists of ev­ery shape and hue crawled from ev­ery nook and cranny. A Cana­dian en­vi­ron­men­tal group, Probe In­ter­na­tional, was no­tably crit­i­cal of the project by claim­ing that in­un­dat­ing com­mu­ni­ties and fac­to­ries with the en­vis­aged reser­voir would re­sult in a near-apoc­a­lypse from chem­i­cals and other sim­i­lar pol­lu­tants. In­ter­na­tional fi­nanciers such as the World Bank de­cided not to fund the project, and so did the US Ex­port-Im­port Bank. De­ter­mined Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, how­ever, man­aged to bankroll it from re­sources gen­er­ated from spe­cial taxes on con­sump­tion, in­clud­ing rev­enues from the first phase of the project. Suf­fice to say that a decade af­ter the com­ple­tion of the dam, none of the fears raised by crit­ics ever came to pass. In­stead, China has since cat­a­pulted it­self to be­come the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy and man­aged to lift more than 900 mil­lion of its 1,3 bil­lion cit­i­zens out of poverty. None of this could have been pos­si­ble if the Chi­nese didn’t know how to bal­ance per­sonal and na­tional in­ter­ests. Bishop Lazi was par­tic­u­larly touched by an ar­ti­cle on the Three Gorges Dam writ­ten by US jour­nal­ist Aurthur Zich (who sadly died in 2012) for the Na­tional Ge­o­graphic’s Septem­ber 1997 is­sue. Dur­ing his odyssey to China to get an ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the project, he came across and in­ter­viewed Zheng Xin­nian, who was one of the mul­ti­tudes who had been af­fected by the dis­place­ments. Zheng fa­mously re­marked: “I will for­ever miss the place we have lived for gen­er­a­tions. But we must sac­ri­fice per­sonal in­ter­est for the good of the coun­try.” But it would be disin­gen­u­ous to say all those who were af­fected by the project were thrilled by it. You see, some­times angst and anx­i­ety make peo­ple fret­ful. Op­por­tunists This seems to be the same up­heaval that has vis­ited the Chi­longa com­mu­nity of Chiredzi, where a sprawl­ing lucerne grass project, which is meant to feed the coun­try’s dairy sec­tor as well as gen­er­ate ex­ports, is set to be­gin. Some fam­i­lies will def­i­nitely have to make way for the huge un­der­tak­ing, which will straddle over 12 000 hectares. Un­be­known to the ac­tivists who are now seek to whip up emo­tions to be­smirch the ini­tia­tive, en­cour­ag­ing en­gage­ments be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, the com­mu­nity and the in­vestor have been on­go­ing for more than a year now. A sig­nif­i­cant cap­i­tal out­lay for their re­set­tle­ment — not evic­tion — has al­ready been set aside. What these ac­tivists need to con­sider the next time they walk into a su­per­mar­ket to buy milk is that the bulk of it — about 60 mil­lion litres — is be­ing im­ported from other coun­tries, as lo­cal farm­ers can only pro­duce 70 mil­lion of the 130 mil­lion litres de­manded lo­cally. Through the en­vis­aged in­vest­ment, lucerne grass, which is proven to be a “magic in­gre­di­ent” that im­proves the health of dairy cows and boosts milk pro­duc­tion, will sup­ply feed for dairy farm­ers and com­mu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing ex­port mar­kets. It also has the po­ten­tial of im­prov­ing the ma­te­rial well-be­ing of Chi­longa through out­grower schemes. For the Bishop, such kind of so­cial up­heavals are a sign of devel­op­ment-in­duced dis­place­ment, which is a key in­di­ca­tor that sus­tain­able eco­nomic devel­op­ment is be­gin­ning to take root. Just re­cently, the Gov­ern­ment re­leased close to $3 mil­lion to re­lo­cate fam­i­lies that had been af­fected by the con­struc­tion of Cause­way Dam in Maron­dera, whose com­mis­sion­ing is now im­mi­nent. As the Gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues to plough ahead with its devel­op­ment agenda, such dis­rup­tions will not be un­com­mon — which is a good thing. Some­times, it is im­por­tant to take time to un­der­stand sit­u­a­tions be­fore hastily com­ing up with mislead­ing con­clu­sions. Proverbs 14:19 says, “Who­ever is slow to anger has great un­der­stand­ing, but he who has a hasty tem­per ex­alts folly.” Proverbs 4:6-9 adds: “Do not for­sake wis­dom, and she will pro­tect you; love her, and she will watch over you. The be­gin­ning of wis­dom is this: Get wis­dom. Though it cost all you have, get un­der­stand­ing. Cher­ish her, and she will ex­alt you; em­brace her, and she will hon­our you. “She will give you a gar­land to grace your head and present you with a glo­ri­ous crown.” The dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paign of the Chi­longa project by MDC-A rag­tag shock-troop­ers, who thought they could use an­other hash­tag for cheap po­lit­i­cal point-scor­ing, was quite fas­ci­nat­ing. How­ever, it was not un­ex­pected. For a party that no longer has a build­ing to call home, their mem­bers now have no op­tion but to loi­ter on so­cial me­dia plat­forms look­ing for the small­est of de­tails that they could pos­si­bly use to con­trive pub­lic out­rage. When will they learn that hash­tags are just ephemeral? Like morn­ing dew, they dis­si­pate with the ris­ing sun. Bishop out!",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200610,Poverty da­tum line rises,"ZIM­BABWE’S poverty da­tum line ( PDL) in­creased to $7 426 in April from $6 421 in March, the Zim­babwe Na­tional Statis­tics Agency (Zim­stat), re­vealed on Mon­day. The data shows that fi­nan­cial re­quire­ments for a fam­ily of five to live a ba­sic com­fort­able life and not be deemed poor con­tin­ued to go up while the econ­omy is un­der a Covid-19 lock­down. Given that year-on-year in­fla­tion for April was 765 per­cent, in­di­ca­tions are the for May is likely to surge for­ward. PDL “The To­tal Con­sump­tion Poverty Line for one per­son dur­ing the same pe­riod was $1 485,16 while that for an av­er­age of five per­sons per house­hold stood at $7 425,81,” Zim­stat said. The rise in the cost of liv­ing re­flects the im­pact of in­fla­tion caused mainly by ex­change rate in­sta­bil­ity which has seen the lo­cal cur­rency lose its value against the United States dol­lar. While Gov­ern­ment fixed the ex­change rate at $25 to US$ 1, prices, due to short­ages of for­eign cur­rency on the of­fi­cial mar­ket, are largely in­flu­enced by the par­al­lel mar­ket where the rate is over $60 per green­back. The In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( ILO) rec­om­mends that the should be used PDL as a bench­mark or ref­er­ence point in de­ter­min­ing min­i­mum wages. How­ever, in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, wage growth is lag­ging be­hind in­fla­tion and em­ploy­ers and work­ers are up in arms over salaries and wages ad­just­ment. Most work­ers’ salaries are about half the PDL, leav­ing them strug­gling to make ends meet. The sit­u­a­tion for both Gov­ern­ment and pri­vate com­pa­nies has been com­pounded by the cur­rent Covid-19 lock­down that has forced com­pa­nies to scale down op­er­a­tions, lay off some work­ers or cut their salaries. The lock­down is aimed at curb­ing spread of the deadly disease. Global value chains have also been af­fected as coun­tries closed their bor­ders to for­eign­ers while some pas­sen­ger air­lines have been grounded save for cargo. Given the in­ter­de­pen­dence cre­ated by glob­al­i­sa­tion, many coun­tries will strug­gle for a long time to be self-re­liance post Covid-19. An­a­lysts say Covid-19 has ex­posed many coun­tries that were over reliant on China, and, mov­ing on, au­thor­i­ties should come up with sus­tain­able home grown so­lu­tions to han­dle na­tional eco­nomic chal­lenges.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200925,Hu­man­ity will win Covid-19 bat­tle!,"MR Pres­i­dent, Col­leagues. This year marks the 75th an­niver­sary of the vic­tory in the World Anti-Fas­cist War and the found­ing of the United Na­tions (UN). Yes­ter­day, the high-level meet­ing to com­mem­o­rate the 75th an­niver­sary of the UN was held. The meet­ing was a sig­nif­i­cant one, as it reaf­firmed our abid­ing com­mit­ment to the pur­poses and prin­ci­ples of the UN Char­ter on the ba­sis of re­view­ing the his­tor­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence and lessons of the World Anti-Fas­cist War. Mr Pres­i­dent, We hu­mans are bat­tling Covid-19, a virus that has rav­aged the world and has kept resurg­ing. In this fight, we have wit­nessed the ef­forts of gov­ern­ments, ded­i­ca­tion of med­i­cal work­ers, ex­plo­ration of sci­en­tists, and per­se­ver­ance of the pub­lic. Peo­ple of dif­fer­ent coun­tries have come to­gether. With courage, re­solve and com­pas­sion which lit the dark hour, we have con­fronted the dis­as­ter head on. The virus will be de­feated. Hu­man­ity will win this bat­tle! ◆ Fac­ing the virus, we should put peo­ple and life first. We should mo­bilise all re­sources to make a science-based and tar­geted re­sponse. No case should be missed and no pa­tient should be left un­treated. The spread of the virus must be con­tained. ◆ Fac­ing the virus, we should en­hance sol­i­dar­ity and get this through to­gether. We should fol­low the guid­ance of science, give full play to the lead­ing role of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, and launch a joint in­ter­na­tional re­sponse to beat this pan­demic. Any at­tempt of politi­cis­ing the is­sue or stig­ma­ti­sa­tion must be re­jected. ◆ Fac­ing the virus, we should adopt com­pre­hen­sive and long-term con­trol mea­sures. We should re­open busi­nesses and schools in an or­derly way, so as to cre­ate jobs, boost the econ­omy, and re­store eco­nomic and so­cial or­der and vi­tal­ity. The ma­jor economies need to step up macro pol­icy co­or­di­na­tion. We should not only restart our own economies, but also con­trib­ute to global re­cov­ery. ◆ Fac­ing the virus, we should show con­cern for and ac­com­mo­date the need of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, es­pe­cially African coun­tries. The in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity needs to take timely and ro­bust mea­sures in such fields as debt re­lief and in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance, en­sure the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment and help these coun­tries over­come their dif­fi­cul­ties. Seventy-five years ago, China made his­toric con­tri­bu­tions to win­ning the World Anti-Fas­cist War and sup­ported the found­ing of the United Na­tions. To­day, with the same sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity, China is ac­tively in­volved in the in­ter­na­tional fight against Covid-19, con­tribut­ing its share to up­hold­ing global pub­lic health se­cu­rity. Go­ing for­ward, we will con­tinue to share our epi­demic con­trol prac­tices as well as di­ag­nos­tics and ther­a­peu­tics with other coun­tries, pro­vide sup­port and as­sis­tance to coun­tries in need, en­sure sta­ble global anti-epi­demic sup­ply chains, and ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in the global re­search on trac­ing the source and trans­mis­sion routes of the virus. At the mo­ment, sev­eral Covid-19 vac­cines de­vel­oped by China are in Phase III clin­i­cal tri­als. When their de­vel­op­ment is com­pleted and they are avail­able for use, these vac­cines will be made a global pub­lic good, and they will be pro­vided to other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries on a pri­or­ity ba­sis. China will hon­our its com­mit­ment of pro­vid­ing US$2 bil­lion of in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance over two years, fur­ther in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion in such fields as agri­cul­ture, poverty re­duc­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, women and chil­dren, and cli­mate change, and sup­port other coun­tries in restor­ing eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. Mr Pres­i­dent, the his­tory of de­vel­op­ment of hu­man so­ci­ety is a his­tory of our strug­gles against all chal­lenges and dif­fi­cul­ties and our vic­to­ries over them. At present, the world is bat­tling the Covid19 pan­demic as it goes through pro­found changes never seen in a cen­tury. Yet, peace and de­vel­op­ment re­main the un­der­ly­ing trend of the times, and peo­ple ev­ery­where crave even more strongly for peace, de­vel­op­ment and win-win co­op­er­a­tion. Covid-19 will not be the last cri­sis to con­front hu­man­ity, so we must join hands and be pre­pared to meet even more global chal­lenges. First, Covid-19 re­minds us that we are liv­ing in an in­ter­con­nected global vil­lage with a com­mon stake. All coun­tries are closely con­nected and we share a com­mon fu­ture. No coun­try can gain from oth­ers’ dif­fi­cul­ties or main­tain sta­bil­ity by tak­ing ad­van­tage of oth­ers’ trou­bles. To pur­sue a beg­gar-thy-neigh­bour pol­icy or just watch from a safe dis­tance when oth­ers are in dan­ger will even­tu­ally land one in the same trou­ble faced by oth­ers. This is why we should em­brace the vi­sion of a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture in which ev­ery­one is bound to­gether. We should re­ject at­tempts to build blocs to keep oth­ers out and op­pose a zero-sum ap­proach. We should see each other as mem­bers of the same big fam­ily, pur­sue win-win co­op­er­a­tion, and rise above ide­o­log­i­cal dis­putes and do not fall into the trap of “clash of civil­i­sa­tions”. More im­por­tantly, we should re­spect a coun­try’s in­de­pen­dent choice of de­vel­op­ment path and model. The world is di­verse in na­ture, and we should turn this di­ver­sity into a con­stant source of inspiration driv­ing hu­man ad­vance­ment. This will en­sure that hu­man civil­i­sa­tions re­main colour­ful and di­ver­si­fied. Sec­ond, Covid-19 re­minds us that eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion is an in­dis­putable re­al­ity and a his­tor­i­cal trend. Bury­ing one’s head in the sand like an os­trich in the face of eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion or try­ing to fight it with Don Quixote’s lance goes against the trend of his­tory. Let this be clear: The world will never re­turn to iso­la­tion, and no one can sever the ties be­tween coun­tries. We should not dodge the chal­lenges of eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion. In­stead, we must face up to ma­jor is­sues such as the wealth gap and the de­vel­op­ment di­vide. We should strike a proper bal­ance be­tween the govern­ment and the mar­ket, fair­ness and ef­fi­ciency, growth and in­come dis­tri­bu­tion, and tech­nol­ogy and em­ploy­ment so as to en­sure full and bal­anced de­vel­op­ment that de­liv­ers ben­e­fit to peo­ple from all coun­tries, sec­tors and back­grounds in an eq­ui­table way. We should pur­sue open and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment, re­main com­mit­ted to build­ing an open world econ­omy, and up­hold the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing regime with the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion as the cor­ner­stone. We should say no to uni­lat­er­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism, and work to en­sure the sta­ble and smooth func­tion­ing of global in­dus­trial and sup­ply chains. Third, Covid-19 re­minds us that hu­mankind should launch a green revo­lu­tion and move faster to cre­ate a green way of de­vel­op­ment and life, pre­serve the en­vi­ron­ment and make Mother Earth a bet­ter place for all. Hu­mankind can no longer af­ford to ig­nore the re­peated warn­ings of Na­ture and go down the beaten path of ex­tract­ing re­sources with­out in­vest­ing in con­ser­va­tion, pur­su­ing de­vel­op­ment at the ex­pense of pro­tec­tion, and ex­ploit­ing re­sources with­out restora­tion. The Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change charts the course for the world to tran­si­tion to green and low-car­bon de­vel­op­ment. It out­lines the min­i­mum steps to be taken to pro­tect the Earth, our shared home­land, and all coun­tries must take de­ci­sive steps to hon­our this Agree­ment. China will scale up its In­tended Na­tion­ally De­ter­mined Con­tri­bu­tions by adopt­ing more vig­or­ous poli­cies and mea­sures. We aim to have CO2 emis­sions peak be­fore 2030 and achieve car­bon neu­tral­ity be­fore 2060. We call on all coun­tries to pur­sue in­no­va­tive, co­or­di­nated, green and open de­vel­op­ment for all, seize the his­toric op­por­tu­ni­ties pre­sented by the new round of sci­en­tific and tech­no­log­i­cal revo­lu­tion and in­dus­trial trans­for­ma­tion, achieve a green re­cov­ery of the world econ­omy in the post-Covid-19 era and thus cre­ate a pow­er­ful force driv­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Fourth, Covid-19 re­minds us that the global gov­er­nance sys­tem calls for re­form and im­prove­ment. Covid-19 is a ma­jor test of the gov­er­nance ca­pac­ity of coun­tries; it is also a test of the global gov­er­nance sys­tem. We should stay true to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and safe­guard the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem with the UN at its core. Global gov­er­nance should be based on the prin­ci­ple of ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion, joint co­op­er­a­tion and shared ben­e­fits so as to en­sure that all coun­tries en­joy equal rights and op­por­tu­ni­ties and fol­low the same rules. The global gov­er­nance sys­tem should adapt it­self to evolving global po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic dy­nam­ics, meet global chal­lenges and em­brace the un­der­ly­ing trend of peace, de­vel­op­ment and win-win co­op­er­a­tion. It is nat­u­ral for coun­tries to have dif­fer­ences. What’s im­por­tant is to ad­dress them through di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion. Coun­tries may en­gage in com­pe­ti­tion, but such com­pe­ti­tion should be pos­i­tive and healthy in na­ture. When in com­pe­ti­tion, coun­tries should not breach the moral stan­dard and should com­ply with in­ter­na­tional norms. In par­tic­u­lar, ma­jor coun­tries should act like ma­jor coun­tries. They should pro­vide more global pub­lic goods, take up their due re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and live up to peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions. Mr Pres­i­dent, since the start of this year, we, the 1,4 bil­lion Chi­nese, un­daunted by the strike of Covid- 19, and with the govern­ment and the peo­ple united as one, have made all- out ef­forts to con­trol the virus and speed­ily re­store life and econ­omy to nor­malcy. We have ev­ery con­fi­dence to achieve our goals within the set time frame, that is, to fin­ish the build­ing of a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects, lift out of poverty all ru­ral res­i­dents liv­ing be­low the cur­rent poverty line, and meet ten years ahead of sched­ule the poverty erad­i­ca­tion tar­get set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. China is the largest de­vel­op­ing coun­try in the world, a coun­try that is com­mit­ted to peace­ful, open, co­op­er­a­tive and com­mon de­vel­op­ment. We will never seek hege­mony, ex­pan­sion, or sphere of in­flu­ence. We have no in­ten­tion to fight ei­ther a Cold War or a hot war with any coun­try. We will con­tinue to nar­row dif­fer­ences and re­solve dis­putes with oth­ers through di­a­logue and ne­go­ti­a­tion. We do not seek to de­velop only our­selves or en­gage in a zero-sum game. We will not pur­sue de­vel­op­ment be­hind closed doors. Rather, we aim to fos­ter, over time, a new de­vel­op­ment par­a­digm with do­mes­tic cir­cu­la­tion as the main­stay and do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional cir­cu­la­tions re­in­forc­ing each other. This will cre­ate more space for China’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and add im­pe­tus to global eco­nomic re­cov­ery and growth. China will con­tinue to work as a builder of global peace, a con­trib­u­tor to global de­vel­op­ment and a de­fender of in­ter­na­tional or­der. To sup­port the UN in play­ing its cen­tral role in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs, I hereby an­nounce the fol­low­ing steps to be taken by China: ◆ China will pro­vide another US$50 mil­lion to the UN Covid-19 Global Hu­man­i­tar­ian Re­sponse Plan. ◆ China will pro­vide US$50 mil­lion to the China-FAO South-South Co­op­er­a­tion Trust Fund (Phase III). ◆ China will ex­tend the Peace and De­vel­op­ment Trust Fund be­tween the UN and China by five years af­ter it ex­pires in 2025. ◆ China will set up a UN Global Geospa­tial Knowl­edge and In­no­va­tion Cen­tre and an In­ter­na­tional Re­search Cen­tre of Big Data for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals to fa­cil­i­tate the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. Mr Pres­i­dent, col­leagues, the ba­ton of his­tory has been passed to our gen­er­a­tion, and we must make the right choice, a choice wor­thy of the peo­ple’s trust and of our times. Let us join hands to up­hold the val­ues of peace, de­vel­op­ment, eq­uity, jus­tice, democ­racy and free­dom shared by all of us and build a new type of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and a com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture for mankind. To­gether, we can make the world a bet­ter place for ev­ery­one.",津巴布韦

The Chi­nese-lan­guage com­men­tary, which was pub­lished un­der the by­line “Xuanyan” in the Peo­ple’s Daily, sum­marised China’s achieve­ments in re­form and open­ing up. Four decades of re­form and open­ing up have brought “epic progress” to an old coun­try, said the ar­ti­cle.

What China has achieved en­abled the world to de­velop “a whole new un­der­stand­ing of so­cial­ism” and proved that the West­ern model of mod­erni­sa­tion is not the sole pat­tern but only one of many choices, it com­mented. The Com­mu­nist Party of China has “launched a great rev­o­lu­tion, the most pro­found in the Chi­nese his­tory, by com­bin­ing sci­en­tific truth and China’s re­al­ity”, it said. Con­tem­po­rary China has opened its doors and fully in­volved it­self in eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion, while em­brac­ing the tide of re­form and in­no­va­tion, ac­cord­ing to the ar­ti­cle. It went on to say that as so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics has en­tered a new era, “there are moun­tains to climb and treach­er­ous waters to wade across”.",津巴布韦

Huang Kun­ming, ex­ec­u­tive vice min­is­ter of the Pub­lic­ity De­part­ment of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, which hosted the sem­i­nar, said BRICS coun­tries are in sim­i­lar stages of de­vel­op­ment, con­fronted by sim­i­lar chal­lenges. Shar­ing ex­pe­ri­ence on gov­er­nance will help par­tic­i­pants learn from one an­other and im­prove de­vel­op­ment. BRICS mem­bers ac­count for about 23 per­cent of the world econ­omy. They jointly con­trib­uted more than half of global growth in 2016. The group­ing, based nei­ther on ide­ol­ogy nor geopol­i­tics, is seen as a new and per­haps bet­ter form of global gov­er­nance in which emerg­ing mar­kets play key roles. But in re­cent years, BRICS mem­bers and other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries have en­coun­tered dif­fi­cul­ties and set­backs. China, though its eco­nomic growth has slowed, re­mains sta­ble and re­silient as it moves to­ward a “mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety” by 2020. Pek­ing Univer­sity pro­fes­sor and for­mer World Bank chief economist Justin Lin Yifu said that among nearly 200 de­vel­op­ing economies af­ter WWII, only two have tran­si­tioned from low-in­come to high-in­come economies. China may be­come the third by 2025. Shar­ing the find­ings of his lat­est study, Lin said the main rea­son de­vel­op­ing economies re­mained trapped in mid­dle-in­come or low-in­come sta­tus was that most of them fol­lowed West­ern main­stream eco­nomic the­o­ries, ei­ther struc­tural­ism or ne­olib­er­al­ism, and failed to main­tain a bal­ance be­tween the mar­ket and the state. Struc­tural­ism ad­vo­cates ex­ces­sive in­ter­ven­tion, while ne­olib­er­al­ism cham­pi­ons “lais­sez faire,” he said. “The se­cret of China’s suc­cess is its use of both ‘in­vis­i­ble hand’ and ‘vis­i­ble hand,’” Lin said. Only when the mar­ket and the state play their re­spec­tive roles can tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion and in­dus­trial up­grad­ing pro­ceed smoothly, he said. Robert Kuhn, a China ex­pert from the United States, ex­pounded on how Chinese de­ci­sion mak­ers used the “Four Com­pre­hen­sives” as an over­ar­ch­ing frame­work and strate­gic blue­print to reach de­vel­op­ment goals. The “Four Com­pre­hen­sives” en­com­pass ef­forts to pur­sue a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety, re­form, rule of law and Party dis­ci­pline. Kuhn has penned many books on Chinese gov­er­nance, the lat­est be­ing “How China’s Lead­ers Think.” He said for­eign­ers who dis­miss these po­lit­i­cal apho­risms as sim­plis­tic slo­ga­neer­ing miss an op­por­tu­nity to en­rich their un­der­stand­ing of the re­al­i­ties of China and of gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence that has broader ap­pli­ca­bil­ity in the world. Di­rec­tor of the China-Brazil Cen­tre for Re­search and Busi­ness Ron­nie Lins said China’s de­vel­op­ment model could serve as a bench­mark for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Es­sop Goolam Pa­had, the ed­i­tor of South Africa’s Thinker Mag­a­zine, said China’s ex­pe­ri­ence in fight­ing poverty, for ex­am­ple, of­fers crit­i­cal lessons for Africa. China has lifted 700 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty over the past 30 years and aims now to end poverty by 2020. Pa­had, who once served as Min­is­ter in the South African Presidency, said poverty per­sists in many African coun­tries. Close to 400 mil­lion Africans sur­vive on less than $1.25 a day. Pa­had said one Chinese les­son he learned was that the bat­tle must be­gin by ad­dress­ing the mind­set of com­mu­ni­ties and their lead­ers: they must be­lieve that de­vel­op­ment is pos­si­ble, what­ever the odds. “The weak hatch­ling will never take off if it de­pends on gov­ern­ment aid, fi­nan­cial grants, and wel­fare al­lowances,” he said. While high­light­ing China’s suc­cess, most par­tic­i­pants at the sem­i­nar also agreed that there is no one-size-fit­sall de­vel­op­ment model to be copied. — Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201126,More op­por­tu­ni­ties ahead for China-Zim co­op­er­a­tion,"BNDS1), ACK in China, from Oc­to­ber 26 to 29, the fifth ple­nary session of the 19th Cen­tral Com­mit­tee of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) was held in Bei­jing. The session adopted CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee’s pro­pos­als for the for­mu­la­tion of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for Na­tional Eco­nomic and So­cial Devel­op­ment and the Long-Range Ob­jec­tives Through the Year 2035. Party plenums are for­mal meet­ings of the Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, the high­est level “congress,” as it were, of the rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party of China, at­tended by more than 300 full and al­ter­nate mem­bers. The fifth plenum marks an in­flec­tion point be­tween China’s two cen­te­nary goals: the first, the mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety, achieved this year, 2020, high­lighted by the elim­i­na­tion of all ex­treme poverty; the jour­ney to­wards the sec­ond, fully build­ing a mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try, will be­gin in 2021. Both China and Zim­babwe have come to a new starting point in devel­op­ment. What are the mes­sages from the mile­stone meet­ing in Bei­jing? What new op­por­tu­ni­ties can we ex­pect to fur­ther grow China-Zim­babwe co­op­er­a­tion? The past five years Drawn up ev­ery five years since 1953, the FYP is a ma­jor fea­ture of China’s gov­er­nance sys­tem, set­ting growth tar­gets and defin­ing eco­nomic and so­cial devel­op­ment poli­cies to en­sure na­tional strate­gies keep pace with the times. Dur­ing the 13th FYP pe­riod, which is com­ing to an end in 2020, China has made great progress: its GDP is ex­pected to sur­pass the 100 tril­lion yuan (US$14,9 tril­lion) mark in 2020; more than 55 mil­lion peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty; it has built the world’s largest so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem; its ba­sic med­i­cal in­sur­ance cov­ers over 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple; its ba­sic old-age in­sur­ance cov­ers nearly 1 bil­lion peo­ple; more than 60 mil­lion new jobs were cre­ated in the ur­ban ar­eas. The next five years In the 14th FYP, the first key­word is “dual-cir­cu­la­tion.” China will make poli­cies to un­leash the full po­ten­tial of the do­mes­tic mar­ket, en­cour­ag­ing com­pa­nies to pro­vide higher- qual­ity goods and ser­vices to bet­ter stim­u­late do­mes­tic de­mand. China will give greater ac­cess to for­eign in­vestors and en­cour­age Chi­nese com­pa­nies to trade more with the out­side world. This round of open­ing-up will be “on a greater scale, across more sec­tors and on a deeper level”. The sec­ond key word is “in­no­va­tion,” which is men­tioned 47 times in the draft pro­posal. The new plan re­ally puts in­no­va­tion at the heart of China’s fu­ture plans. China will strive to make ma­jor break­throughs in core tech­nolo­gies in key ar­eas and be­come a global leader in in­no­va­tion. Many pre­dict there will be in­creased in­put in the com­ing years in emerg­ing sec­tors, such as biotech­nol­ogy, semi­con­duc­tors and new en­ergy ve­hi­cles. An­other area of fo­cus is green growth. In the draft pro­posal, there are no rigid GDP tar­gets; “green growth” is the new buzz­word. China will al­lo­cate en­ergy and re­sources more ap­pro­pri­ately and raise util­i­sa­tion ef­fi­ciency. It will con­tinue re­duc­ing emis­sions of ma­jor pol­lu­tants and im­prov­ing eco­log­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, make eco­log­i­cal se­cu­rity shields more solid, and greatly im­prove ur­ban and ru­ral liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment. All these key­words point to China’s fo­cus on high-qual­ity devel­op­ment. In 2021, China will en­ter a new devel­op­ment stage and em­bark on a new jour­ney of build­ing a mod­ern so­cial­ist coun­try in all as­pects. In this new stage, to pro­mote high-qual­ity devel­op­ment. Un­til 2035 This year, for the first time since 1953, a 15-year “long-term vi­sion” is men­tioned along with a new FYP, aim­ing for 2035 when the coun­try’s so­cial­ist mod­ern­iza­tion is ex­pected to be ba­si­cally achieved. It pre­dicts a vi­brant econ­omy, ro­bust tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pac­ity, and com­pre­hen­sive na­tional strength. An ar­ray of goals were set for 2035: China’s eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal strength, and com­pos­ite na­tional strength will in­crease sig­nif­i­cantly. A new stride will be made in the growth of the econ­omy and the per capita in­come of ur­ban and ru­ral res­i­dents. Mak­ing ma­jor break­throughs in core tech­nolo­gies in key ar­eas, China will be­come a global leader in in­no­va­tion. New in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, IT ap­pli­ca­tion, ur­ban­i­sa­tion, and agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion will be ba­si­cally achieved. China will fin­ish build­ing a mod­ernised econ­omy; The mod­erni­sa­tion of China’s sys­tem and ca­pac­ity for gov­er­nance will be ba­si­cally achieved. The peo­ple’s rights to par­tic­i­pate and to de­velop as equals will be ad­e­quately pro­tected. The rule of law for the coun­try, the gov­ern­ment, and so­ci­ety will be ba­si­cally in place. China will be­come a strong coun­try in cul­ture, ed­u­ca­tion, tal­ent, sports and health. The well-rounded devel­op­ment of all peo­ple and so­cial eti­quette and ci­vil­ity will be sig­nif­i­cantly en­hanced. China’s cul­tural soft power will grow much stronger. Eco-friendly ways of work and life will be ad­vanced to cover all ar­eas of so­ci­ety. Car­bon emis­sion will steadily de­cline after reach­ing a peak, and there will be a fun­da­men­tal im­prove­ment in the en­vi­ron­ment with the goal of build­ing a Beau­ti­ful China ba­si­cally reached; The open­ing-up will reach a new stage with sub­stan­tial growth of the coun­try’s strengths for par­tic­i­pat­ing in in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and com­pe­ti­tion. The per capita GDP will reach the level of mod­er­ately de­vel­oped coun­tries. The size of the middle-in­come group will be sig­nif­i­cantly ex­panded. Eq­ui­table ac­cess to ba­sic pub­lic ser­vices will be en­sured. Dis­par­i­ties in ur­ban-ru­ral devel­op­ment, in devel­op­ment be­tween re­gions, and in liv­ing stan­dards will be sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced. The im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Peace­ful China ini­tia­tive will be pro­moted to a higher level. The mod­erni­sa­tion of na­tional de­fence and the mil­i­tary will be ba­si­cally achieved. Peo­ple will lead a bet­ter life, and more no­table and sub­stan­tial progress will be achieved in pro­mot­ing well- rounded hu­man devel­op­ment and achiev­ing com­mon pros­per­ity for ev­ery­one. The plug-in for Zim­babwe Promis­ing to de­liver broad-based trans­for­ma­tion, new wealth cre­ation and ex­pand hori­zons of eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties for all Zim­bab­weans, Zim­babwe’s NDS1 aims to strengthen macroe­co­nomic sta­bil­ity, strengthen so­cial in­fra­struc­ture and so­cial safety nets, en­sure sus­tain­able en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and re­silience, pro­mote good gov­er­nance, mod­ernise the econ­omy through use of ICT and dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, among a num­ber of other pri­or­ity tar­gets. Even with only a cur­sory glance, one will see the sim­i­lar philoso­phies and pri­or­i­ties in the Chi­nese and Zim­bab­wean strate­gies. For ex­am­ple, both are com­mit­ted to mak­ing devel­op­ment in­clu­sive, en­vi­ron­ment-friendly, peo­ple-cen­tred, and in­no­va­tion-driven. Go­ing for­ward, there are two lev­els - bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral - on which China and Zim­babwe can en­gage each other for more op­por­tu­ni­ties. Bi­lat­er­ally, there is a lot to do in agri­cul­ture, manufacturing, in­no­va­tion, and de­vel­op­ing a dig­i­tal econ­omy. Other ar­eas such as en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, and cul­ture also look highly promis­ing. On the mul­ti­lat­eral level, the real deal is in the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC), which is go­ing to be­gin its third decade next year. China’s 14th FYP and the 2035 Vi­sion res­onate well with the ar­eas of China and Africa have been work­ing on un­der FOCAC. China’s re­newed mo­men­tum in these ar­eas will put FOCAC on an even stronger foot­ing. For decades, China and Zim­babwe have been march­ing side by side, lib­er­at­ing our peo­ples from for­eign in­vaders, build­ing a strong and in­de­pen­dent nation, and pro­mot­ing democ­racy and jus­tice in the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Our time-tested friend­ship will em­brace an even more promis­ing fu­ture as we em­bark on a new jour­ney in 2021.

zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20210108,"World econ­omy in 2021: Who’s likely to win, lose","THE coron­avirus has crip­pled the world econ­omy. Global GDP suf­fered its sharpest drop since the end of the sec­ond world war in 2020, mil­lions were un­em­ployed or fur­loughed, and gov­ern­ments pumped tril­lions of dol­lars into their economies to pre­vent greater dam­age. Nev­er­the­less, a 2021 re­cov­ery is very un­cer­tain. China’s econ­omy is grow­ing strongly again, but many of the world’s rich­est na­tions may not fully re­bound un­til 2022 at the ear­li­est. In­equal­ity is also ram­pant. While Amer­ica’s 651 bil­lion­aires have in­creased their net worth by 30 per­cent to US$4 tril­lion, a quar­ter of a bil­lion peo­ple in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries could face ab­so­lute poverty, and up to half the global work­force may have lost their liveli­hoods. Ad­van­tage Asia The speed at which the pan­demic can be con­tained will have a huge bear­ing on how the world econ­omy per­forms. In the race between new vir­u­lent strains of the virus and the vac­cine roll-out, early vic­tory is by no means as­sured. Even rich coun­tries that have se­cured most of the avail­able vac­cines may fail to in­oc­u­late enough peo­ple to pro­vide herd im­mu­nity un­til the end of 2021. In de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, where vac­cines will gen­er­ally be scarce, the virus is ex­pected to spread fur­ther. The big win­ners are likely to be coun­tries like China and South Korea that suc­ceeded in sup­press­ing COVID-19 early. China’s econ­omy is pro­jected to grow in 2021 by 8 per­cent, over twice that of the most suc­cess­ful western coun­tries even be­fore the pan­demic. China’s ex­port-led econ­omy has ac­tu­ally ben­e­fited from lockdowns in western coun­tries. Western de­mand for ser­vices like en­ter­tain­ment and travel may have de­clined, but de­mand for house­hold con­sumer goods and med­i­cal sup­plies has in­creased. Chi­nese ex­ports to the US have reached record lev­els de­spite the high tar­iffs im­posed by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. China is ex­pand­ing its eco­nomic in­flu­ence through­out Asia, with a new free trade area in the Pa­cific and huge in­fra­struc­ture projects along its trade routes to Europe and Africa. It is in­vest­ing in ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies to re­duce its de­pen­dence on western sup­ply chains for com­po­nents such as semi­con­duc­tors. China could now over­take the US as the world’s largest econ­omy within five years, twice as fast as pre­vi­ously pre­dicted. Harder times else­where For rich coun­tries such as the US, UK and those in main­land Europe, the pic­ture is less rosy. Af­ter brief re­cov­er­ies in sum­mer 2020, their economies stag­nated. This was driven as much by the sec­ond wave of the pan­demic as lockdowns. In the US, for in­stance, em­ploy­ment and growth closely tracked the pan­demic rather than the un­evenly ap­plied lockdowns as busi­ness and con­sumer con­fi­dence slumped. Even with some re­cov­ery next year, th­ese economies are ex­pected to be 5 per­cent smaller in 2022 than if the cri­sis had not oc­curred. The big­gest losers of 2021, how­ever, are likely to be de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. They lack both the eco­nomic re­sources to ac­quire enough vac­cines, and the public health sys­tems to treat large num­bers of Covid-19 pa­tients. They also can’t af­ford the huge gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies that have pre­vented mass un­em­ploy­ment in Europe and the US. With de­mand for their raw ma­te­ri­als crip­pled by the re­ces­sion in the west, and lit­tle aid avail­able from rich coun­tries to al­le­vi­ate their large debts, they can ill af­ford fur­ther lockdowns. Even formerly fast-grow­ing coun­tries like Brazil and In­dia are fac­ing hard times. Many mil­lions of poor work­ers in the in­for­mal sec­tor are be­ing forced back to their vil­lages and ur­ban slums to face mass poverty and even star­va­tion. Mean­while South Africa, the wealth­i­est coun­try in Africa, may have left it too late to ob­tain enough vac­cines to stem the rapid rise in in­fec­tions. It has taken a col­lec­tive ap­proach by be­com­ing a mem­ber of the COVAX pro­gramme. The pro­gramme aims to en­sure that poorer coun­tries do not lose out, but it has yet to achieve re­sults. The new di­vide The eco­nomic ef­fects of the pan­demic have been hugely var­ied across so­ci­ety. Those in full­time work, of­ten in highly paid jobs work­ing from home, have ac­cu­mu­lated sub­stan­tial sav­ings since there is less to spend wages on. The very rich, es­pe­cially in the US, have ben­e­fited from huge stock mar­ket in­creases driven by pan­demic suc­cesses like Ama­zon, Net­flix and Zoom — and this looks likely to con­tinue. The big ques­tion for the econ­omy is whether in the com­ing year those with se­cure jobs and high in­comes will re­turn to their pre­vi­ous spend­ing pat­terns, or hold on to their sav­ings in the face of con­tin­u­ing un­cer­tainty. In con­trast, many who have lost jobs or busi­nesses or been fur­loughed will strug­gle to find new work or re­turn to their pre­vi­ous in­come lev­els — es­pe­cially since low-wage sec­tors such as re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity are un­likely to re­cover fully af­ter the pan­demic. This group in­cludes many younger peo­ple, women and eth­nic mi­nori­ties. The in­equal­ity could be in­creased as rich gov­ern­ments scale back the huge sub­si­dies be­ing used to keep many work­ers em­ployed or fur­loughed. Rishi Su­nak, the UK chan­cel­lor, gave clear in­di­ca­tions of this in­ten­tion in his Novem­ber spend­ing re­view. In the US, the po­lit­i­cal dead­lock over fur­ther re­lief spend­ing was only re­solved at the last minute, and Repub­li­cans will prob­a­bly now aim to min­imise Bi­den-ad­min­is­tra­tion spend­ing de­spite the profli­gacy of the Trump years. Europe has just reached an un­prece­dented agree­ment to pro­vide EU-funded aid to mem­ber states most af­fected by the pan­demic, but ten­sions over the ex­tent of the pack­age and the re­cip­i­ents will prob­a­bly con­tinue. — The Con­ver­sa­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200907,For­eign aid game is chang­ing,"THERE are grow­ing signs that the aid re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Global South and the Global North is chang­ing fast. Many tra­di­tional Western donors are re-eval­u­at­ing the role of aid while keep­ing a close eye on their own na­tional in­ter­ests. These changes may not be all bad. Since the turn of the cen­tury, aid poli­cies have be­come both com­plex and frag­mented. Four ma­jor in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment poli­cies and goal set­ting projects were launched in 2015 alone. These are the Paris Agree­ment, the Ad­dis Ababa Ac­tion Agenda on Fi­nanc­ing for De­vel­op­ment, the Sendai Frame­work for Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion and the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. The global de­vel­op­ment agenda now in­cludes mul­ti­ple goals on poverty re­duc­tion, eco­nomic growth, the en­vi­ron­ment and cli­mate change. This un­prece­dented in­ter­na­tional pol­icy over­load is rad­i­cally al­ter­ing the aid landscape. As the world’s most de­vel­oped coun­tries craft a new nar­ra­tive that more strongly links aid to cli­mate change and hu­man­i­tar­ian crises, African coun­tries can tip the bal­ance in their favour. This can pro­vide an op­por­tu­nity to shape the fu­ture of North-South re­la­tions. Less talk of rich-poor coun­try There has been less talk of the rich-poor di­chotomy since the in­tro­duc­tion of the am­bi­tious Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) in 2015. In­deed, the de­vel­op­ment goals have strength­ened the nar­ra­tive that the re­spon­si­bil­ity for achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment ap­plies to all coun­tries. Al­though each coun­try may face dis­tinct chal­lenges, the in­ter-con­nect­ed­ness of global progress means that we are all in the same boat. Many African coun­tries have en­gaged in South-South co­op­er­a­tion with ma­jor pow­ers like China and In­dia. In build­ing large in­fra­struc­ture projects, China high­lights its im­pres­sive achieve­ments in lift­ing over half a bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty. In­dia show­cases the suc­cesses of its green revo­lu­tion and ad­vances in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy and af­ford­able health­care. Both coun­tries also flaunt their abil­ity to de­velop af­ford­able, avail­able, and adapt­able tech­nol­ogy and their es­tab­lished track record of solv­ing de­vel­op­men­tal chal­lenges. With the grow­ing global eco­nomic power and in­flu­ence of China, In­dia and other mid­dle-in­come coun­tries, de­vel­op­ment diplo­macy is be­ing re­con­sti­tuted. A ‘new page’ The UK has of­ten in the past shown a soft spot for its for­mer colonies and been hailed as a gen­er­ous and in­no­va­tive global leader. But it is now also openly tout­ing the na­tional in­ter­est. The UK-Africa Sum­mit held in Jan­uary 2020 was an at­tempt to ad­vance new ini­tia­tives and com­mer­cial part­ner­ships with the con­ti­nent. And there is con­sid­er­able un­cer­tainty on the ex­tent to which Nordic gen­eros­ity of ty­ing aid with “soft power” is com­pat­i­ble with main­tain­ing a well-funded wel­fare state and achiev­ing pol­icy co­her­ence on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The cli­mate cri­sis has made it abun­dantly clear that the oil pro­duc­ing and gen­er­ous aid providers like Norway can­not “lead” the global de­vel­op­ment agenda with­out un­der­tak­ing bold ini­tia­tives at home. It is not just the West, but also other ac­tors that are show­ing in­ter­est in Africa. Rus­sia has launched a ma­jor strat­egy to open “a new page” and make the whole con­ti­nent a for­eign pol­icy pri­or­ity. Africa is thus at­tract­ing re­newed global in­ter­est and ri­valry among world pow­ers. Some even warn of a “new scram­ble for Africa” in­volv­ing ma­jor and emerg­ing pow­ers who are all vy­ing for the con­ti­nent’s at­ten­tion. Al­though aid flows may de­crease over time, there is now more in­ter­est in boost­ing trade and in­vest­ments. The key ques­tion for us is how African coun­tries can use this grow­ing in­ter­est to their ad­van­tage. Three ma­jor chal­lenges We iden­tify three broad sets of con­cerns as African states be­come en­tan­gled in new and re­ju­ve­nated re­la­tion­ships with ma­jor world pow­ers. The first re­lates to fears of ris­ing debt. In­ter­na­tional schol­ars and or­gan­i­sa­tions have ar­gued that a re­newed com­mit­ment to debt re­lief should be a top pri­or­ity for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Con­ces­sional loans and for­eign ex­per­tise have been used to build ex­pen­sive in­fra­struc­ture projects that African coun­tries can­not af­ford. Re­cent po­lit­i­cal de­bates in Zam­bia and Nige­ria il­lus­trate the grow­ing con­cern over re­pay­ing debts to China. There are also con­cerns over the en­vi­ron­men­tal and fi­nan­cial costs of Rus­sian ac­tiv­i­ties on the con­ti­nent. The will­ing­ness of Western pow­ers to pro­vide debt re­lief is also un­der ques­tion. The sec­ond re­lates to the in­creas­ingly tense US-China re­la­tions. An il­lus­tra­tive ex­am­ple is the feud be­tween Rus­sia and China on the one hand and the African group of 3 within the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. While the three — Côte d’Ivoire, Equa­to­rial Guinea and South Africa — sought a strong coun­cil back­ing for civil­ian rule fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir’s ouster in April 2019, the two per­ma­nent mem­bers de­murred. Kenya has shown that it can take a tough stance against both the US and China. It re­cently re­buffed US ef­forts to boy­cott Huawei and high­lighted the poor qual­ity of med­i­cal equip­ment it had im­ported from China. A third area of con­cern is greater un­cer­tainty on the ben­e­fits of con­tin­ued glob­al­i­sa­tion. The po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in the US and parts of Europe has strength­ened the voice of those ar­gu­ing for the pri­macy of the na­tional in­ter­est in po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion mak­ing. One ev­i­dent re­sult has been the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­duced sup­port for mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions. An­other is the 20 per­cent cut in the UK’s aid bud­get. The wave of refugees into Europe in 2015 also con­trib­uted to an in­ward-look­ing men­tal­ity in many coun­tries. The re­sult was a re­al­lo­ca­tion of aid bud­gets to cover in-donor costs of hous­ing refugees. There was also more ex­plicit align­ment of aid with na­tional in­ter­ests such as com­mer­cial and se­cu­rity con­cerns. How African lead­ers ad­dress these three over­ar­ch­ing sets of con­cerns will greatly de­ter­mine the fu­ture avail­abil­ity of de­vel­op­ment fi­nance on the con­ti­nent. Rene­go­ti­ate the terms A more ex­plicit em­pha­sis on the na­tional in­ter­est may en­cour­age donor coun­tries to play “the long game” in Africa. Am­bi­tious for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties and in­no­va­tive de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes may even achieve cross-po­lit­i­cal sup­port from tax­pay­ers in parts of Europe where aid pol­icy is con­tentious. But in­creased em­pha­sis on the na­tional in­ter­est also ex­poses the seem­ingly al­tru­is­tic “donor-re­cip­i­ent” re­la­tion­ship. Court­ing closer ties with Africa will not sim­ply be about bring­ing gifts, but also ex­pect­ing rec­i­proc­ity in some form. But Western cri­tiques of Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will ring hol­low in the ab­sence of vi­able and state-led al­ter­na­tives from the West. His­tor­i­cally, many African states have had to ac­cept the pol­icy con­di­tion­al­ity of donor al­liances. There is now a unique op­por­tu­nity to de­mand what Africa needs. This is the mo­ment to play ex­ter­nal ac­tors off against each other. The con­ti­nent’s ma­jor economies must also take steps to en­able smaller coun­tries to be more as­sertive. With a di­verse field of com­pet­ing world pow­ers in­volved, and in as­sert­ing its own de­vel­op­ment vi­sion, African unity and co­or­di­na­tion is of ut­most im­por­tance. — The Con­ver­sa­tion Africa Dan Banik, is a pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence, di­rec­tor of the Oslo SDG Ini­tia­tive and host of “In Pur­suit of De­vel­op­ment” pod­cast at the Univer­sity of Oslo Niko­lai Hegertun, is a PhD stu­dent at the Cen­tre for De­vel­op­ment and the En­vi­ron­ment at the Univer­sity of Oslo",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20190314,Devo­lu­tion to spur Mat North growth: Min­is­ter,"MATA­BELE­LAND North Provin­cial Af­fairs Min­is­ter Richard Moyo yes­ter­day said devo­lu­tion of power will be a spring­board for eco­nomic growth in the re­source rich prov­ince. Mata­bele­land North is lag­ging be­hind in terms of devel­op­ment de­spite be­ing rich in nat­u­ral re­sources that in­clude coal, meth­ane gas, gold, tim­ber and has at­trac­tive tourist des­ti­na­tions Hwange Na­tional Park and the Vic­to­ria Falls. Cde Moyo, who is also Zanu-PF provin­cial chair­man, was among the party’s provin­cial chair­per­sons who re­cently vis­ited China to learn about how the coun­try trans­formed its econ­omy. He hailed the China trip as an eye opener for the party and Gov­ern­ment. Cde Moyo said China’s Com­mu­nist Party de­cided to grant au­ton­omy to the coun­try’s prov­inces lead­ing them to com­pete for devel­op­ment. He said the de­ci­sion by Zanu-PF un­der Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s ad­min­is­tra­tion to im­ple­ment devo­lu­tion would jump start provin­cial economies. “China im­ple­mented devo­lu­tion of power, which is what we are in the process of im­ple­ment­ing in the Sec­ond Re­pub­lic. Each dis­trict ad­min­is­tra­tor in the Re­pub­lic of China is in charge of their dis­trict, they do not need to con­sult every time they ini­ti­ate devel­op­ment projects. Min­is­ters of State run their prov­inces,” said Cde Moyo. “Prov­inces use lo­cal re­sources to de­velop the na­tional econ­omy. There is a prov­ince that spe­cialises in agri­cul­ture while an­other is premised on con­struc­tion. An­other is an in­dus­trial hub. What we ob­served is that all the prov­inces use their lo­cal re­sources for growth and devel­op­ment.” He said Mata­bele­land North has a lot to learn from China so that it can utilise lo­cally avail­able re­sources to fight poverty in the prov­ince. “In Mata­bele­land North we can se­ri­ously ben­e­fit from tourism, we have the Vic­to­ria Falls, we have tim­ber and we should have fur­ni­ture in­dus­tries. We have the largest de­posits of coal and we have gold as well as meth­ane gas. There­fore, once devo­lu­tion is rolled out, I’m con­fi­dent that our econ­omy will rise and con­trib­ute to devel­op­ment and na­tional growth. Poverty will be a thing of the past in the prov­ince,” Cde Moyo said. He said the prov­ince will hold a devo­lu­tion work­shop at Lu­pane State Univer­sity to­mor­row that will be ad­dressed by Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment, Pub­lic Works and Na­tional Hous­ing Min­is­ter Cde July Moyo. Cde Moyo said in China, the party’s provin­cial chair­per­sons also learnt of the supremacy of the party, say­ing it should not play sec­ond fid­dle to Gov­ern­ment. “What we learnt in China is that the party is big­ger than gov­ern­ment. The party should not wait for Gov­ern­ment to im­ple­ment poli­cies but should come up with poli­cies that will be im­ple­mented by Gov­ern­ment. We also learnt that China is a hard work­ing na­tion, peo­ple work day and night and that is why it is de­vel­oped the way it is,” he said.—@nqot­shili",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170119,Africa can take a leaf from China’s agric suc­cess story,"CHINA has struck the right chord by iden­ti­fy­ing agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment as pri­or­i­ties in its deal­ings with African coun­tries, and Zim­babwe in par­tic­u­lar. What is im­por­tant about these two sec­tors is that they have a po­ten­tial for a quick real­i­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent’s dream of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. It is im­por­tant that China has been ac­cel­er­at­ing in­vest­ments in Africa, es­pe­cially in these two key ar­eas. With lessons and ex­pe­ri­ences from how the Asian coun­try has man­aged to deal with poverty in a rel­a­tively short pe­riod, African coun­tries can also as­pire to turn around their sit­u­a­tions. What is needed for African coun­tries is to fo­cus their en­ergy on ar­eas that con­trib­ute to eco­nomic growth. China took a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion in 1978 that it could not con­tinue for long in the sit­u­a­tion it was in. That sit­u­a­tion was char­ac­terised by poverty and lack of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, the same state many African coun­tries find them­selves in to­day. The Chi­nese lead­ers, led by Pres­i­dent Deng Xiaop­ing, forged a new era of de­vel­op­ment, but still man­aged to main­tain the coun­try’s ma­jor char­ac­ter­is­tics of so­cial­ism. The mea­sures they put in, es­pe­cially in agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, led to the pros­per­ity that China is known for now. It was the re­form and open­ing up pol­icy that changed the face of China, as in­vestors flocked to the coun­try, bring­ing in the much needed cap­i­tal. What African coun­tries, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe, need to ap­pre­ci­ate at the mo­ment is that they do not pos­sess much cap­i­tal that can en­able them to quickly turn­around their sit­u­a­tions. Yet, the African of­fi­cials know ex­actly where that cap­i­tal re­sides and they know the means to at­tract it. What is needed is for the African coun­tries to gen­uinely ac­cept their sit­u­a­tion, like what China did in 1978, and de­vise ways of com­ing out of it. This in­cludes tak­ing lessons from how oth­ers did it. This is why China’s pri­or­i­ties on agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment in Africa be­come handy as an ex­pe­ri­ence that oth­ers can learn from. Not that African coun­tries should take what­ever comes from coun­tries like China “hook, line and sinker”. A big no and far from it. They must in­stead be able to as­sess their in­di­vid­ual sit­u­a­tions and go for only those as­pects of Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment that ap­ply to them and can re­late well to their am­bi­tions and goals. But it is im­por­tant that China re­alises that its ex­pe­ri­ences can be use­ful to other na­tions with the same de­vel­op­men­tal am­bi­tions as the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant. China did not be­come the sec­ond largest eco­nomic pow­er­house in the world by mis­take. It took a de­lib­er­ate ef­fort by its lead­ers who set clear goals and then the ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions to ex­e­cute those goals. So, when China ad­vo­cates for in­vest­ment in agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment in Africa, the Chi­nese lead­ers are speak­ing from a point of suc­cess­ful ex­pe­ri­ences. In re­cent years, the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant has been in­creas­ing its in­vest­ment in agri­cul­ture across the African con­ti­nent. China has much to of­fer to Africa con­sid­er­ing that its agri­cul­tural growth has been in­stru­men­tal in help­ing in the al­le­vi­a­tion of poverty. This makes the coun­try’s re­mark­able turn­around in agri­cul­ture of­fer many op­tions to African coun­tries, which still face the same prob­lems that China used to have. The ma­jor lesson be­ing that agri­cul­ture can con­trib­ute much to the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of a coun­try by pro­vid­ing raw ma­te­ri­als for the in­dus­tries. The sec­tor can help em­power the gen­er­al­ity of the peo­ple, es­pe­cially when the right mar­kets are avail­able and ac­ces­si­ble to the ma­jor­ity. A pro­gres­sive agri­cul­tural sec­tor can ac­tu­ally help fight poverty in the ru­ral ar­eas in Africa, where the ma­jor­ity live. The wide gap of poverty be­tween those who live in the ci­ties and those in the ru­ral ar­eas can ac­tu­ally be eas­ily nar­rowed if the agri­cul­tural sec­tor is vi­brant. So, agri­cul­tural in­vest­ment is im­por­tant for Africa, and China should be ap­plauded for re­al­is­ing that fact. Chi­nese fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions such as the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Bank, China Ex­port and Im­port Bank and the China De­vel­op­ment Bank have been in­volved in fund­ing the agri­cul­tural sec­tor in Africa. The China De­vel­op­ment Bank, for ex­am­ple, has fi­nanced an agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment deal be­tween Zim­babwe and China to the tune of $585 mil­lion in re­cent years. The Asian coun­try is also es­tab­lish­ing sev­eral agri­cul­tural de­mon­stra­tion cen­tres through­out the coun­try, where thou­sands of ex­perts will be trained. Sev­eral Zim­bab­wean agri­cul­tural of­fi­cials have been of­fered an op­por­tu­nity to study in China and en­hance their knowl­edge for use back home. Re­cently, Zim­babwe and the Chi­nese prov­ince of Jiangxi signed a Me­moran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing for the sup­ply of ir­ri­ga­tion and tillage equip­ment. There are so many other agri­cul­tural deals that have been clinched be­tween Zim­babwe and China. This shows that China un­der­stands bet­ter the de­vel­op­ment as­pi­ra­tions of African coun­tries and is will­ing to play a part in re­al­is­ing that dream. Agri­cul­ture ac­counts for about onethird of the African con­ti­nent’s Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to the African Union. Clearly, no de­vel­op­ment agenda can be im­ple­mented suc­cess­fully on the con­ti­nent with­out con­sid­er­ing a turn­around in agri­cul­ture. What is needed is to im­ple­ment mea­sures that will re­sult in high yields, and this can be achieved through ac­quir­ing new farm­ing tech­nolo­gies. This is why a tour made by Chi­nese am­bas­sador Mr Huang Ping and sev­eral gov­ern­ment min­is­ters at the China In­dus­trial In­ter­na­tional Group this week was im­por­tant. The group is in­volved in var­i­ous in­vest­ment projects in Zim­babwe, in­clud­ing agri­cul­ture. It emerged dur­ing the tour that Zim­babwe can do well by ex­plor­ing mar­kets for its agri­cul­tural prod­ucts in China. China is a vast mar­ket and a big con­sumer of agri­cul­tural pro­duce, with nearly 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple. This is def­i­nitely not a neg­li­gi­ble mar­ket. “We are ex­plor­ing Chi­nese mar­kets to be open for Zim­bab­wean agri­cul­ture prod­ucts, in­clu­sive of hor­ti­cul­ture, beef, poul­try and stock feeds,” said Fi­nance Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa dur­ing the tour. I want us to ex­plore, to­gether with the Chi­nese, I want to ex­plore the is­sue of China open­ing up its mar­kets to Zim­babwe’s agri­cul­tural pro­duce. When I say agri­cul­tural pro­duce I am talk­ing about beef, road­run­ners, chick­ens, flow­ers, hor­ti­cul­tural prod­ucts.” China is al­ready the big­gest buyer of to­bacco from Zim­babwe, with com­pa­nies like Tianze from the Asian coun­try in­volved in the grow­ing of the golden leaf. It has al­ready been proven that it is pos­si­ble for Chi­nese firms to part­ner with lo­cals in agri­cul­ture and pro­duce prod­ucts with a high qual­ity good enough for ex­port. So, the in­vest­ment from China should be di­rected to­wards im­prov­ing the agri­cul­tural in­fra­struc­ture to pro­duce more qual­ity goods. Dur­ing the tour, Mr Huang re­it­er­ated that the co­op­er­a­tion pri­or­i­ties in agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment were im­por­tant. “We are ready to start with agri­cul­ture,” he said. “We need to strengthen our co­op­er­a­tion in agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture. “I will bring more peo­ple from China. Lots of peo­ple have shown their in­ter­est in com­ing to in­vest here.” The China In­dus­trial In­ter­na­tional Group, for ex­am­ple, has al­ready pledged to in­vest $10 mil­lion to­wards hor­ti­cul­ture pro­duc­tion. This was after it re­cently ex­ported a sam­ple of flow­ers to China.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200604,Press­ing ques­tions about Africa and African coun­tries,"AFRICAN gov­ern­ments have been cheated for decades by Western coun­tries through the as­sis­tance given to them un­der the aus­pices of aid and loans. Tril­lions of US$ fund­ing have been poured into Africa, but the poverty on the con­ti­nent es­ca­lates still at un­prece­dented rates de­spite the amounts pro­vided. Why can't African gov­ern­ments see that they are be­ing robbed? Why should the ex­ploita­tion take so many years, but the ex­ploited still ac­cede to the ex­ploita­tion? Does Africa re­ally need such aid if it re­sults in fur­ther poverty for the con­ti­nent? Why does Africa re­ceive aid from other na­tions de­spite it be­ing en­dowed with more nat­u­ral re­sources than the coun­tries from which it re­ceives aid? Why do African gov­ern­ments bal­ance their bud­gets with aid from the de­vel­oped na­tions that have lesser nat­u­ral re­sources than African gov­ern­ments? Se­ri­ous in­tro­spec­tion by Africans and African lead­ers is long over­due. It is never a crime for one to ask one­self dif­fi­cult and even em­bar­rass­ing ques­tions some­times if one finds that one al­ways per­sis­tently meets with neg­a­tiv­ity and ret­ro­gres­sion all the way in one’s jour­ney in life. Africans and their African gov­ern­ments have al­ways had a one-sided ap­proach to­wards di­ag­nos­ing prob­lems for their fail­ures — re­crim­i­na­tion or blam­ing others. African gov­ern­ments have al­ways at­trib­uted their fail­ures to colo­nial­ism or sanc­tions whereas all such con­di­tions took place decades ago and could have eas­ily been averted and or could prompt them to strate­gise and come up with new ways of life. Un­for­tu­nate oc­cur­rences are a way of life to both in­di­vid­u­als and na­tions. Such oc­cur­rences will al­ways be­fall us. Once struck by an un­lucky sit­u­a­tion, one does not sit back and throw around his/ her hands in hope­less­ness and per­pet­u­ally sing the mis­for­tune as an ex­cuse. It is said that ne­ces­sity is the mother of in­ven­tion. Many coun­tries in his­tory have made dis­cov­er­ies as a re­sult of sanc­tions im­posed on them. Dur­ing the Sec­ond World War, Ger­many was sanc­tioned by the World War Al­lies not to re­ceive any su­gar from any­where in the world. In re­sponse, the Ger­mans made a dis­cov­ery of man­u­fac­tur­ing su­gar out of beet root. Dur­ing apartheid sanc­tions the then South African Boer gov­ern­ment em­barked on the man­u­fac­ture of fu­els from coal. It is folly for Africans to blame colo­nial­ism for all their poverty prob­lems be­cause all African coun­tries are now in­de­pen­dent. The last African coun­try to be in­de­pen­dent was South Africa, 26 years ago. It ap­pears that African gov­ern­ments have this “ex­cuse­mak­ing syn­drome”. They en­joy cry­ing foul to the detri­ment of de­vel­op­ing their coun­tries and peo­ples. Africa is the only con­ti­nent that has no car man­u­fac­turer de­spite the con­ti­nent hav­ing all the nec­es­sary raw ma­te­ri­als to man­u­fac­ture a car, al­lu­minium, iron, etc. etc. The best African coun­tries have man­aged to achieve to­wards that line is to have as­sem­bly points for for­ein car man­u­fac­tur­ers — Ja­panese and Ger­man cars. I am an African. It pains me to no­tice all these mal­adies about my peo­ple.The in­tro­spec­tive ques­tion to ask is: Could the school of thought that says that many Africans and many of their lead­ers are men­tally re­tarded be true? I know per­son­ally that I am not like that. What is the pur­pose of the African Union if it can­not mo­bilise all African lead­ers to the re­al­i­sa­tion of their wealth on nat­u­ral re­sources and talk ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and trad­ing within Africa through an African Union sim­i­lar to the Euro­pean Union? Why should in­di­vid­ual African coun­tries pre­fer trad­ing with China or Europe when there is an abun­dance of mar­kets within the con­ti­nent of Africa and among African coun­tries? I love my con­ti­nent! If we do not think for our­selves, no one will do it for us. Let's work to­gether as a con­ti­nent to up­lift our peo­ples. We can­not af­ford to be per­pet­ual eco­nomic un­der­dogs of other na­tions. It is costly to be de­pen­dent on others.

Hu­man devel­op­ment in­di­ca­tors, in­clud­ing life ex­pectancy, lit­er­acy, in­fant mor­tal­ity, per capita in­come, and the in­ci­dence of poverty, all show a dra­matic im­prove­ment, in line with the rapid eco­nomic growth. The Chi­nese called their re­form strat­egy “Gai Ge Kai Feng” — mean­ing “change the sys­tem, open the door.” “Change the sys­tem” en­tails al­ter­ing in­cen­tives and own­er­ship, that is, shift­ing the econ­omy from near to­tal own­er­ship to one in which pri­vate en­ter­prise is dom­i­nant. “Open the door” in­volves lib­er­al­is­ing trade and di­rect in­vest­ment. China’s rapid growth per­for­mance presents var­i­ous para­doxes that have be­come the sub­ject of heated de­bate within the eco­nomics pro­fes­sion. Why is it that a coun­try that es­pouses so­cial­ist prac­tice is among the fastest grow­ing coun­tries in the world, when vir­tu­ally all other so­cial­ist economies have col­lapsed? While there is lit­tle dis­agree­ment about the role of mar­ket re­forms in spurring China’s rapid growth, there is strong dis­pute about the char­ac­ter of those re­forms. Have they been grad­ual or rapid? Has the grad­u­al­ism been a source of suc­cess, or a hin­drance? Are the non-mar­ket as­pects of China’s econ­omy, such as the large state own­er­ship that per­sists till to­day, a source of po­ten­tial desta­bil­i­sa­tion in the years? What lessons, if any, does China’s ex­pe­ri­ence of­fer for other coun­tries in the tran­si­tion from cen­tral plan­ning to a mar­ket econ­omy? The first im­por­tant les­son to be learnt is that devel­op­ment is an en­doge­nous (in­ter­nal) process. No mat­ter the odds stacked against any coun­try whether in­ter­nally and/or ex­ter­nally in­duced any coun­try can de­velop. No coun­try or in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion has the re­spon­si­bil­ity or obli­ga­tion of de­vel­op­ing an­other coun­try. Devel­op­ment has to be ini­ti­ated and sus­tained in­ter­nally by the na­tion­als of that coun­try. No coun­try the world over has suc­cess­fully de­vel­oped with­out tak­ing a firm re­spon­si­bil­ity over its devel­op­ment course. China and the rest of the Asian tigers have de­vel­oped with­out a sin­gle cent from the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions (IFIs). They have suc­cess­fully lever­aged do­mes­tic re­sources to fund their own devel­op­ment. Eco­nomic his­tory is also lit­tered with coun­tries that have suc­cess­fully de­vel­oped in spite of sanc­tions. This is par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant for Zim­babwe where our po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship blames “West­ern-in­duced sanc­tions” for our lack of devel­op­ment. Coun­tries such as Cuba, South Africa, Iran, Rhode­sia, China and Rus­sia have suc­cess­fully im­ple- mented sanc­tions-bust­ing devel­op­ment strate­gies at some point in time dur­ing their devel­op­ment pro­cesses. Both China and the US were once colonised and yet they have sol­dered on to be­come the two big­gest eco­nomic su­per­pow­ers in the world right now. The sec­ond les­son is that what works in one coun­try may not nec­es­sar­ily work in an­other coun­try. Dif­fer­ent coun­tries have dif­fer­ent so­cial, eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural con­texts. Devel­op­ment is based on di­ag­nos­ing the key bind­ing con­straints af­fect­ing devel­op­ment in a coun­try and then deal­ing with those iden­ti­fied bind­ing con­straints in se­quen­tial, in­cre­men­tal and pro­gres­sive man­ner. Dif­fer­ent coun­tries have dif­fer­ent bind­ing con­straints. Hence, a one-size-fits-all devel­op­ment strat­egy is un­likely to work, what is needed is a dif­fer­ent-strokes-for-dif­fer­ent-folks ap­proach that takes into ac­count the idio­syn­cra­sies and par­tic­u­lar­i­ties of each coun­try. This ex­plains why Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­grammes (SAPs) have been a flop in many coun­tries. China’s econ­omy has been de­fined as a “so­cial mar­ket econ­omy” and does not fit into any one sys­tem. Rather, it takes var­i­ous parts of other sys­tems and com­bined them to cre­ate a sys­tem that best serves its na­tional in­ter­ests. Devel­op­ment is about de­fend­ing and pro­mot­ing your own na­tional in­ter­ests. In devel­op­ment there are no per­ma­nent friends but only per­ma­nent in­ter­ests. The third les­son is that for growth to be sus­tain­able it must be pro-poor and in­clu­sive. What this means is that it is not just the quan­tum of growth that mat­ters but more im­por­tantly the qual­ity of that growth. For a long time, growth in Africa though high, has been skewed. In fact, the UNDP has iden­ti­fied five ty­polo­gies of th­ese skewed growth pat­terns preva­lent in African economies namely: job­less growth; ruth­less growth; root­less growth; fu­ture­less growth and voice­less growth. In par­tic­u­lar, jobs are very im­por­tant for devel­op­ment as they pro­vide a use­ful link be­tween growth and devel­op­ment. More of­ten than not the only re­source that poor peo­ple have is their own labour and so jobs help to lift poor peo­ple out of the bondage of ex­treme poverty and de­pri­va­tion. Eco­nomic growth in China has been highly pro-poor for ex­am­ple be­tween 1981 and 2004 China went from more than two-thirds of the pop­u­la­tion living on less than US$1 to fewer than one per­son in 10 living in poverty. More than 500 mil­lion Chi­nese have been de­liv­ered from the de­mon of poverty be­tween 1981 and 2004. A cross-coun­try anal­y­sis of the growth im­pact of poverty com­par­ing China, In­dia and Brazil found that China’s eco­nomic growth re­duced poverty at a rate 50% higher than that of Brazil and much higher rel­a­tive to poverty re­duc­tion in In­dia. Sadly this has not been the case in Africa. In many African coun­tries while eco­nomic growth has in­creased poverty and in­equal­ity have also risen. The forth les­son is that while For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment (FDI) can play a pos­i­tive role in devel­op­ment as shown by China there is need to in­vest in the host coun­try fac­tors such in­fra­struc­ture, in­sti­tu­tions and fi­nan­cial devel­op­ment. Th­ese host coun­try fac­tors or ab­sorp­tive fac­tors help the host coun­tries to ef­fec­tively ab­sorb and ben­e­fit from the spillovers from FDI. In China, start­ing from 1978, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has in­vested heav­ily in both phys­i­cal and so­cial in­fra­struc­ture. They have also de­vel­oped strong in­sti­tu­tions. All th­ese fac­tors have helped the Chi­nese econ­omy to ab­sorb the spillovers and pos­i­tive ex­ter­nal­i­ties from FDI. This has not been the case in many African economies. In fact FDI in most African economies has helped to fuel en­clave economies. FDI in Africa has also wors­ened the cur­rent ac­count deficit through mas­sive profit repa­tri­a­tions as well as dis­plac­ing and crowd­ing out do­mes­tic in­vest­ment. So while FDI is very cru­cial we should in­vest in the lo­cal con­di­tions that al­low our economies to ab­sorb all the po­ten­tial benefits from FDI. An­other use­ful les­son from China is that State Owned En­ter­prises (SOEs) have the po­ten­tial to play a sig­nif­i­cant role in devel­op­ment. In China they have not gone for whole sale pri­vati­sa­tion like we have done in Africa. They have how­ever trans­formed their SOEs into au­ton­o­mous and profit-ori­ented in­sti­tu­tions with pro­mar­ket reg­u­la­tions and cor­po­rate gov­er­nance mech­a­nisms. As a re­sult more than 60 Chi­nese SOEs are in the For­tune Top 500 Global com­pa­nies in the world presently. As of 2014 SOEs in China con­trib­ute more than a third of fis­cal rev­enues. Un­for­tu­nately in many African coun­tries SOEs have been a ma­jor drain to the fis­cus. There is how­ever, scope and po­ten­tial for trans­form­ing and re­form­ing th­ese key in­sti­tu­tions into strong driv­ers of devel­op­ment in Africa. An­other im­por­tant les­son is that we should not de­spise small to medium en­ter­prises. In China the emer­gence of Town­ship and Vil­lage En­ter­prises which were nur­tured and sup­ported by the State also con­trib­uted sig­nif­i­cantly to devel­op­ment. Trade open­ness is also im­por­tant but it has to be done in a strate­gic and con­trolled man­ner. Whole­sale trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion will only re­sult in de-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. China only be­came a mem­ber of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in De­cem­ber 2001. Cap­i­tal ac­count lib­er­al­i­sa­tion also needs to be treated very cau­tiously. Coun­tries that have been hasty in lib­er­al­is­ing their cap­i­tal ac­counts com­pletely have been vul­ner­a­ble to fi­nan­cial shocks and cri­sis. Be­cause China has main­tained re­stric­tions on its cap­i­tal ac­count this has helped the Chi­nese econ­omy to weather the im­pact of the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis more suc­cess­fully than most de­vel­oped coun­tries. When the Chi­nese have de­cided what to do, they go all out to ac­com­plish it. This is a trait that African na­tions can learn from. One way of achiev­ing this is by im­prov­ing the qual­ity of our bu­reau­cracy. In China the gov­ern­ment not only re­cruits the top stu­dents from uni­ver­si­ties for public ser­vice but also of­fers aus­pi­cious and com­pet­i­tive salaries and work­ing con­di­tions to mo­ti­vate them to de­liver.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201022,"Ab­duc­tions, ar­rests will scare away in­vestors, Parly told","LO­CAL econ­o­mist Gift Mugano yes­ter­day chal­lenged government to stop ab­duc­tion and per­se­cu­tion of hu­man rights de­fend­ers and op­po­si­tion ac­tivists, say­ing the two vices were scar­ing away po­ten­tial in­vestors. Mugano, who is Africa Economic Devel­op­ment ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, told Par­lia­ment dur­ing a pre-bud­get sem­i­nar held in Harare yes­ter­day that government needed to ur­gently ad­dress its neg­a­tive per­cep­tion. He said Zim­babwe was fac­ing a multi-faceted economic cri­sis trig­gered by a huge ex­port bill av­er­ag­ing US$12,5 bil­lion ev­ery year be­cause the coun­try was not pro­duc­ing, but im­port­ing goods that should be man­u­fac­tured lo­cally. “The sec­ond prob­lem is the coun­try per­cep­tion, cen­tred on cor­rup­tion and ab­duc­tions — whether they are gen­uine or not — it is a neg­a­tive per­cep­tion and government must deal with those ar­rests of ac­tivists and whether they are jus­ti­fied or not, they must be re­solved be­cause the best way is to min­imise those is­sues,” Mugano said. He quashed Fi­nance min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube’s claims that there was a bud­get sur­plus, say­ing the US$75 COVID-19 al­lowances for civil ser­vants were not catered for in the bud­get, in­clud­ing the $18 bil­lion in­dus­trial stim­u­lus pack­age which is 29% of the 2020 bud­get of $63 bil­lion. “There was no pro­vi­sion in the 2020 bud­get for ad­just­ment of civil ser­vants’ salaries and yet they have gone up by 300% and that is mas­sive,” Mugano said. “You do not want to be a prophet in or­der to know that there is a bud­get deficit. There are sub­si­dies for fuel, elec­tric­ity and Zupco, which is a very big busi­ness and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund was very clear that government is run­ning a huge bud­get deficit.” He also said that it would make sense if the 2021 na­tional bud­get was an­nounced in United States dol­lars as the cur­rent cur­rency in­con­sis­ten­cies were not work­ing since the econ­omy had dol­larised. Government ad­viser and econ­o­mist Ashok Chakravarti said dol­lar­i­sa­tion had not been suc­cess­ful in any de­vel­op­ing coun­try, adding that the US dol­lar notes cir­cu­lat­ing in the coun­try were less than US$1 bil­lion. “It was a fake cre­ation. At the turn of 2020, we had about US$10 bil­lion which was cre­ated fic­ti­tiously. It was a Ponzi scheme and none of those US$ were real,” he said. “We said government should move in the di­rec­tion to say that, these are lo­cal cur­rency and deal with the mon­e­tary pol­icy is­sues.” Chakravarti said the in­ter­bank auc­tion ex­change sys­tem had brought a de­gree of sta­bil­ity on prices and the ex­change rate. Speaker of the Na­tional As­sem­bly Ja­cob Mu­denda said the world econ­omy was ex­pected to con­tract by 44%, ex­cept China whose econ­omy would grow by 4,9% de­spite COVID-19. He said Zim­babwe had the po­ten­tial to em­u­late China, which rose to be­come the world’s big­gest econ­omy within 45 years. Trade fi­nance spe­cial­ist Per­sis­tent Gwanyanya said the coun­try’s un­sus­tain­able debt lev­els caused cur­rency in­sta­bil­ity and high poverty lev­els, where twothirds of the Zim­bab­wean pop­u­la­tion was poor and 75% of ru­ral pop­u­la­tion was liv­ing in poverty.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180126,China to open econ­omy wider across the board,"DAVOS, Switzer­land. - Liu He, a se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cial, on Wed­nes­day elab­o­rated on the top-level plan­ning of China’s eco­nomic pol­icy for the next few years at the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) held in this Swiss re­sort. “In a nut­shell, this pol­icy cen­tres around a key ne­ces­sity, a main task and three crit­i­cal bat­tles,” said Liu, a mem­ber of the Po­lit­i­cal Bu­reau of the Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and direc­tor of the Gen­eral Of­fice of the Cen­tral Lead­ing Group for Fi­nan­cial and Eco­nomic Af­fairs. Liu also pledged that China will open wider to the world across the board. In his speech at the WEF, Liu stressed the ne­ces­sity to tran­sit the Chi­nese econ­omy from a phase of rapid growth to one of high-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment. “Our fo­cus needs to change from ‘Is there enough?’ to ‘Is it good enough?’,” he said. Such a tran­si­tion, he said, is the con­text in which China for­mu­lates its macroe­co­nomic, struc­tural, re­form and so­cial poli­cies in the com­ing years. “China’s per capita in­come is mov­ing up from the cur­rent level of 8 000-plus to US$10 000 and even higher. At such a stage of de­vel­op­ment, China needs to put more em­pha­sis on struc­tural im­prove­ment rather than quan­tity ex­pan­sion,” he said. As China opens up wider to the out­side world, this tran­si­tion to a new model of de­vel­op­ment will cre­ate huge op­por­tu­ni­ties for many new in­dus­tries. “It means op­por­tu­ni­ties for busi­nesses not just in China but across the world,” said the se­nior of­fi­cial. He also out­lined some of the tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits al­ready in place. To this point, China’s do­mes­tic de­mand has steadily ex­panded, with con­sump­tion con­tribut­ing 58,8 per­cent to eco­nomic growth, nearly four per­cent­age points higher than five years ago. The added value of the ser­vice sec­tor takes up 60 per­cent of GDP, more than five per­cent­age points higher than five years ago. The prin­ci­pal con­tra­dic­tion in China’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, Liu said, is the struc­tural mis­match re­sult­ing from the sup­ply side fail­ing to evolve in step with the de­mand. This as­pect of China’s eco­nomic pol­icy ur­gently needs to be fixed, he said. The pri­or­ity at the mo­ment, he em­pha­sised, is to cut ex­cess ca­pac­ity where nec­es­sary, re­duce in­ven­tory in the hous­ing sec­tor, bring down the over­all lever­age ratio, lower cost across the board, and strengthen the weak links in the econ­omy, rang­ing from public ser­vices to in­fra­struc­ture and in­sti­tu­tions. “With these mea­sures, we hope to make the sup­ply side more adapt­able and more in­no­va­tive. Some ini­tial progress has been made,” Liu said. Since 2016, China has cut over 115 mil­lion tons of steel ca­pac­ity, elim­i­nated an ad­di­tional 140 mil­lion tonnes of sub­stan­dard steel ca­pac­ity, and phased out over 500 mil­lion tonnes of coal ca­pac­ity. Though these mar­ket clear­ing mea­sures has led to price rises in some sec­tors, the to­tal fac­tor pro­duc­tiv­ity growth stopped its de­cline and be­gan to in­crease in 2016, Liu said. “The pos­i­tive spillover of our sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form is be­ing felt across the world. In­deed, this is a re­form that we must con­tinue and see through,” he added. Ac­cord­ing to Liu, China has to fight three crit­i­cal bat­tles in the next few years - risk preven­tion, poverty re­duc­tion and pol­lu­tion con­trol. “For China to build a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects, we must fix the short­est plank in our de­vel­op­ment through win­ning these bat­tles,” he said. First, al­though China’s fi­nan­cial sys­tem is ba­si­cally sound with a high sav­ings rate, China still needs to con­tinue pre­vent­ing and re­solv­ing ma­jor fi­nan­cial risks, Liu said. “Shadow bank­ing and hid­den debt for lo­cal gov­ern­ments are se­ri­ous prob­lems we have to deal with,” he spec­i­fied. Since the fourth quar­ter of 2017, China has had a marginally slower over­all lever­age ratio growth, which Liu said was a good sign. Sec­ond, China will con­tinue with smarter, more tar­geted ef­forts to lift more peo­ple out of poverty. “We have set a tar­get to ba­si­cally elim­i­nate ab­so­lute poverty in three years,” he said. In 2018 alone, China will lift 10 mil­lion peo­ple from ab­so­lute poverty, in­clud­ing 2,8 mil­lion who will be re­lo­cated from ar­eas suf­fer­ing from harsh con­di­tions. The third bat­tle is to fight pol­lu­tion con­tin­u­ously. “Green and low-car­bon de­vel­op­ment is what the Chi­nese peo­ple want the most in a break with the tra­di­tional growth model,” Liu said. China will ful­fil its pledges to counter cli­mate change and hon­our the Paris Agree­ment, he said. This year marks the 40th an­niver­sary of China’s re­form and open­ing-up drive, which is the very rea­son be­hind China’s ro­bust growth over the past four decades. China has to ad­vance re­form and open up at a faster pace, Liu said. China will fur­ther in­te­grate with in­ter­na­tional trade rules and ease mar­ket ac­cess. China will also sub­stan­tially open up the ser­vices sec­tor, the fi­nan­cial sec­tor in par­tic­u­lar, and cre­ate a more at­trac­tive in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment, he said. China’s vast do­mes­tic mar­ket, with a fast-grow­ing mid­dle-in­come pop­u­la­tion of 400 mil­lion, al­ready the world’s big­gest, will con­trib­ute sig­nif­i­cantly to global de­vel­op­ment, Liu said. The of­fi­cial also warned that deep-seated prob­lems in the world econ­omy have yet to be fixed, call­ing for con­certed global ef­forts. “Mul­ti­ple risks and con­sid­er­able un­cer­tain­ties come in the form of high debts, as­set bub­bles, pro­tec­tion­ism and the es­ca­la­tion of re­gional and in­ter­na­tional hotspots,” Liu added. Liu’s speech is part of the 400 fo­rums, dis­cus­sions and meet­ings dur­ing WEF 2018 that lasts from Jan­uary 23 to 26. Un­der the theme of “Cre­at­ing a Shared Fu­ture in a Frac­tured World”, this year’s fo­rum is bring­ing to­gether a record num­ber of heads of state, gov­ern­ment and in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions along­side lead­ers from busi­ness, civil so­ci­ety, and academia. - Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210219,New dawn for con­ti­nent as African steers world trade,"THE African con­ti­nent on Tues­day carved its own piece of his­tory when Nige­ria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was elected to lead the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, as its di­rec­tor-gen­eral. She be­comes the first woman and the first African to lead this 164- mem­ber or­gan­i­sa­tion in the 73 years of the Gen­eral Agree­ment on Tar­iffs and Trade (GATT), which later trans­formed to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion. A for­mer Nige­rian fi­nance min­is­ter and World Bank veteran, Okonjo-Iweala shrugged off stiff com­pe­ti­tion from seven other can­di­dates to lead the global trade body, which had gone for seven months with­out a leader. For strate­gic rea­sons, the ap­point­ment could not have come at a bet­ter time for Africa, a con­ti­nent that is hop­ing to con­sol­i­date its eco­nomic prow­ess, which is in­creas­ingly be­come too big to ig­nore fol­low­ing dra­matic and pos­i­tive eco­nomic strides in re­cent years. With an an­tic­i­pated eco­nomic boon fol­low­ing the op­er­a­tional­i­sa­tion of the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the con­ti­nent stands in a bet­ter po­si­tion to lobby for an in­crease in its world trade share be­cause it can now do so as one sin­gle unit and get a size­able share. Africa was not able to suc­cess­fully lobby for in­creased trade share be­fore be­cause of its frag­mented trad­ing poli­cies, that could not be syn­chro­nised into one for­mi­da­ble plat­form, hence the for­ma­tion of AfCFTA. Through AfCFTA and the pres­ence of an African leader at the WTO who un­der­stands the eco­nomic chal­lenges and prospects for growth of the con­ti­nent, the African Union (AU) can now suc­cess­fully lobby for an observer sta­tus at the WTO. The African Union only has an ad hoc observer sta­tus, which is re­viewed on a meet­ing- by- meet­ing ba­sis. Be­cause of its cur­rent sta­tus which only en­sures par­tial rep­re­sen­ta­tion at WTO meet­ings, the con­ti­nent has not been able to carry fully African eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tions as a unit, while rep­re­sent­ing the de­sires of mem­ber coun­tries. By not hav­ing a full observer sta­tus on such a pow­er­ful eco­nomic plat­form, Africa was nat­u­rally dis­ad­van­taged over its rel­a­tive lack of in­flu­ence over de­ci­sion-mak­ing com­pared with richer states. Con­trary to its man­date of pro­mot­ing trade be­tween na­tions, WTO has in­stead been fo­ment­ing dis­unity be­tween the poor and the rich. Over the years, WTO has failed dis­mally to re­duce the huge sub­si­dies paid to first world rich farm­ers, whose over­pro­duc­tion con­tin­ues to threaten the liveli­hoods of de­vel­op­ing world farm­ers, es­pe­cially in Africa. The WTO has also been un­able to pro­tect the poor in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries by al­low­ing gov­ern­ments to pro­duce cheap med­i­ca­tion be­cause of its fail­ure to clar­ify am­bi­gu­i­ties be­tween the need to pro­mote pub­lic health or pro­tect the in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights of big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies. Trade has also been in favour of rich na­tions. In some in­stances, African coun­tries were on sev­eral oc­ca­sions forced to elim­i­nate tar­iffs of up to 90 per­cent of their trade be­cause there are no clear rules ex­ist to pro­tect them. Okonjo-Iweala’s elec­tion should, there­fore, cur­tail over­fish­ing from the pow­er­ful na­tions and at least as­sist de­vel­op­ing na­tions to push their goods across by en­sur­ing that the WTO comes up with in­clu­sive trade re­forms that are mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial to all. Africa has a lot to ben­e­fit from the elec­tion of Okonjo-Iweala apart from an en­hanced diplo­matic pro­file and val­i­da­tion of African women’s com­pe­tency and lead­er­ship skills. The con­ti­nent should be­gin to see pos­i­tive trade reg­u­la­tions that al­low trad­ing on equal terms with­out ma­nip­u­la­tion of least de­vel­oped na­tions. WTO sets the rules for global trade and ad­ju­di­cates in trade dis­putes be­tween na­tions. It is also, ac­cord­ing to its web­site, sup­posed to open trade for the ben­e­fit of all. Avail­ing trad­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties on an open fo­rum will work in Africa’s favour be­cause the con­ti­nent has got abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, which it can use for poverty erad­i­ca­tion and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. From the long held nar­ra­tive that Africa is a hope­less con­ti­nent, the con­ti­nent is now an eco­nomic gi­ant that needs to spread its eco­nomic ten­ta­cles across the globe in search of big­ger and bet­ter economies for its peo­ple, than what is cur­rently hap­pen­ing. With its ef­forts in main­tain­ing peace and se­cu­rity, a youth­ful pop­u­la­tion and abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, Africa is emerg­ing as a new global cen­tre of eco­nomic growth that is in­creas­ingly sought af­ter by the world’s big­gest economies. Even the de­ci­sion by China to ini­ti­ate the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) was in­spired by Africa’s scale of eco­nomic im­pact and is clearly af­fir­ma­tion that the con­ti­nent has what it takes to be­come an eco­nomic gi­ant, once it has proper in­fras­truc­tural and struc­tural sup­port. How­ever, the struc­tural sup­port and in­sti­tu­tional re­forms have been hard to come by, es­pe­cially within the WTO, which has seen Africa’s share of world trade re­main at three per­cent over the years. That share of world trade s not re­flec­tive of the eco­nomic and trad­ing ac­tiv­i­ties hap­pen­ing through­out Africa. Africa al­ready has a po­si­tion on how it wants to trade with the rest of the world. Be­ing in pos­ses­sion of abun­dant re­sources does not mean that the con­ti­nent wants to con­tinue to be stripped off what it has. African mem­ber states feel that they stand to ben­e­fit more if they move away from ex­port­ing raw ma­te­ri­als and in­stead fo­cus on value ad­di­tion, es­pe­cially on their min­er­als. Be­fore she even walks into the of­fice, Okonjo- Iweala’s plate is al­ready full. With re­ports of a big slump in global trade as the ef­fects of Covid-19 take toll, and the tar­iff wars be­tween China and the United States, it is not go­ing to be a soft land­ing for the for­mer Nige­rian fi­nance min­is­ter. It is within the same space where she is also ex­pected to cor­rect the his­tor­i­cal trade im­bal­ances and ad­vo­cate for in­clu­sive trade poli­cies to en­sure that de­vel­op­ing na­tions will play in the same league as the rest of the world on trade and eco­nomic mat­ters. As she pre­pares to steer the ship in tur­bu­lent wa­ters, Okonjo-Iweala’s vi­sion on Africa should be guided by the pop­u­lar Nige­rian proverb that says; “No mat­ter how dark it is, the hand al­ways knows the way to the mouth.” ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170831,Why China brings jobs to Africa,"IN FACT, there has been some move­ment of Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­dus­try to an area of the world you might not ex­pect: Africa. Irene Yuan Sun, au­thor of the forth­com­ing book “The Next Fac­tory of the World”, has stud­ied this shift, and she thinks it’s a big deal. “Many of the things that Amer­i­cans buy in shop­ping malls are made by Chi­nese com­pa­nies, not in China, but ac­tu­ally in Africa,” Sun says. She points to Le­sotho, a tiny coun­try in south­ern Africa (only slightly big­ger than Mas­sachusetts). It has dozens of fac­to­ries that pro­duce cloth­ing and ap­parel for Levi’s, Kohl’s and Wal­mart. The work­ers may be from Le­sotho, but the own­ers are Chi­nese or Tai­wanese. And Sun es­ti­mates that only around 5 per­cent of Chi­nese man­u­fac­tur­ing has moved to Africa so far. But even that is enough to change the economies of African coun­tries like Le­sotho. And Sun be­lieves that it’s im­por­tant for Amer­i­cans to be aware of this shift. First, it rep­re­sents an op­por­tu­nity for Amer­i­can busi­nesses. For ex­am­ple, Chi­nese con­struc­tion firms are go­ing to Africa and build­ing mega-projects like rail­ways, ports and bridges. The equip­ment that these projects use is of­ten from Amer­i­can com­pa­nies like Gen­eral Elec­tric or Honey­well. The sec­ond rea­son Amer­i­cans should care is less busi­ness-ori­ented. Sun points out that Amer­ica has been heav­ily in­volved in try­ing to help al­le­vi­ate poverty in Africa for more than half a cen­tury. And though there have been some won­der­ful ac­com­plish­ments in that area, many African coun­tries re­main ex­tremely poor. “Now there’s this big new op­por­tu­nity in that Africa can in­dus­tri­alise and ac­tu­ally change the struc­ture of its economies by us­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing in­vest­ment from China,” says Sun. “So this is a his­toric op­por­tu­nity to­wards a goal that Amer­ica has been putting re­sources into for a long time.” Sun thinks that in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, with Chi­nese help, could lift a lot of African coun­tries out of poverty. She brings up the story of Ahmed Ibrahim. Ahmed grew up in a poverty-stricken part of Nige­ria with­out a de­cent for­mal ed­u­ca­tion, and like a lot of young peo­ple, he moved to the city to find work. He found some odd jobs, but noth­ing long-term. Then, he be­came a driver for a Chi­nese busi­ness­man who was look­ing to build a fac­tory in Nige­ria. Af­ter prov­ing him­self in­dis­pens­able, he worked his way up to a fac­tory man­age­ment po­si­tion and is now able to get jobs for his brother and the rest of his tribe. He has a sta­ble, mid­dle-class life. Which isn’t to say that China’s foray into Africa is en­tirely rosy. There are down­sides. In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is not an easy process. It wasn’t easy when it hap­pened in Amer­ica, and it wasn’t easy when it hap­pened in China. There are ma­jor en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, and this in­vest­ment is hap­pen­ing in an area of the world with­out a strong tra­di­tion of labour ad­vo­cacy. That can lead to African work­ers be­ing ex­ploited. Sun traced the story of a worker named Ken­neth Fred­er­ick who was elec­tro­cuted to death on the job at a Chi­nese fac­tory in Nige­ria. She tried to find out from labour ad­vo­cates, the me­dia, and the own­ers of the fac­tory what ex­actly hap­pened to Fred­er­ick, and she heard con­flict­ing re­ports and no clear an­swers. Sim­ply put, the sys­tems for pro­tect­ing work­ers are just not in place. But over­all, Sun be­lieves that Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa could be a pos­i­tive thing. “China it­self, through the last gen­er­a­tion, has gone through the most re­mark­able poverty al­le­vi­a­tion record that any coun­try in the world has,” Sun says. “And it’s done that on the back of at­tract­ing for­eign in­vest­ment.” The same sort of trans­for­ma­tion could hap­pen in Africa. In fact, when Sun talks to Chi­nese busi­ness­men about cities and towns in Ethiopia and Nige­ria, many of them tell her that they’re “just like my home­town 30 years ago.” PRI.",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20201113,"To cope with Covid-19, the poor need debt re­lief","COVID-19 has taken lives and dis­rupted liveli­hoods in every cor­ner of the globe. It has knocked more economies into si­mul­ta­ne­ous re­ces­sion than at any time since 1870. Ac­cord­ing to World Bank es­ti­mates, in its first year it may push up to 150 mil­lion peo­ple into ex­treme poverty, end­ing two decades of steady progress on poverty re­duc­tion. The cur­rent cri­sis stands in con­trast to the re­ces­sion of 2009, when much of the dam­age fell on fi­nan­cial as­sets and ad­vanced economies were hit harder than de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. This time the eco­nomic down­turn is much broader and deeper, and it has had an out­size im­pact on the poor­est coun­tries and the poor­est peo­ple within each coun­try, adding to in­equal­ity. It has hit work­ers whose jobs are un­steady or un­doc­u­mented, and many of the most vulnerable. The World Bank Group has moved rapidly to de­ploy its full fi­nan­cial ca­pac­ity. We are on track to com­mit a record $160 bil­lion over 15 months, and 40 per­cent of this amount was com­mit­ted in the first six months. Our fund­ing helps de­vel­op­ing coun­tries tackle the health, eco­nomic and so­cial im­pacts of the pan­demic. But even with the World Bank Group de­liv­er­ing mas­sive pos­i­tive net flows, the poor­est coun­tries need much more help. For the most im­pov­er­ished coun­tries, the cri­sis and as­so­ci­ated eco­nomic shut­downs came at a mo­ment of par­tic­u­lar peril. In 2019 al­most half of all low-income coun­tries were as­sessed by the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund to be ei­ther in debt dis­tress or at a high risk of it. With the pan­demic, the debt bur­den has got­ten much heav­ier due to the dev­as­tat­ing con­trac­tion in out­put, re­mit­tances and fam­ily income across the de­vel­op­ing world. If this mount­ing debt goes un­ad­dressed, it could lead to a lost decade for the world’s poor­est peo­ple. To cre­ate a recipe for re­cov­ery and growth, five in­gre­di­ents are ur­gently needed — a sus­tained debt-ser­vice sus­pen­sion, deep debt-bur­den re­duc­tion, fuller cred­i­tor par­tic­i­pa­tion, a level play­ing field to re­solve debt crises, and debt trans­parency to pro­tect the peo­ple. On their part, the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries them­selves also need to take steps to en­sure trans­par­ent and sus­tain­able na­tional poli­cies that sup­port the poor. A good first step, adopted by the Group of 20, is a debt-ser­vice sus­pen­sion by of­fi­cial bi­lat­eral cred­i­tors, which took ef­fect on May 1 af­ter a call from IMFdi­rec­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva and me. It al­lowed the poor­est coun­tries to use scarce re­sources to fund their pan­demic re­sponse in­stead of debt pay­ments. Yet re­lief so far has been less than an­tic­i­pated be­cause not all cred­i­tors par­tic­i­pated. Bond­hold­ers and other pri­vate cred­i­tors have gen­er­ally con­tin­ued to col­lect full re­pay­ments through­out the cri­sis while China’s par­tic­i­pa­tion was par­tial in scope. Re­cent steps taken by China to en­hance its en­gage­ment hold prom­ise. Par­tic­i­pants at this month’s G20 sum­mit are likely to urge more cred­i­tors to sus­pend debt pay­ments. This is wel­come, but the sus­pen­sion pro­vides only tem­po­rary debt re­lief, post­pon­ing pay­ments but not re­duc­ing the ul­ti­mate debt bur­den. For peo­ple in the poor­est coun­tries, there’s no light at the end of the tun­nel — only more gov­ern­ment debt. Kick­ing the can down the road should not be an op­tion. G20 cred­i­tors should seek timely and mean­ing­ful debt re­lief for dis­tressed bor­row­ers, through both lower in­ter­est rates and ac­tual write-downs in some cases. The com­mon frame­work reached by the G20 should avoid re­peat­ing the “ex­tend and pre­tend” ap­proach that de­layed re­cov­ery af­ter pre­vi­ous debt crises. The most im­pov­er­ished coun­tries need per­ma­nent fis­cal space to en­cour­age new in­vest­ment and cre­ate greener, more in­clu­sive growth. G20 gov­ern­ments should in­struct and cre­ate in­cen­tives for all their public bi­lat­eral cred­i­tors, and force­fully en­cour­age the pri­vate cred­i­tors un­der their ju­ris­dic­tion, to par­tic­i­pate fully in debt re­lief ef­forts. For now, too many cred­i­tors in G-20 coun­tries are con­tin­u­ing to take pay­ments. The ra­tio­nale for re­duc­ing the debt of the poor­est coun­tries is clear, but there’s no ex­ist­ing bank­ruptcy process to al­low speedy and eq­ui­table work­outs. In­stead the cur­rent play­ing field is tilted to favour cred­i­tors, in­clud­ing the vul­ture va­ri­ety, over poorer bor­row­ers. It leaves no vi­able es­cape from poverty for the peo­ple of the debtor coun­tries. Given the sever­ity of the cri­sis, debt re­struc­tur­ings need to re­duce the amount owed and should be reached with less lit­i­ga­tion and more trans­parency re­gard­ing their terms. This may re­quire leg­is­la­tion in the G20’s ma­jor cap­i­tals to rec­on­cile bet­ter their public in­ten­tions to sup­port the poor­est coun­tries with laws that work against debt re­duc­tion. The re­sis­tance to debt re­duc­tion and trans­parency is in­tense. Air­tight non dis­clo­sure agree­ments of­ten pro­tect con­tracts, leav­ing their terms se­cret. Trans­parency is the only way to bal­ance the in­ter­ests of the peo­ple with the in­ter­ests of those signing the debt and in­vest­ment con­tracts. G20 coun­tries should re­quire their public cred­i­tor in­sti­tu­tions to disclose all debt con­tracts and make re­fi­nanc­ing agree­ments public. De­vel­op­ing-coun­try gov­ern­ments must play their part. They need to re­quest debt re­lief from their cred­i­tors. Bor­rower gov­ern­ments should also refuse non dis­clo­sure clauses and make all their debt deal­ings trans­par­ent, as well as their spend­ing. They need to adopt na­tional poli­cies that are fis­cally sus­tain­able, and which ac­tively ben­e­fit the poor. These steps can help avoid a ma­jor set­back for development and help peo­ple in poverty-stricken coun­tries break out of the dev­as­tat­ing eco­nomic cy­cle that sov­er­eign debt crises bring.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180313,China pushes growth and anti-cor­rup­tion,"THE im­pos­ing Great Hall of the People, in the cen­tre of Beijing, bears wit­ness to China’s demo­cratic pol­i­tics. In 2013, in­side its mag­nif­i­cent au­di­to­rium, Xi Jin­ping was elected Pres­i­dent of the People’s Repub­lic of China by nearly 3 000 deputies to the Na­tional People’s Congress (NPC). This month when the congress con­venes, deputies are ex­pected to once again elect a pres­i­dent. Xi took over the pres­i­dency at a time when pub­lic con­cerns were com­mon about cor­rup­tion, the wealth gap and pol­lu­tion. Af­ter be­ing elected, Pres­i­dent Xi said, “In face of the mighty trend of the times and earnest ex­pec­ta­tions of the people for a bet­ter life, we can­not have the slight­est com­pla­cency, or get the slight­est bit slack at work.” He ex­pounded his vi­sion of a Chi­nese Dream of na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion to be made true by and for the people. Five years on, China has made his­toric achieve­ments. The Chi­nese are much more op­ti­mistic. Zheng Changzhong, a po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor with Fu­dan Univer­sity, said he would give the lead­er­ship a high ap­proval rat­ing. “Not only did China achieve steady de­vel­op­ment, we have also cre­ated a model to ad­vance hu­man civil­i­sa­tion,” Zheng said. “Be­hind th­ese achieve­ments, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping played his vi­tal lead­ing role as a lingxiu (charis­matic leader).” Re-elected gen­eral sec­re­tary of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee last Oc­to­ber, Pres­i­dent Xi said the Chi­nese na­tion, which since mod­ern times had en­dured so much for so long, achieved a tremen­dous trans­for­ma­tion: it has stood up, grown rich and is be­com­ing strong. Co­min­ing closer to Chi­nese dream There is no bet­ter way for the or­di­nary people to feel that strength than hav­ing a fuller pocket. Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi’s lead­er­ship, the Chi­nese econ­omy kept grow­ing steadily over the past five years. The year 2017 ended on a strong foot­ing, with an an­nual 6.9 per­cent growth rate. The size of the econ­omy ex­panded to more than 82 tril­lion yuan ($13 tril­lion) from 54 tril­lion yuan, re­tain­ing its place as the sec­ond largest in the world. China’s per capita dis­pos­able in­come stood at 25,974 yuan last year, up 7,3 per­cent year-on-year in real terms. Res­i­dents saw their salaries ris­ing steadily over the past five years. Liu He, a prom­i­nent fig­ure in Pres­i­dent Xi’s eco­nomic team, re­vealed at the 2018 World Eco­nomic Fo­rum that China’s mid­dle-in­come pop­u­la­tion had reached 400 mil­lion and was still grow­ing. The poor are get­ting rich much faster. Ex­perts ex­pect the coun­try’s 282-mil­lion-strong mi­grant work­ers to be­come a ma­jor force to make into the mid­dle-in­come group. Zou Bin, 23, is one of the young mi­grants who have wit­nessed the change over the past five years. Zou started out young, lay­ing bricks at a con­struc­tion site in Hu­nan Prov­ince upon leav­ing high school. He took his job se­ri­ously and worked hard. In 2015, Zou was al­ready top of his trade and rep­re­sented China in a global vo­ca­tional skills cham­pi­onship. He also earned him­self a place in the For­tune 500 firm China Con­struc­tion Group, re­ceiv­ing higher pay and lead­ing a team of his own. This year, Zou even made it to the Great Hall of the People as an NPC deputy. To give hard-work­ing people like Zou what they de­serve, Pres­i­dent Xi took bold re­forms to grow the econ­omy and let wealth be dis­trib­uted more fairly. Th­ese were not achieved by crank­ing up money print­ers but through a se­ries of re­forms. Pres­i­dent Xi took the helm of the Cen­tral Lead­ing Group for Deep­en­ing Over­all Re­form. More than 1 500 re­form mea­sures have been in­tro­duced by the cen­tral au­thor­i­ties: sup­ply-side struc­tural re­form to bal­ance the econ­omy, cut­ting gov­ern­ment red tape and bu­reau­cracy to en­cour­age medium-and-small busi­nesses, and the open­ing of free trade zones across the coun­try. Over the past five years, 66 mil­lion ur­ban jobs - a num­ber com­pa­ra­ble to the Bri­tish pop­u­la­tion - were cre­ated. To bal­ance in­come, China cut perks and ben­e­fits for of­fi­cials and lim­ited state firm bosses’ pay. On the other hand, work­ers and pro­fes­sion­als re­ceived higher salaries, while old-age and health care pen­sions im­proved. Pres­i­dent Xi made a solemn prom­ise on poverty re­duc­tion, with an am­bi­tion to elim­i­nate poverty in all poor coun­ties and re­gions by 2020. And the coun­try is get­ting there. More than 68,5 mil­lion people had been lifted out of poverty over the past five years. That means 37 000 people es­caped poverty ev­ery sin­gle day. Pres­i­dent Xi vowed that “no one should be left be­hind”. To ful­fil this mis­sion, Party and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials took turns to stay in poor vil­lages. They helped craft out in­di­vid­u­alised poverty re­duc­tion plans for ev­ery fam­ily and worked with them to achieve their goal. Jiang Fu’an was one such cadre. In 2015, Jiang, then a pre­fec­ture gov­ern­ment au­di­tor, ar­rived at a re­mote moun­tain­ous vil­lage in Liang­shan Yi Au­ton­o­mous Pre­fec­ture in Sichuan Prov­ince. He walked door to door to visit each of the more than a hun­dred poor house­holds. With his help, dozens of poor chil­dren got ed­u­ca­tion near their home. But in 2016, be­fore fin­ish­ing his stint, Jiang col­lapsed on the job and died. He was just 26 years old. The vil­lage was in grief. Jiang was re­mem­bered for sac­ri­fic­ing his life for a great cause. Liang­shan, with its stub­born poverty, is a con­cern for Pres­i­dent Xi. Ahead of the 2018 Lu­nar New Year, he chose here for his in­spec­tion tour, vis­it­ing homes of the poor Yi eth­nic vil­lagers and pledg­ing to “ban­ish” the ghost of poverty. “Our so­cial­ist sys­tem is to let people of all eth­nic groups live a great life,” Pres­i­dent Xi said. Wil­liam Jones, Wash­ing­ton bureau chief of the Ex­ec­u­tive In­tel­li­gence Re­view news mag­a­zine, said end­ing poverty had long been re­garded a ma­jor task for hu­man­ity, but un­til re­cently was seen as a “utopian dream.” “With China, that dream is now be­com­ing a re­al­ity,” he said. Cleaner China Pres­i­dent Xi also waged a war on pol­lu­tion. When he be­gan the pres­i­dency, eco­log­i­cal degra­da­tion had be­come a ma­jor chal­lenge fac­ing hu­man­ity. Pres­i­dent Xi at­tended the Paris cli­mate summit and a few months later China signed the Paris Agree­ment. Beijing, plagued by per­sis­tent smog, has been at the cen­tre of the strug­gle since the State Coun­cil launched a na­tional air pol­lu­tion con­trol cam­paign in 2013. Last year, Bei­jingers shelved their face masks as the num­ber of “se­verely pol­luted” days dropped to just 23, com­pared with 58 in 2013. The mu­nic­i­pal au­thor­i­ties said that for nine months in 2017, the PM 2,5 lev­els lin­gered around the low­est point in five years. Across the coun­try, the av­er­age den­sity of PM 2,5 in 338 cities was 43 mi­cro­grams per cu­bic me­ters, fall­ing 6,5 per­cent year on year. Progress was also made in the pro­tec­tion of wa­ter and soil re­sources. China also be­gan to set up na­tional parks. At least 10 are in trial op­er­a­tion. A Gi­ant Panda Na­tional Park, span­ning three prov­inces, is three times the size of Amer­ica’s Yel­low­stone Na­tional Park. En­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion fea­tures promi­nently in Pres­i­dent Xi’s five-sphere in­te­grated plan to pro­mote co­or­di­nated eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal, cul­tural, so­cial and eco­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment. The Party’s lead­er­ship over all work is vi­tal to turn­ing plans into ac­tion, ob­servers said. Also “cleaner” is the pub­lic of­fice as Pres­i­dent Xi de­clared war on an­other age-old hu­man can­cer: cor­rup­tion. In 2013, Pres­i­dent Xi de­scribed cor­rup­tion as an ex­is­ten­tial threat ca­pa­ble of bring­ing down the Party and the state. And he was se­ri­ous about it. The en­su­ing crack­down achieved spec­tac­u­lar suc­cess. Ev­ery cor­ner of the sys­tem was ex­am­ined, lead­ing to pun­ish­ment of more than 1,5 mil­lion of­fi­cials in five years. A to­tal of 440 cen­trally-ad­min­is­trated of­fi­cials had been in­ves­ti­gated since Novem­ber 2012, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures in the work re­port of the 18th Cen­tral Com­mis­sion for Dis­ci­pline In­spec­tion of the CPC. Sun Zheng­cai, a former mem­ber of the Po­lit­i­cal Bureau of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and former Party chief of Chongqing, was the lat­est se­nior of­fi­cial to be charged for graft. Other “tigers” brought down in­clude Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xi­lai, Guo Box­iong, Xu Cai­hou, Ling Ji­hua. The cam­paign con­tin­ued af­ter the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress last Oc­to­ber, with the Party’s dis­ci­plinary watch­dog hav­ing an­nounced in­ves­ti­ga­tion into nine other se­nior of­fi­cials - in­clud­ing former State Coun­cilor Yang Jing - in a lit­tle more than 100 days since then. Cor­rupt low rank­ing of­fi­cials re­ferred to as flies - were swat­ted too. The anti-cor­rup­tion drive was im­mensely pop­u­lar. A pub­lic opin­ion poll showed an ap­proval rat­ing of a whop­ping 93,9 per­cent. To in­stall in­sti­tu­tional checks, Xi ini­ti­ated the su­per­vi­sory re­form. Su­per­vi­sion com­mis­sions were set up at the pro­vin­cial, mu­nic­i­pal and county lev­els just in four months af­ter the 19th CPC Na­tional Congress.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20201127,Re­view of the NDS-1,"THE Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1 (NDS-1) was of­fi­cially launched by Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa on Mon­day Novem­ber 16, 2020. The NDS-1 has 14 pri­or­i­ties which in­clude: Eco­nomic growth and sta­bil­ity; food and nu­tri­tion se­cu­rity; gov­er­nance; mov­ing the econ­omy up the value chain and struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion; hu­man cap­i­tal de­vel­op­ment; en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, cli­mate re­silience and nat­u­ral re­source man­age­ment; hous­ing de­liv­ery; dig­i­tal econ­omy; health and well-be­ing; in­fra­struc­ture and util­i­ties; im­age build­ing and in­ter­na­tional en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment; so­cial pro­tec­tion; youth, sport and cul­ture; and de­vo­lu­tion. The NDS-1 seeks to move the coun­try from a lower mid­dle-in­come so­ci­ety to­wards an up­per mid­dle-in­come so­ci­ety by 2030. The NDS-1 is an am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment strat­egy, which seeks to ad­dress some of the most bind­ing con­straints mil­i­tat­ing against in­clu­sive eco­nomic growth and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in the coun­try. In a de­par­ture from the past, the NDS-1 has clear macroe­co­nomic ob­jec­tives and tar­gets as well as so­cial and de­vel­op­ment ob­jec­tives and tar­gets. A ma­jor cri­tique of the out-go­ing Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) is that it has clear eco­nomic growth tar­gets with no ex­plicit tar­gets on em­ploy­ment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. The TSP is, there­fore, not based on a holis­tic ap­proach to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment that in­te­grates eco­nomic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­per­a­tives and con­sid­er­a­tions. It is rather pred­i­cated on the un­der­ly­ing con­ven­tional macro-eco­nomics as­sump­tion of “trickle down” that once eco­nomic growth is at­tained it will au­to­mat­i­cally re­sult in em­ploy­ment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. The NDS-1, how­ever, cor­rects the above anom­aly. For in­stance, the NDS-1 is tar­get­ing to cre­ate 760 000 jobs as well as eco­nomic growth of not less than 5% per an­num. This is quite am­bi­tious but fea­si­ble in my view es­pe­cially if we fo­cus on labour in­ten­sive sec­tors such as agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture projects. Jobs are crit­i­cal as they pro­vide a crit­i­cal nexus be­tween eco­nomic growth and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The NDS-1 is also tar­get­ing to re­duce the per­cent­age of Zim­bab­weans who are in ex­treme poverty to 10,1% in 2025 down from 38,9% in 2020. Fo­cus­ing on pover­tyre­duc­ing sec­tors such as agri­cul­ture, health, so­cial pro­tec­tion and ed­u­ca­tion will help to re­alise the poverty tar­gets. The NDS-1 is tar­get­ing uni­ver­sal so­cial pro­tec­tion cov­er­age by 2025. On a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment, the NDS-1 has a clear re­sults frame­work and im­ple­men­ta­tion ma­trix for bet­ter ex­e­cu­tion and ac­count­abil­ity. Past de­vel­op­ment strate­gies have tended to lack an im­ple­men­ta­tion ma­trix mak­ing it dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment them and to hold any­one ac­count­able. The NDS-1 has how­ever not been costed to de­ter­mine the to­tal fi­nanc­ing re­quire­ments. How­ever, what is in­dis­putable is the fact that the coun­try has a huge fi­nanc­ing gap ow­ing to years of gross un­der in­vest­ments in crit­i­cal sec­tors of the econ­omy. The NDS-1 en­vis­ages that de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance will in­crease from US$500 mil­lion in 2020 to US$1 bil­lion by 2025. This is un­sus­tain­able. We need to be mov­ing away from donor fi­nanc­ing. Op­por­tu­ni­ties abound for greater do­mes­tic re­source mo­bil­i­sa­tion. For in­stance, broad­en­ing the tax­a­tion base through fa­cil­i­tat­ing tran­si­tion from in­for­mal­ity to for­mal­ity is one such op­por­tu­nity. This can be achieved through the cre­ation of en­abling and sup­port­ive pol­icy, in­sti­tu­tional and reg­u­la­tory, that re­duces the cost of do­ing busi­ness and im­proves the in­vest­ment cli­mate as well as low­er­ing the bar­ri­ers and high cost of tran­si­tion to for­mal­ity. The full op­er­a­tional­i­sa­tion of the Sov­er­eign Wealth Fund is also crit­i­cal to en­sure greater mo­bil­i­sa­tion of do­mes­tic sav­ings. Do­mes­tic sav­ings are crit­i­cal for in­clu­sive growth and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment as re­vealed by the growth suc­cess sto­ries of coun­tries such as China, Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, Ja­pan and In­dia, among oth­ers. For in­stance, the spec­tac­u­lar eco­nomic growth of China in the past four decades has been as­so­ci­ated with an equally re­mark­able high rate of sav­ing. The gross na­tional sav­ing as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) has av­er­aged 40%, reach­ing an un­prece­dented 53% in 2007. The high and ris­ing ag­gre­gate sav­ing and, thus the low and de­clin­ing share of con­sump­tion in the GDP, con­sti­tute a cen­tral fea­ture of the Chi­nese econ­omy. In Zim­babwe, for a long time put gross na­tional sav­ings as a per­cent­age of GDP has been in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory for a long time im­ply­ing that we are a highly con­sump­tion-driven econ­omy, and con­sump­tion is the enemy of in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment. It is there­fore im­por­tant go­ing for­ward to en­trench macroe­co­nomic sta­bil­ity as a ba­sis of pro­mot­ing do­mes­tic sav­ings. The di­as­pora can also play a greater role in terms of fi­nanc­ing de­vel­op­ment back home given the right eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal in­cen­tives. For in­stance, di­as­pora bonds are a rel­a­tively in­ex­pen­sive way of rais­ing funds for de­vel­op­ment back home. A num­ber of African coun­tries such as Kenya, Ethiopia and Nige­ria have in the past suc­cess­fully is­sued di­as­pora in­fra­struc­ture bonds to help fi­nance in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. Di­as­pora en­gage­ment does not fea­ture promi­nently in the NDS-1 and this must be cor­rected. Im­por­tantly, the NDS-1 com­pletely left out people with dis­abil­i­ties. Notwith­stand­ing this omis­sion, the Ed­u­ca­tion Amend­ment Act, 2020 which came into ef­fect on March 6, 2020 and aligns the Ed­u­ca­tion Act (Chap­ter 25:04) with the Con­sti­tu­tion guar­an­tees the right of pupils with dis­abil­i­ties to be pro­vided with suit­able in­fra­struc­ture. It is there­fore nec­es­sary to en­sure that ad­e­quate bud­getary re­sources are al­lo­cated to en­sure the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Ed­u­ca­tion Amend­ment Act. The NDS-1 is com­ing at a time when the econ­omy has been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing some mea­sure of macro-eco­nomic sta­bil­ity as ev­i­denced by the slow­ing down in­fla­tion re­sult­ing in some mea­sure of price sta­bil­ity as well as ex­change rate sta­bil­ity. The cur­rent ac­count sur­plus has pro­vided a strong ba­sis for sus­tain­ing for­eign ex­change sta­bil­ity. In­dus­try ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion has also shown some gains. Chal­lenges, how­ever, still re­main with re­spect to the high lev­els of poverty, food in­se­cu­rity, in­for­mal­ity and pub­lic in­debt­ed­ness; the lim­ited fis­cal space; in­ad­e­quate so­cial pro­tec­tion cov­er­age; weak in­sti­tu­tions; cor­rup­tion; huge in­fra­struc­ture deficit par­tic­u­larly in terms of wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion; weak pub­lic health de­liv­ery sys­tem ow­ing to years of gross un­der­in­vest­ment among oth­ers. Main­tain­ing price sta­bil­ity is crit­i­cal and will de­pend largely on the abil­ity to con­trol/bri­dle money sup­ply growth. How­ever, given the huge de­mands/pres­sures on the ex­pen­di­ture side and the lim­ited fis­cal space, there is a pos­si­bil­ity that gov­ern­ment may be forced to seek re­course to mon­e­tary fi­nanc­ing and/or even do­mes­tic bor­row­ing. Gov­ern­ment re­cently signed the Global Com­pen­sa­tion Deed with for­mer white farm­ers val­ued at US$3,5 bil­lion. It is not yet very clear how this is go­ing to be fi­nanced but there is a pos­si­bil­ity that gov­ern­ment could is­sue bonds which would worsen the debt po­si­tion thereby af­fect­ing the coun­try’s re-en­gage­ment ef­forts given our cur­rent huge ar­rears. Ul­ti­mately, the suc­cess or lack thereof of the NDS-1, de­pends on whether we have strong, ac­count­able, trans­par­ent, and in­clu­sive in­sti­tu­tions to drive its im­ple­men­ta­tion as well as a sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing model re­ly­ing largely on do­mes­tic re­sources to fi­nance it. Strength­en­ing of in­sti­tu­tions will also help to re­store con­fi­dence, pro­mote cap­i­tal and in­vest­ment in­flows as well as to tackle leak­ages such as il­licit fi­nan­cial flows.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170410,Ac­cel­er­at­ing hu­man de­vel­op­ment in Zim,"THE Gov­ern­ments of China and Zim­babwe are un­der­tak­ing, with the fa­cil­i­ta­tion of the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP), the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of pri­or­ity ar­eas for in­vest­ment un­der the frame­work of South-South co-op­er­a­tion. South-South co-op­er­a­tion is a broad frame­work for col­lab­o­ra­tion among coun­tries of the South in the po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, so­cial, cul­tural, en­vi­ron­men­tal and tech­ni­cal do­mains. In­volv­ing two or more de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, it can take place on a bi­lat­eral, re­gional, sub-re­gional or in­ter­re­gional ba­sis. Re­cent de­vel­op­ments in SouthSouth co-op­er­a­tion have taken the form of in­creased vol­ume of SouthSouth trade, South-South flows of for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, move­ments to­wards re­gional in­te­gra­tion, tech­nol­ogy transfers, shar­ing of so­lu­tions and ex­perts, and other forms of ex­changes. The fa­cil­i­ta­tion of South-South co-op­er­a­tion by WFP comes hot on the heels of the launch of WFP’s firstof-its kind five-year Strate­gic Plan this week to sup­port food se­cu­rity pro­grammes to the tune of $253 mil­lion for 2017-2021, a con­tri­bu­tion to na­tional ini­tia­tives to end hunger. The co-op­er­a­tion and part­ner­ship be­tween the sis­terly coun­tries of Zim­babwe and China is not a new phe­nom­e­non. Both coun­tries en­joy deeply rooted his­tor­i­cal ties. Ties strength­ened by sol­i­dar­ity and friend­ship, as the re­cent gen­er­ous over $25 mil­lion sup­port of the Gov­ern­ment and the peo­ple of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China pro­vided to as­sist Zim­babwe com­bat the re­cent drought and flood­ing dis­as­ters at­test. Although the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing in ex­treme poverty dropped by more than half be­tween 1990 and 2015 (from 1,9 bil­lion to 836 mil­lion), too many peo­ple are still strug­gling to meet the most ba­sic hu­man needs. Glob­ally, an es­ti­mated two bil­lion peo­ple suf­fer from mi­cro-nu­tri­ent de­fi­cien­cies, im­ped­ing hu­man and so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. More than 66 mil­lion pri­mary-school-age chil­dren at­tend classes hun­gry across the de­vel­op­ing world, 23 mil­lion in Africa alone. To­day, erad­i­cat­ing poverty in all its forms re­mains one of hu­man­ity’s great­est chal­lenges. Here in Zim­babwe, we face the twin chal­lenges of lin­ger­ing food and nu­tri­tion in­se­cu­rity due to re­cur­rent droughts on the one hand, and flood­ing as a re­sult of the ef­fects of cli­mate change, which have ren­dered 40 per­cent of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion vul­ner­a­ble. Ac­cord­ing to ZimS­tat, the un­der­ly­ing poverty, af­fect­ing 76 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion in gen­eral is the re­sult of a pro­tracted un­der-per­for­mance of the econ­omy and the re­sul­tant high lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment and un­der-em­ploy­ment, par­tic­u­larly among the youth and women. Rapid global eco­nomic growth and in­creased agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity in the pre­vi­ous two decades have re­duced the pro­por­tion of the world’s un­der­nour­ished pop­u­la­tion by al­most 50 per­cent. Many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries pre­vi­ously af­fected by famine and hunger can now meet the nu­tri­tional needs of the most vul­ner­a­ble. Much more is needed, how­ever, to end hunger and erad­i­cate poverty by 2030. Ex­treme hunger and mal­nu­tri­tion re­main huge bar­ri­ers to de­vel­op­ment in many coun­tries. As es­ti­mated 800 mil­lion peo­ple are chron­i­cally un­der­nour­ished, of­ten as a di­rect con­se­quence of en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, drought and loss of bio­di­ver­sity. The so­lu­tion is in our hands, through the pro­mo­tion of ini­tia­tives such as South-South co-op­er­a­tion, which of­fers good prac­tices for the ac­cel­er­a­tion of sus­tain­able hu­man de­vel­op­ment that can in­creas­ingly be tapped from the global South. They can be found in the poli­cies, in­sti­tu­tions and pro­grammes that have en­abled a num­ber of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to ac­quire a skilled labour force, cre­ate de­cent jobs, raise pro­duc­tiv­ity and lift mil­lions of their ci­ti­zens out of grind­ing poverty. In ad­dress­ing poverty and hunger in Zim­babwe, the United Na­tions be­lieves part­ner­ing with ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties can con­trib­ute im­mensely in the bet­ter­ment of liveli­hoods through di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of agri­cul­ture, com­mu­nity as­set build­ing and ac­cess to en­ergy. The Gov­ern­ments of Zim­babwe and China, in col­lab­o­ra­tion with WFP are se­lect­ing in­vest­ment pri­or­i­ties in some of these ar­eas. This ex­er­cise would greatly ben­e­fit from a few con­sid­er­a­tions, which I out­line be­low: First, a par­tic­i­pa­tory ap­proach to the de­sign of ac­tiv­i­ties, in­volv­ing the in­tended ben­e­fi­cia­ries in the spec­i­fi­ca­tion, de­mand and im­ple­men­ta­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties and part­nered with min­istries, de­ci­sion mak­ers and key gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties. Sec­ond, In­vest­ment projects with clear and signed agree­ments with vil­lages and gov­ern­ment part­ners in which they com­mit to pro­vid­ing coun­ter­part or in-kind re­sources in or­der to ben­e­fit from the part­ner­ship. Thirdly, a multi-sec­toral ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment that in­cludes train­ing on func­tional lit­er­acy and pro­vi­sion of clean en­ergy equip­ment and func­tional road net­works along with sup­port for the vil­lages to sus­tain­ably man­age the clean en­ergy. This will fa­cil­i­tate ex­perts and tech­nol­ogy trans­fer from China to Zim­babwe, the over­all ob­jec­tive of the in­vest­ment should ad­vance confidence build­ing that con­trib­utes to im­prove­ments in vil­lagers’ di­ets, ed­u­ca­tion and qual­ity of life by sup­port­ing prac­ti­cal steps that en­hance liveli­hoods and even­tual poverty re­duc­tion. Ul­ti­mately, own­er­ship and lead­er­ship of lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties and the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe is key to the ac­com­plish­ments and sus­tain­abil­ity of those se­lected in­vest­ment projects. Up-front train­ing and sup­port to com­mu­ni­ties is very im­por­tant. The in­vest­ment pri­or­i­ties that will be se­lected should have a di­rect bear­ing on im­prov­ing food se­cu­rity, so­cial pro­tec­tion and school at­ten­dance in re­duc­ing or end­ing hunger. Let us work to­gether to help the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe to cre­ate long-term, last­ing so­lu­tions to de­feat hunger and poverty by build­ing lo­cal skills and knowl­edge, pro­mot­ing food and nu­tri­tion se­cu­rity through school feed­ing pro­grammes, and con­tribut­ing to the achieve­ment of the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. The United Na­tions re­mains com­mit­ted to ex­tend­ing tech­ni­cal sup­port to the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe for the de­sign and im­ple­men­ta­tion of agreed in­vest­ment pri­or­i­ties and ac­tiv­i­ties.",津巴布韦

The an­nual ses­sion for the top ad­vi­sory body will end on March 13. Ad­dress­ing a press con­fer­ence at­tended by hun­dreds of jour­nal­ists from Chi­nese, South East Asian and African coun­tries in­clud­ing Zim­babwe, vice chair­man for for­eign af­fairs com­mit­tee of the na­tional com­mit­tee of the CPPCC, Mr Wang Guo­qing said the an­nual con­fer­ence was ex­pected to hear and de­lib­er­ate on the grand re­port on the work of the stand­ing com­mit­tee of the CPPCC na­tional com­mit­tee and also dis­cuss on how the stand­ing com­mit­tee de­lib­er­ated on pro­pos­als made by mem­bers dur­ing the pre­vi­ous ses­sion last year. Mr Wang also said de­lib­er­a­tions were also go­ing to in­clude the state of the econ­omy of China, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. “There will be com­mit­tee meet­ings, joint group dis­cus­sions and press con­fer­ences on the Chi­nese econ­omy, peo­ple’s lives - so­cially and cul­tur­ally. “All prepa­ra­tions for the open­ing of the ses­sion are com­plete. Three ple­nary meet­ings will be opened to Chi­nese and for­eign me­dia,” he said. Re­spond­ing to jour­nal­ists, Mr Wang said China had con­tin­ued work­ing to­wards poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and also ob­served sta­bil­ity as a key el­e­ment in eco­nomic growth. He said the Chi­nese GDP had con­tin­ued to grow and had contributed im­mensely to the world econ­omy. “China has also con­tin­ued to of­fer more prod­ucts and valu­able op­por­tu­ni­ties of co­op­er­a­tion. As long as we ad­dress chal­lenges, the Chi­nese econ­omy will re­main the ma­jor driver of the world econ­omy. “I be­lieve that decades of prac­tices and main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity is important for gov­ern­ment pol­icy on de­vel­op­ment. We have been seek­ing progress while main­tain­ing sta­bil­ity. This means press­ing ahead in a steady way,” he said.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20210321,Di­as­pora can­not be ig­nored,"The 1 bil­lion re­mit­tances that Zim­babwe re­ceived last year from the Di­as­pora de­mands that more at­ten­tion be ac­corded to that con­stituency as it be­comes in­creas­ingly im­por­tant in this coun­try’s so­cio-eco­nomic dy­nam­ics. TUS$ HAT the Di­as­pora now ranks as one of the ma­jor con­trib­u­tors to Zim­babwe’s ex­port earn­ings and the 58 per­cent jump in re­mit­tances from US$635 mil­lion, means it can­not be ig­nored. Sta­tis­tics show that it comes af­ter platinum as the sec­ond high­est. The min­eral reg­is­tered US$1,7 bil­lion in earn­ings in 2020. The cen­tral bank last month at­trib­uted the rise to the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the use of free funds and in­creased use of for­mal chan­nels due to lock­downs. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund de­scribes re­mit­tances as largely house­hold in­comes from na­tion­als in for­eign coun­tries who would have moved tem­po­rar­ily or per­ma­nently. Zim­babwe is es­ti­mated to have be­tween three mil­lion and four mil­lion of its na­tion­als liv­ing out­side the coun­try, par­tic­u­larly in South Africa, United King­dom and Aus­tralia. These have had a huge bear­ing on the wel­fare of their fam­i­lies back home, par­tic­u­larly over the past two decades when the econ­omy has ex­pe­ri­enced dif­fi­cul­ties. Re­search done early in the mil­len­nium showed that at least 50 per­cent of house­holds in this coun­try rely on re­mit­tances. This fig­ure is ex­pected to have risen sig­nif­i­cantly over the past decades. It is in this frame that au­thor­i­ties need to come up with strate­gies to har­ness the po­ten­tial of the Di­as­pora fac­tor in at­tain­ing an Up­per Mid­dle- In­come Econ­omy by 2030. The United King­dom Depart­ment of In­ter­na­tional Mi­gra­tion (2002) as­serts that in­for­mal re­mit­tances rep­re­sent two or three times the amount of for­mal trans­fer of funds. This means that ef­fec­tively Zim­babwe earns more than the $1 bil­lion cap­tured in our books. Of course as stated by the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe, many were forced to opt for for­mal chan­nels last year due to lock­downs, but it is gen­er­ally be­lieved that non-res­i­dent Zim­bab­weans send money back home via buses and trucks, par­tic­u­larly from South Africa, and friends and fam­ily in other cases. While the re­mit­tances have helped keep fam­i­lies above the Poverty Da­tum Line, there is more that the Di­as­pora can do in con­tribut­ing to na­tional eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. In­deed the use of for­mal ways of send­ing money en­sures the funds are in­jected into the na­tional econ­omy. The mul­ti­plier ef­fects of in­duc­ing sav­ings and in­vest­ment, and in­creas­ing the de­mand for goods and ser­vices is quite ben­e­fi­cial to the econ­omy. The re­mit­tances have largely been for bridg­ing the gap be­tween in­comes and con­sump­tion. The fig­ures for Zim­babwe have been grow­ing steadily from about US$294 mil­lion in 2009 to a peak of US$935 mil­lion in 2015. Re­ceipts then dropped to US$635 mil­lion last year be­fore the phe­nom­e­nal growth to the $1 bil­lion mark, ahead of the US$994 mil­lion gold earn­ings. A num­ber of coun­tries in Africa and be­yond rely on re­mit­tances to sus­tain liveli­hoods. In fact, Asian pow­er­houses such as South Korea, China and In­dia ex­pe­ri­enced phe­nom­e­nal eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tions from Di­as­pora re­mit­tances. Today these coun­tries stand as gi­ants, with China ris­ing to be­come the sec­ond largest global econ­omy. Last year the coun­try re­ceived US$60 bil­lion from the Di­as­pora. De­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as Nige­ria, Ghana, Thai­land and Bangladesh also de­pend heav­ily on re­mit­tances from abroad. In 2012, Zim­babwe’s Sta­tis­ti­cal Agency noted that some of the funds from the Di­as­pora were chan­nelled to­wards so­cial pro­grammes usu­ally ne­glected by aid or other forms of de­vel­op­ment fi­nance. Un­der Image Build­ing, In­ter­na­tional En­gage­ment and Re-en­gage­ment work­ing group, the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1 seeks to im­prove Di­as­pora par­tic­i­pa­tion in the econ­omy through a re­view of the Di­as­pora Pol­icy of 2016 and to en­act en­abling leg­is­la­tion. It will pro­mote “in­side-out” or home­land driven Di­as­pora en­gage­ment while also es­tab­lish­ing for­mal in­sti­tu­tional and co-or­di­na­tion struc­tures. The Govern­ment in­tends to es­tab­lish trade and in­vest­ment frame­works to pro­mote pub­lic-pri­vate-part­ner­ships in­volv­ing Di­as­pora con­sor­tiums. These strate­gies look set to in­crease the role of non-res­i­dent Zim­bab­weans in the econ­omy. Many of them have lamented the ab­sence of tai­lor-made in­vest­ment op­tions in which they can in­vest their funds. But au­thor­i­ties need to move with haste to en­sure greater par­tic­i­pa­tion by the Di­as­po­rans sooner rather than later. They can do more to en­sure at­tain­ment of the 7,4 per­cent GDP growth and tar­gets for suc­ceed­ing years. Re­search has shown that Di­as­po­rans do not bring home just money, but ideas, mind­sets, world views, val­ues, at­ti­tudes and norms of be­hav­iour whose sum-to­tal is crit­i­cal in fos­ter­ing de­vel­op­ment. Mi­gra­tion ex­perts have said that to reap macro-eco­nomic ben­e­fits from in­creased Di­as­pora re­mit­tances, it is crit­i­cal to build con­fi­dence in lo­cal fi­nan­cial sys­tems and to draft poli­cies that in­cen­tivise clus­ter in­vest­ments by the na­tion­als. These tend to be at a large-scale hence ben­e­fit­ing the econ­omy in many ways. In­deed the Govern­ment is in sync with this no­tion as in­di­cated in the Na­tional Di­as­pora Pol­icy of 2016 which iden­ti­fied eight key pri­or­ity ar­eas that re­late to poli­cies and leg­is­la­tion, the in­tra-gov­ern­men­tal-di­as­pora re­la­tion­ship, in­sti­tu­tional en­gage­ment, di­as­pora in­vest­ment, re­mit­tances, na­tional so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and know­ing the di­as­pora and di­as­pora’s rights. “The Govern­ment recog­nises that be­yond the re­mit­tances from abroad, our di­as­pora presents so­cial, eco­nomic, in­tel­lec­tual and po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal, a pool of knowl­edge and ex­per­tise which must be har­nessed for the ben­e­fit of the coun­try,” said the then Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary in the Min­istry of Macro-Eco­nomic Plan­ning and In­vest­ment Pro­mo­tion Ms Ju­dith Ka­teera at a meet­ing held to dis­cuss im­ple­men­ta­tion of the pol­icy, for­mu­lated with as­sis­tance from the United Na­tions Mi­gra­tion Agency and the Euro­pean Union. The Di­as­po­rans need to be made to feel im­por­tant so they can fully par­tic­i­pate in re­build­ing the econ­omy. Zim­babwe needs their money, skills, ideas and the im­par­ta­tion of the skills and tech­nol­ogy ac­quired in their coun­tries of res­i­dence. As the world in­creas­ingly be­comes a global vil­lage, the only way to com­pete ef­fec­tively is to as­sess and adopt what other coun­tries have de­vel­oped, not that we can­not come up with our own in­ven­tions, but we may not need to rein­vent the wheel is some in­stances. Adopt­ing and im­ple­ment­ing the new ideas and tech­nol­ogy in the form of farm­ing meth­ods, wa­ter har­vest­ing, In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy, man­u­fac­tur­ing, min­ing and other sec­tors of the econ­omy can ex­pe­dite the at­tain­ment of Vi­sion 2030. We hope a re­view of the pol­icy as stated in the NDS1 blue­print will re­sult in a more ro­bust Di­as­pora en­gage­ment thrust. How­ever, while we ac­knowl­edge the in­creas­ing im­por­tance of re­mit­tances, we must not lose sight of the rich nat­u­ral re­source en­dow­ments in this coun­try which we must ex­ploit as we seek to grow the econ­omy and im­prove our stan­dard of liv­ing. At some point Zim­babwe should grow its fi­nan­cial mus­cle to the ex­tent that fam­i­lies should ac­tu­ally send funds to sup­port their rel­a­tives and friends abroad. It is pos­si­ble and it can be done. It just takes de­ter­mi­na­tion and to­tal com­mit­ment to set goals. In God I trust! ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161222,Un­pack­ing the Bei­jing Con­sen­sus,"CHINA’S de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance model, which em­pha­sises on win-win co­op­er­a­ton, has the po­ten­tial to help fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­tries out of poverty. The de­vel­op­ment model, which some pre­fer to call the Bei­jing Con­sen­sus, is based on mu­tual re­spect, mu­tual ben­e­fit and mu­tual un­der­stand­ing. This is also the prin­ci­ple on which China’s for­eign pol­icy, which is aimed at main­tain­ing world peace and en­sur­ing that coun­tries con­cen­trate on de­vel­op­ment, is an­chored. China has a de­lib­er­ate pol­icy through which it treats other coun­tries as equal part­ners and main­tains a stance of non-in­ter­fer­ence in the sovereignty of other coun­tries. In fact, the ma­jor les­son from how the Asian coun­try is in­ter­act­ing with other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, es­pe­cially those in Africa, is that one should never un­der­es­ti­mate their de­vel­op­ment part­ners. This is in sharp con­trast to the Western model of de­vel­op­ment which is cen­tred around the Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus. Western coun­tries, which con­trol ma­jor in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment agen­cies like the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund and the World Bank, are known to im­pose nu­mer­ous political con­di­tions that hin­der the smooth flow of as­sis­tance to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. This means that coun­tries have to for­sake their own ini­tia­tives to de­velop them­selves and align them­selves to Western coun­tries’ views and poli­cies. This has a neg­a­tive ef­fect on the sovereignty of na­tions, as the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries have to dance to the tune of Western coun­tries for them to get as­sis­tance. For ex­am­ple, re­la­tions be­tween Zim­babwe and the IMF and the World Bank soured when Govern­ment em­barked on the land re­form pro­gramme and af­ter Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe crit­i­cised ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity. Ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity is not ac­cepted in many African coun­tries. But Zim­babwe was black­listed partly be­cause of its stance against ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity. On the land re­form, the Western coun­tries were con­cerned about pre­serv­ing the sta­tus of a few white farm­ers who lost land that was distributed to the ma­jor­ity. The land re­form pro­gramme was part of Zim­babwe’s de­vel­op­ment agenda, yet Western coun­tries con­sid­ered the fate of their kith and kin who lost the land. In­stead of part­ner­ing with Zim­babwe in its de­vel­op­ment as­pi­ra­tions, the Western coun­tries con­sid­ered the re­dis­tri­bu­tion of land to the land­less as an abuse of hu­man rights of about 4 500 white farm­ers. This is the op­po­site of the de­vel­op­men­tal agenda be­ing pur­sued by China. That de­vel­op­men­tal model en­sures that for­eign in­vest­ment does not in­ter­fere with the in­ter­nal af­fairs of other na­tions. This ex­plains why China has man­aged to trans­form the sta­tus of sev­eral de­vel­op­ing coun­tries within a short pe­riod. The model be­ing used by China is tar­geted at elim­i­nat­ing poverty and en­sur­ing that it raises the stan­dard of liv­ing in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. China and Africa have a lot in com­mon in terms of their his­tor­i­cal links and how im­pe­ri­al­ists in­ter­fered with their in­ter­nal af­fairs dur­ing coloni­sa­tion. And this is why China un­der­stands Africa’s de­vel­op­ment as­pi­ra­tions far much bet­ter than Western coun­tries do China realises that there will be no world peace as long as other con­ti­nents wal­low in poverty. Re­cent in­ter­ac­tions with top Chi­nese of­fi­cials showed that the Asian coun­try’s as­pi­ra­tion is to see peace pre­vail­ing in the world to al­low na­tions to con­cen­trate on up­lift­ing the lives of their cit­i­zens. Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has been lead­ing by ex­am­ple in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of such a de­vel­op­ment model. If sus­tain­ably pur­sued, China’s pol­icy to­wards de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, es­pe­cially those in Africa, will help bal­ance world af­fairs. At the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion meet­ing in Johannesburg, South Africa, last year, Pres­i­dent Xi ex­pounded this pol­icy. “What has made China-Africa friend­ship durable and vig­or­ous is that our two sides have al­ways been guided by the prin­ci­ple of treat­ing each other as equals, pro­mot­ing win-win progress and com­mon de­vel­op­ment and en­hanc­ing sin­cere friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion,” he said. “China and Africa will for­ever re­main good friends, good part­ners and good broth­ers.” China realises that Africa is now ready for rapid de­vel­op­ment, es­pe­cially con­sid­er­ing that the con­ti­nent possesses min­eral wealth that can be lever­aged to at­tract in­vest­ment. A good ob­ser­va­tion be­ing that most coun­tries on the con­ti­nent have their min­er­als still lodged un­der­ground and they do not have the means to ex­tract them. Min­er­als that are still un­der­ground are as good as a non-ex­is­tent in the de­vel­op­ment ma­trix of a coun­try. Most African coun­tries do not have the money to pay for the con­struc­tion of in­fras­truc­ture and for un­der­tak­ing other poverty al­le­vi­a­tion pro­jects. But China is awak­en­ing them to the re­al­ity that they can lever­age their min­er­als to help es­tab­lish the nec­es­sary in­fras­truc­ture. Pres­i­dent Xi sum­marised China’s pol­icy to­wards Africa as guided by political equal­ity and mu­tual trust, win­win eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, mu­tu­ally en­rich­ing cul­tural ex­changes, mu­tual as­sis­tance in se­cu­rity and sol­i­dar­ity and co­or­di­na­tion in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs. The 10-point plan for co­opera-. tion with African coun­tries, which he un­veiled at the Fo­cac sum­mit in South Africa, is in sync with the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The AU en­vis­ages that all the 54 coun­tries on the con­ti­nent should be en­joy­ing some form of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion by that year. But the con­ti­nen­tal body realises that such a feat can­not be achieved with­out the help of de­vel­op­ment part­ners. And this is where China has proved a reli­able de­vel­op­ment part­ner. The Asian eco­nomic gi­ant has since set aside $60 bil­lion to help move for­ward African coun­tries’ de­vel­op­ment agenda in line with the Agenda 2063. This amount in­cludes $35 bil­lion of con­ces­sional loans, $5 bil­lion of grant and zero-in­ter­est loans and an­other $5 bil­lion for the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund and the Spe­cial Loan for the De­vel­op­ment of African small to medium en­ter­prises. The re­main­ing $10 bil­lion will form the China-Africa Fund for Pro­duc­tion Ca­pac­ity Co­op­er­a­tion. China’s co­op­er­a­tion with African coun­tries is part of strength­en­ing South-South co­op­er­a­tion aimed at es­tab­lish­ing a strong bloc of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The Asian coun­try has proved that it is of­fer­ing an al­ter­na­tive to African coun­tries on how they can en­sure they rapidly move to­wards in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. China re­cently formed the Asian In­fras­truc­ture In­vest­ment Bank ( AIIB), which African coun­tries are free to join. The bank is viewed as a game changer in pur­suit of the new de­vel­op­ment model be­ing pur­sued by China. AIIB will con­cen­trate on the de­vel­op­ment of in­fras­truc­ture in mem­ber coun­tries, as a way of strength­en­ing their re­silience in their de­vel­op­ment agen­das.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210219,Iran: An­other nu­clear bun­gle?,"The self-es­teem of two-year-olds and na­tion-states is too frag­ile for them to ad­mit they were wrong, which makes it hard for them to move on from blun­ders. That’s why the toys don’t get picked up and the bro­ken treaties don’t get fixed and why there may be a tantrum (in the case of two-year-olds) or a nu­clear war (in the case of the United States and Iran). The lat­ter contin­gency is im­plau­si­ble, but there is a bi­par­ti­san ef­fort in the US to make it more likely. Un­til a few weeks ago, it was widely be­lieved that a Joe Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would move fast to re­pair the dam­age for­mer pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump did by with­draw­ing from the 2015 treaty in which Iran promised no work on nu­clear weapons for 15 years, but not nec­es­sar­ily so. Why did Trump pull out in the first place? Sheer spite, re­ally. All the world’s in­tel­li­gence agen­cies, in­clud­ing the Amer­i­can ones, agreed that Iran was metic­u­lously obey­ing the terms of the Obama-era treaty, but Trump was sys­tem­at­i­cally de­stroy­ing ev­ery achieve­ment of the “black, for­eign im­poster” who pre­ceded him in the White House. If Obama had granted Amer­i­cans eter­nal life, Trump would have tried to undo it. Iran isn’t even ask­ing for an apol­ogy, al­though it cer­tainly de­serves one. It just wants the US to re­voke the in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions that were ended by the treaty of 2015, but that Trump uni­lat­er­ally re-im­posed, against the wishes of all the other ma­jor pow­ers (Bri­tain, China, France, Ger­many, the Euro­pean Union and Rus­sia), in 2018. That could be done in a day and as soon as it was, promised Iran’s Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhan, Iran would re­turn to com­pli­ance within hours. “Re­turn”, be­cause to mo­ti­vate all the other sig­na­to­ries to press the US to re­turn to the treaty, Iran it­self started a slow-paced se­ries of de­par­tures from the treaty terms in mid-2019. Iran didn’t rush into re­tal­i­a­tion. It waited a year first, telling the Euro­pean pow­ers that it would go on ob­serv­ing the let­ter of the treaty if they al­lowed Ira­nian banks and oil com­pa­nies to go on trad­ing with them. The Euro­peans didn’t dare, know­ing Trump would pun­ish Euro­pean banks and com­pa­nies if they did that, so Iran was left hold­ing the bag. When Iran did start breach­ing the treaty terms, it did so slowly and with plenty of warn­ing, one pro­vi­sion at a time, let­ting the in­spec­tors watch what they were do­ing at ev­ery step: first rais­ing the level of ura­nium en­rich­ment from the treaty-agreed 3,67% to 4,5% in Novem­ber 2019, then go­ing to 5% a year later. How­ever, when the US and Is­rael re­sumed their cam­paign of as­sas­si­na­tions against se­nior Ira­nian mil­i­tary and sci­en­tific per­son­nel last year — Gen­eral Qassem Soleimani in Jan­uary and the coun­try’s top nu­clear sci­en­tist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, in Novem­ber — Iran’s par­lia­ment took a hand. Iran is a par­tially demo­cratic coun­try and the par­lia­ment is cur­rently dom­i­nated by con­ser­va­tives who are fed up with Rouhani’s long pa­tience on this is­sue. Three months ago, they leg­is­lated a se­ries of dead­lines by which Iran would have to breach more se­ri­ous as­pects of the treaty if the US does not re­join it. The first of those dead­lines, when Rouhani’s govern­ment will be obliged to block short-no­tice in­spec­tions by the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency, is only two days away: Fe­bru­ary 21. The Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion could head that off sim­ply by declar­ing that it will re­turn to the treaty with­out con­di­tions, but it ap­pears that the Trump stu­pid­ity is catch­ing. “Will the US lift sanc­tions first in or­der to get Iran back to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble?” CBS News asked Bi­den a fort­night ago. “No,” he replied, and US State Depart­ment spokesman Ned Price later elab­o­rated: “We con­tinue to urge Tehran to re­sume full com­pli­ance with the (nu­clear deal) ... be­cause that, for us, would open up the path­way for diplo­macy.” Trump may be gone, but re­al­ism has not yet found its way back to Wash­ing­ton. When the US breaks a treaty for no good rea­son and plunges tens of mil­lions of Ira­ni­ans into poverty, it is not the victim’s duty to re­scind all its coun­ter­mea­sures first in or­der to prove its good faith. It would be easy to chore­o­graph a dance in which Iran and the US undo this con­fronta­tion step by step in uni­son, thus saving Amer­ica’s face by never men­tion­ing who caused it. But in­sist­ing the Ira­ni­ans move first, as if they were the guilty ones, is a non-starter: they may not be two-yearolds, but they have their pride. They aren’t fully grown-up ei­ther. What Bi­den re­ally must not do is de­mand that Iran make more con­ces­sions be­yond the 2015 treaty be­fore he agrees to end sanc­tions. That was Trump’s game and with all this talk about “open­ing up the path­way for diplo­macy” Bi­den is edg­ing dan­ger­ously close to that.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210205,Call for re­vival of Bu­l­awayo in­dus­try,"CIVIL so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions have called on the gov­ern­ment to for­mu­late a pol­icy aimed at re­viv­ing in­dus­tries in Bu­l­awayo. Zim­babwe’s sec­ond largest city used to be an in­dus­trial hub be­fore a com­bi­na­tion of mal­ad­min­is­tra­tion and cor­rup­tion dur­ing the late for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe’s reign brought it to its knees. Church and Civic So­ci­ety Joint Fo­rum (CCJF) na­tional chair­man Angli­s­tone Sibanda said it was em­bar­rass­ing that Bu­l­awayo’s in­dus­tries were in ru­ins. “The city has been hav­ing acute wa­ter chal­lenges ow­ing to hy­dro pol­i­tics en­graved in the gover­nance sys­tem. Be­cause Bu­l­awayo was anti-Zanu since 1980, Mu­gabe de­vel­oped a pol­icy of what I call strat­i­fied sys­tem­atic marginal­i­sa­tion by cre­at­ing poli­cies and sys­tems that re­sult in un­der­de­vel­op­ment,” Sibanda said. “Bu­l­awayo is a di­rect vic­tim of Mu­gabe’s puni­tive and vin­dic­tive poli­cies. In fact the death of Bu­l­awayo is an eco­nomic ver­sion of Guku­rahundi; it is struc­tural vi­o­lence against the peo­ple of Bu­l­awayo who have over the years re­jected Zanu poli­cies. These poli­cies de­lib­er­ately sought to turn Bu­l­awayo into a con­sumer city, a mar­ket for Harare' goods and ser­vices in or­der to sys­tem­at­i­cally un­der de­velop Mata­bele­land.” Sibanda said the death of Bu­l­awayo can be at­trib­uted to cen­tral­i­sa­tion of gover­nance in Harare mak­ing the cap­i­tal a strate­gic city for busi­ness due to prox­im­ity to de­ci­sion mak­ers. “The fall of the Na­tional Rail­ways of Zim­babwe raised the cost of trans­porta­tion of goods to and from Bu­l­awayo, thereby rais­ing pro­duc­tion costs,” he said. Over 20 000 jobs were lost in Bu­l­awayo dur­ing the 2008 hy­per­in­fla­tion­ary pe­riod. “De-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion saw a huge in­crease in unem­ploy­ment, ex­ac­er­bated poverty and inequal­ity, re­duced the gen­eral stan­dards of liv­ing and qual­ity of life,"" Sibanda said. He said Bu­l­awayo City Coun­cil suf­fers a huge bur­den of un­pro­duc­tive cit­i­zens who are fail­ing to meet their obli­ga­tions re­gard­ing pay­ment of rates, re­sult­ing in the col­lapse of ser­vice de­liv­ery and di­lap­i­da­tion of ba­sic in­fra­struc­ture. ibanda said the col­lapse of Bu­l­awayo also re­sulted in a brain-drain to the neigh­bour­ing coun­tries. “Gov­ern­ment needs to de­volve power and in­vest in the wa­ter pro­vi­sions for the city to ex­pe­dite the com­ple­tion of the Gwayi-Shangani project which will cre­ate an ac­tive agrar­ian sec­tor in Mata­bele­land North, this will cre­ate agro-pro­cess­ing and re­fin­ery in­dus­tries in Bu­l­awayo,” he said. “The di­as­pora par­tic­i­pa­tion is also crit­i­cal. Bu­l­awayo-born peo­ple who have made it in other coun­tries should be mo­ti­vated to in­vest in their home city and cre­ate em­ploy­ment. With the min­ing in­dus­try boom­ing around the city, there are so many op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­vest in, the real es­tate sec­tor is wide open. It will take the Bu­l­awayo cit­i­zens to lead and cham­pion the re­vival of their city in a de­volved gov­ern­ment setup.” Sibanda urged the gov­ern­ment to make a de­lib­er­ate ef­fort to en­gage the peo­ple of Bu­l­awayo to un­lock lo­cal po­ten­tial. Bu­l­awayo Wa­ter Ac­tion Group Co­or­di­na­tor Khum­bu­lani Maphosa said: “The city is not man­u­fac­tur­ing any­thing but im­port­ing ev­ery­thing and any­thing in­clud­ing tooth­picks and that is very wor­ry­ing and em­bar­rass­ing to say the least. If it was in­fla­tion and poor eco­nomic sta­tus of the coun­try, why were some com­pa­nies who only had branches here in Bu­l­awayo re­lo­cat­ing and open­ing some­where in the coun­try.” Maphosa added that Zim­babwe is run on un­just sys­tems of marginal­i­sa­tion and sub­ju­ga­tion, which is why it can't be ex­plained why the Cold Stor­age Com­pany (CSC), G&D, Tim­ber In­dus­tries, NRZ were run down. He de­scribed the whole sce­nario as a psy­cho­log­i­cal war­fare waged against the re­gion. “We need po­lit­i­cal will to con­vert these aban­doned and derelict build­ings into hubs for new in­dus­tries. We are in the 4th in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion of dig­i­tal economies, nan­otech­nolo­gies and the in­ter­net. Our think­ing should also trans­form and see such economies be­ing the new economies of Bu­l­awayo,” Maphosa said. “Yes, we still need other crit­i­cal in­dus­tries be­ing re­vived but it doesn’t mean we need to make them in the same model of 1990. The gov­ern­ment is to blame for the col­lapse of Bu­l­awayo. We should have re­fused to ac­cept de­cay. We should have with­drawn our loy­alty to the Mu­gabe regime but we were too afraid.” Maphosa said the gov­ern­ment must stop con­trol­ling busi­ness but play a fa­cil­i­ta­tor­reg­u­la­tory role. “So we have gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials who are on a self-serv­ing spree and will do any­thing to frus­trate other busi­ness play­ers,” he said. It is es­ti­mated that be­tween 40% and 45% of com­pa­nies re­lo­cated from Bu­l­awayo and about 75% of work­ers lost their jobs through re­trench­ment, com­pany clo­sures, re­lo­ca­tions or down­siz­ing. Last week, the Bu­l­awayo Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone (SEZ) co­or­di­na­tor Kholisani Moyo said the scal­ing down on pro­duc­tion in the city gave rise to the in­flux of im­ported prod­ucts from China, fur­ther shrink­ing the chances of in­dus­tries to be re­vived.

Africa will through the AfCFTA ac­cel­er­ated in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion trans­form African economies into suc­cess sto­ries. The World Bank AfCFTA re­port es­ti­mates a rel­a­tive growth of US$450 bil­lion real in­come in Africa by 2035 with coun­tries like Cote’ Devoire and Zim­babwe set to ben­e­fit more from the full im­ple­men­ta­tion of the AfCFTA. It is im­por­tant to note that the suc­cess of the AfCFTA is not given as it will largely de­pend on the po­lit­i­cal will of State par­ties, the pri­vate sec­tor, civil so­ci­ety and other stake­hold­ers on de­sign­ing con­text spe­cific as well as com­pli­men­tary mea­sures to ef­fec­tively im­ple­ment the AfCFTA. More­over, it is also a given fact that trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion in the short term has neg­a­tive ef­fects on cer­tain businesses es­pe­cially the MSMES and women led businesses. Un­der the lead­er­ship of na­tional Trade Min­istries, the AfCFTA Na­tional Strat­egy Com­mit­tee should adapt the AfCFTA Im­ple­men­ta­tion Ac­tion Plan to re­flect the dy­nam­ics of the ob­tain­ing macro­eco­nomics en­vi­ron­ment as well as the coun­try’s trade per­for­mance such that it will be pos­si­ble to timeously in­ter­vene and mit­i­gate the in­her­ent neg­a­tive ef­fects of trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. The AfCFTA is premised on ex­ist­ing Eco­nomic Re­gional Com­mu­ni­ties, which ac­cord­ing to re­search have strug­gled with im­ple­men­ta­tion gaps. This has been at­trib­uted to lack of po­lit­i­cal will, in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity and lack of ded­i­cated funds. Fur­ther­more, the spaghetti bowl ef­fect may com­pound the im­ple­men­ta­tion process where State Par­ties con­sider the AfCFTA as another ad­di­tion to a layer of trade re­la­tions. On the con­trary, the ex­is­tence of prior agree­ments presents State Par­ties the lever­age of a cer­tain de­gree of au­ton­omy that will add value to the suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of the AfCFTA. The Rules of Ori­gin is a case in point. State Par­ties will be al­lowed to re­vert to the ex­ist­ing rules ob­tain­ing in the RECs should there be chal­lenges on the new AfCFTA Rules of Ori­gin. Glean­ing a leaf from the Sin­ga­pore nar­ra­tion, their suc­cess­ful in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment largely drew from the state in­ter­ven­tion­ist pol­icy that pro­tected cer­tain se­lected sec­tors while di­rect­ing cap­i­tal in­vest­ment to­wards sec­tors that en­hanced in­fra­struc­ture and ed­u­ca­tion to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity. Pro­to­col on Trade in Ser­vices man­dates State Par­ties to seek as­sis­tance from de­vel­op­men­tal part­ners so as to mo­bilise re­sources that will ex­pand ex­port ca­pac­ity as well as en­hance do­mes­tic ac­tiv­i­ties of MSMEs. Nev­er­the­less, through the Pro­to­col on Trade in Goods, na­tional gov­ern­ments are able to in­ter­vene through pol­icy in iden­ti­fy­ing sec­tors that will com­prise the 3 per­cent of ex­cluded goods from tar­iff lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. Re­search within the Re­gional Eco­nomic Com­mu­ni­ties reveals that the voice of businesses re­mains muf­fled or ab­sent in trade ne­go­ti­a­tions with a re­sul­tant dis­con­nect that is detri­men­tal to na­tional eco­nomic growth. The state in­ter­ven­tion­ist pol­icy in the con­text of the AfCFTA will en­list pri­vate sec­tor par­tic­i­pa­tion. Through the var­i­ous cham­bers and Na­tional Trade Fa­cil­i­ta­tion Com­mit­tees, the pri­vate sec­tor should be able to iden­tify bot­tle necks, per­ceive the AfCFTA as an op­por­tu­nity to link with re­gional value chains that will of­fer lo­cal pro­duc­ers ease ac­cess to mar­kets across Africa. Pri­vate sec­tor in­volve­ment will be greatly re­quired in the for­mu­la­tion of stan­dards within the AfCFTA. Stan­dards are de­sir­able for safety, health and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion of the pop­u­la­tion of con­sumers. How­ever, stan­dards can eas­ily be­come tech­ni­cal bar­ri­ers to trade that im­pede seam­less trade. The African Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Stan­dard­i­s­a­tion and Afrex­im­bank have em­barked on the mam­moth task of har­mon­is­ing stan­dards that are frag­mented all over Africa, as with­out this in­ter­ven­tion, suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of the AfCFTA may be a chal­lenge. Im­ple­men­ta­tion of the AfCFTA will re­sult in wel­fare loses and wel­fare gains. In some coun­tries the slow up­take of the AfCFTA by the pri­vate sec­tor has been at­trib­uted to the fear of un­fair com­pe­ti­tion. In­deed trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion comes with op­por­tu­ni­ties of economies of scale, com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage, and com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage and in the process some businesses will close shop due to the cre­ation of ef­fi­cient mar­kets be­cause of the change in the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment. Trans­ship­ments, coun­ter­vail­ing, and dump­ing ac­tiv­i­ties will present con­stant threats how­ever, the AfCFTA has the tools to com­bat un­fair businesses prac­tices that may cause in­jury to the do­mes­tic mar­ket. It will be pos­si­ble to im­pose anti-dump­ing and coun­ter­vail­ing mea­sures on the of­fend­ing goods should the need arise. An as­tute and in­formed pri­vate sec­tor to point out to the Min­istries of Trade any un­fair trade prac­tices will be de­sir­able hence the need for the pri­vate sec­tor, civic so­ci­ety and other stake­hold­ers to thor­oughly fa­mil­iarise with the Africa Con­ti­nent Free Trade Agree­ment and be ac­tive par­tic­i­pants. Fur­ther­more, the AfCFTA On­line Por­tal Non-Tar­iff Bar­ri­ers Re­port­ing Mon­i­tor­ing and Elim­i­na­tion in ad­di­tion to the Africa Union Trade Ob­ser­va­tory will give the traders mech­a­nisms to re­port any un­fair busi­ness prac­tices while gath­er­ing free mar­ket in­tel­li­gence to timeously assess the op­por­tu­ni­ties within the African mar­kets. As part of the first 23 coun­tries that rat­i­fied the AfCFTA, Zim­babwe has to en­sure that the AfCFTA works for the ben­e­fit of all businesses in the coun­try in­clud­ing women owned businesses. While the suc­cess of the AfCFTA is not given, it is how­ever, within the reach of ev­ery State Party through an all-in­clu­sive im­ple­men­ta­tion ap­proach and other tar­geted com­pli­men­tary strate­gies to make it suc­cess­ful. It is now op­por­tune there­fore, for the AfCFTA na­tional strat­egy to be vis­i­ble and ac­ces­si­ble to all stake­hold­ers so as to de­sign an ef­fec­tive roadmap to­wards a suc­cess­ful AfCFTA im­ple­men­ta­tion. ◆ Sit­shengisiwe Ndlovu pres­i­dent of OWITZIMBABWE: MBA/ UNCTAD: Trade and Gen­der Link­ages/ IAC Dip/ Cert: Trade in Ser­vices and SDGs: Robert Schu­man Cen­ter of Ad­vanced Stud­ies/ IDEPCert: Mak­ing the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Agree­ment Work.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190719,In­vestors fall in love with Zim,"SEV­ERAL com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als from across the globe have ex­pressed their in­ter­ests to in­vest in Zim­babwe in line with the mantra, Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness, a lo­cal busi­ness­man has said. The agri­cul­tural sec­tor is at­tract­ing the most in­ter­est. Curechem Over­seas (Pvt) Ltd group manag­ing di­rec­tor Anup Chand, re­vealed this on Wed­nes­day af­ter ar­riv­ing from China where he had been in­vited to make a pre­sen­ta­tion on “Ex­pe­ri­ence in the en­try and chan­nel con­struc­tion in South­ern Africa.” Over 500 del­e­gates from dif­fer­ent coun­tries at­tended the two-day event, which was or­gan­ised by Chi­nese com­pany, Agropages. In an in­ter­view, Mr Chand said his com­pany will con­tinue com­ple­ment­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s thrust to im­prove the econ­omy backed by the mantra “Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness” by com­ing up with var­i­ous ini­tia­tives and mar­ket­ing the coun­try. “I was in­vited by Agropages of China (a lead­ing in­ter­na­tional on­line me­dia in agro­chem­i­cal in­dus­try) to make pre­sen­ta­tion on “Ex­pe­ri­ence in the en­try and Chan­nel con­struc­tion in South­ern Africa. The event was for two days,” he said. “There were more than 500 del­e­gates. I briefed the del­e­gates about op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able in Soth­ern Africa and more par­tic­u­larly in Zim­babwe. They were very impressed and ex­pressed de­sire to do busi­ness. We are al­ready get­ting lot of en­quiries for in­vest­ment in this part of the world,” said Mr Chand. Sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence In his pre­sen­ta­tions, Mr Chand briefed the del­e­gates on busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties in Zim­babwe and the South­ern Africa re­gion, the agro-chem­i­cal mar­ket sit­u­a­tion (back­ground and op­por­tu­ni­ties), the Curechem Group and its strate­gic po­si­tion­ing in the re­gion, pest control meth­ods and fast mov­ing pes­ti­cides, sup­ply chain and key sup­plier of Agro chem­i­cals, and the po­ten­tial tar­get mar­ket size. Mr Chand told the del­e­gates that in­vest­ments in agriculture can make a sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence in the lives of small­holder farm­ers — raising in­comes, re­duc­ing poverty and im­prov­ing food se­cu­rity. “More than two thirds of African ci­ti­zens de­pend on agriculture for their in­comes. Agriculture ac­counts for 33 per­cent of the con­ti­nent’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. “Growth in agriculture sec­tor is 11 times more ef­fec­tive as re­duc­ing poverty in Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa as growth in other sec­tors,” he added. Mr Chand said in Zim­babwe they were also as­sist­ing ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties and im­prov­ing their liveli­hoods through farm­ing projects as part of their so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity. Curechem Over­seas started op­er­a­tions in Zim­babwe in 1998 in Msasa, Harare, with only two em­ploy­ees. Curechem Group is a lead­ing sup­plier of high qual­ity chem­i­cals (agro, min­ing, in­dus­trial and paint) with head of­fice in Jo­han­nes­burg, South Africa.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210305,In­ter­ests and val­ues,"WATCH­ING the changing of the guard in the United States of Amer­ica (USA) from the Don­ald Trump Ad­min­is­tra­tion to the Joe Bi­den era has been fas­ci­nat­ing. On Fri­day, the sec­re­tary of state Antony Blinken stated that the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Saudi King­dom and the USA would be re­con­fig­ured to take into ac­count both the in­ter­ests of the United States and its val­ues. If you think about it, has that not al­ways been the strug­gle in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions? I can re­call when the United Na­tions — through the most pow­er­ful of its agen­cies, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, voted to im­pose manda­tory, in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions on Rhode­sia af­ter its Uni­lat­eral Dec­la­ra­tion of In­de­pen­dence in Novem­ber 1965. This was one of the tough­est sanc­tions regimes ever im­posed on any coun­try in his­tory. It even in­volved a naval block­ade of the Port of Beira. How on earth did that tiny coun­try, with its even smaller white pop­u­la­tion sur­vive? No record re­mains of that era be­cause no one was will­ing to record it and the phys­i­cal records were largely de­stroyed, but in the main, it was in­ter­ests that tilted the bal­ance in favour of the Rhode­sians. The most pow­er­ful State in the world, the USA, broke ranks with the rest of the globe and its al­lies, to get ac­cess to Rhode­sian chrome. Switzer­land to get its beef, Ja­pan its maize, South Africa to se­cure its north­ern bor­der. All act­ing in their own in­ter­ests! Val­ues came se­cond. When Mozam­bique closed its bor­ders with Rhode­sia in 1975, it was the Rus­sians who bought the mil­lions of dol­lars’ worth of Rhode­sian ex­ports caught in Mozam­bique Ports. Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the slo­gan was “Amer­ica first”. So they im­posed re­stric­tions on US/China trade with mas­sive new tar­iffs, they threw out the Paris Agree­ment to al­low the con­tin­ued use of coal and the ex­plo­ration for gas and oil. They urged Amer­i­can com­pa­nies to buy Amer­i­can and to stop re­lo­cat­ing pro­duc­tion abroad. Self-in­ter­est ruled the day. Noth­ing new about these sen­ti­ments — we hear them ex­pressed all the time, all over the world. Of­ten they are pop­u­lar and even win elec­tions, but the con­se­quences are of­ten not what was planned or ex­pected. If we go back in his­tory to the era when Bri­tain ruled one third of the world un­der its Em­pire man­tle, there was no doubt about their in­ter­ests — they ruled supreme. Partly be­cause they thought they were su­pe­rior to ev­ery­one else and partly be­cause that was how the “real” world worked. Trade flowed out from Bri­tain and across the globe, bring­ing raw ma­te­ri­als and the wealth cre­ated in many coun­tries to the shores of Bri­tain. Bri­tain grew wealthy and pow­er­ful on the backs of oth­ers. His­tory clearly shows the great loot­ing of In­dia dur­ing colo­nial oc­cu­pa­tion. Por­tu­gal did the same in the Far East and in Africa, Spain in the Amer­i­cas. When I met Samora Machel once in Ma­puto, af­ter he be­came the Pres­i­dent of Mozam­bique, he re­marked to me, “Mr. Cross, if you were to be able to choose to be colonised, you would never have cho­sen to be colonised by the Por­tuguese”. I think he was right. Just look at the ex­am­ple of Bel­gium in the Congo basin. A good de­scrip­tion might be an era of rape and pil­lage. The in­ter­ests of those who were colonised sel­dom took cen­tre stage. An in­ter­est­ing fea­ture of the Boer War and the Rhode­sian UDI was that they rep­re­sented re­bel­lions against the colo­nial dom­i­na­tion of Bri­tain. In many re­spects the Boer War was the first lib­er­a­tion strug­gle in Africa. Of course all that did was to move the cen­tre of in­ter­ests to the lo­cal oc­cu­pants of the colo­nial seat. In their turn the white Rhode­sians and the Afrikan­ers saw them­selves as de­fend­ers of their own nar­row in­ter­ests. Val­ues al­ways played a sec­ondary role. So where do the “val­ues” come in? If you think through this is­sue very care­fully, the first ques­tion is where do these “val­ues” come from? In primeval jun­gles, in­ter­ests come first. In the cave, the strong­est ruled. If mankind is a prod­uct of evo­lu­tion as the world might want us to be­lieve, then are there any “fun­da­men­tals” to guide pol­icy? The short an­swer is no, never has been. So where do these val­ues, come from? I am a Chris­tian and make no apolo­gies for that. When I read my Bi­ble I dis­cover the “val­ues” that seem to be the ba­sis of what the US ad­min­is­tra­tion refers to and which seem to guide hu­man­ity as it seeks to gov­ern it­self. In Gen­e­sis, there are many rev­o­lu­tion­ary ideas, which could never have “evolved”. • The idea of mankind rul­ing the world, of man­ag­ing all of cre­ation for its own ben­e­fit! • The con­cept of cus­to­di­an­ship and be­ing re­spon­si­ble for the wel­fare of all cre­ation and not just our own in­ter­ests — are all there. • The idea that men and women share re­spon­si­bil­ity for government, com­pletely rev­o­lu­tion­ary and in sharp con­tra­dic­tion to the dominance of the strong over the weak! • The cre­ation of the fam­ily, its struc­ture and the roles given to men and women and chil­dren, ac­cepted by all so­ci­eties yet alien to the “nat­u­ral or­der of things”. All Bi­b­li­cal in ori­gin! Then the teach­ings of Christ — do unto oth­ers as you would want oth­ers to do for you. The “great com­mand­ments” — love God and your neigh­bours. In the sav­age king­dom, such sen­ti­ments are to­tally alien, ask Shaka Zulu! Hu­man rights have no ba­sis out­side of bi­b­li­cal teach­ing and prin­ci­ples, if we are an­i­mals why as­cribe spe­cial rights to our species and not oth­ers? I can re­call hav­ing a con­ver­sa­tion with my grand­fa­ther who was an as­so­ciate of Jan Smuts and a prom­i­nent South African, where he said to me, af­ter the Afrikan­ers had taken power in 1949 and launched the pol­icy of Apartheid which was to dom­i­nate the next 45 years of South African his­tory; “some­day the Afrikan­ers are go­ing to dis­cover that Apartheid is against their own val­ues as a Chris­tian peo­ple and when they do they will put it right”. That hap­pened much later when the Head of the Re­formed Church of South Africa ad­mit­ted to a meet­ing of African Chris­tian lead­ers in Kenya that Apartheid had been wrong. In the end it was not sanc­tions or force that cowed the Afrikaner peo­ple, it was prin­ci­ple and when that hap­pened, change and re­form was the re­sult, with­out vi­o­lence. When Chris­tian re­vivals swept through Bri­tain, it was the new Chris­tians who led the strug­gle against slav­ery and ex­ploita­tion. It was the Chris­tian Church who reached out to the World and brought ed­u­ca­tion and health ser­vices to the mil­lions who lived in dark places with­out hope. Of­ten find­ing them­selves pit­ted against the colo­nial au­thor­i­ties who gov­erned the peo­ple they had come to serve. It was per­se­cuted Euro­pean Chris­tians who mi­grated to the USA and crafted the Con­sti­tu­tion they so fiercely de­fend to­day and which lim­ited the power of Government and im­posed the sep­a­ra­tion of pow­ers on those in au­thor­ity. It was the Chris­tians who led the strug­gle for equal rights and an end to racist poli­cies im­posed by the whites “in their in­ter­ests”. These things do not come nat­u­rally to mankind; they are ideas to be adopted be­cause in some mysterious way they are fun­da­men­tal truths handed down to us. It will be in­ter­est­ing to see how US val­ues are in­ter­preted into a new dis­pen­sa­tion in the USA. US com­mit­ment to free trade and pri­vate en­ter­prise and mar­ket-driven eco­nomics has in many re­spects changed the world we live in. In the process, these poli­cies have en­abled many coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, to lift their peo­ple out of poverty and hunger. Have the Amer­i­can peo­ple suf­fered as a re­sult, I would ar­gue no, a ris­ing tide lifts all boats! What a dif­fer­ence it would make if we all sought to gov­ern un­der God and work only for the wel­fare of oth­ers.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201219,China’s un­der-30s en­trepreneurs,"Ms G WHEN it comes to good busi­ness ideas, age and ex­pe­ri­ence seem less im­por­tant than we would have thought. In China, the 20-some­things are mak­ing a foray into the busi­ness world. Ac­cord­ing to a 2019 sur­vey of the un­der-30s’, Chi­nese en­trepreneurs work­ing in the In­ter­net field, 45,16 per­cent started their first busi­ness pro­gramme be­fore they turned 22. The teams be­hind them are equally young — in 70,97 per­cent of the com­pa­nies, the em­ploy­ees mainly aged be­tween 18 and 25; those in their 30s ac­counted for a mere 3,23 per­cent. Their suc­cess is re­mark­able. Wang Rui, a 30-year-old, started an online plat­form a few years ago for col­lege stu­dents to look for part time jobs when he him­self was a stu­dent. To­day, he has 26 mil­lion users in 283 cities in the coun­try; every year, an av­er­age of 100 mil­lion matches are made; his start-up is now val­ued at nearly one bil­lion RMB (about 151 mil­lion US dol­lars). In 2014, as a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of stu­dent en­trepreneurs, he joined a meet­ing with the coun­try’s pre­mier to pro­vide in­put into China’s an­nual govern­ment work re­port. In the gath­er­ing of China’s top busi­ness lead­ers, Wang stood out as the youngest, barely 22 years old. Li Guochen, a 26-year-old, be­gan his busi­ness ad­ven­tures in high school, mak­ing his first for­tune selling elec­tronic prod­ucts. In col­lege, he cre­ated an app to pro­vide ser­vices for life on cam­pus, such as take­out or­der­ing and de­liv­er­ing, apartment rent­ing, car hir­ing, and en­ter­tain­ment. Only one year into op­er­a­tion, the to­tal rev­enue topped 12 mil­lion RMB (1,8 mil­lion US dol­lars). While e-com­merce is where most ideas take off, some young en­trepreneurs are also mak­ing it work in the agro-pro­cess­ing sec­tor. At the 8th China Busi­ness In­no­va­tion Con­fer­ence held last week in Bei­jing, Kang Jian was one of the most eye-catch­ing at­ten­dants. Dressed in tra­di­tional cos­tume to high­light his eth­nic mi­nor­ity back­ground, the un­der30 young man was there to present his 10 mil­lion RMB- worth of biotech com­pany that makes green tea out of a tra­di­tional herb in his home­town. For hun­dreds of years, worm­wood bud has been part of the diet of the Da­woer eth­nic group in north-east­ern China where Kang calls home. It is nor­mally seen in soup, stew and dumpling fill­ings. In the old days, th­ese eas­ily found herbs filled up the food gap for the Da­wo­ers. In re­cent years, as the Da­wo­ers join the rest of the coun­try in food se­cu­rity, the nu­tri­tional and medic­i­nal ef­fects of worm­wood bud is catch­ing the in­ter­est of the healthy eaters. This shift gave Kang ideas. A pro­fes­sion­ally trained tea spe­cial­ist, he de­vel­oped a green tea prod­uct from worm­wood bud which proved im­mensely pop­u­lar. But to Da­wo­ers like Kang, worm­wood is more than just a herb. The small but re­silient plant car­ries the cul­ture and his­tory of the eth­nic group. This is also what Kang wants his cus­tomers to know. He de­signed stores to of­fer a cul­tural ex­pe­ri­ence and tell the story of the herb, his com­pany, and his peo­ple. The move proved a win-win for his tea and his cul­ture. Kang’s com­pany has cre­ated over 1 000 lo­cal jobs and greatly in­creased the in­comes of worm­wood farm­ers. “I don’t think we are ed­u­cated in or­der to leave our poor home­town. We are ed­u­cated to lift our town out of poverty,”Kang was clear about his choice. In the un­der-30s en­trepreneurs like him, we see the fu­ture of an ever-grow­ing na­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200823,Africa’s chance to dic­tate its own terms,"THERE are grow­ing signs that the aid re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Global South and the Global North is chang­ing fast. Many tra­di­tional Western donors are re-eval­u­at­ing the role of aid while keep­ing a close eye on their own na­tional in­ter­ests. These changes may not be all bad. Since the turn of the cen­tury, aid poli­cies have be­come both com­plex and frag­mented. Four ma­jor in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment poli­cies and goal-set­ting projects were launched in 2015 alone. These are the Paris Agree­ment, the Ad­dis Ababa Ac­tion Agenda on Fi­nanc­ing for De­vel­op­ment, the Sendai Frame­work for Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion and the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. The global de­vel­op­ment agenda now in­cludes mul­ti­ple goals on poverty re­duc­tion, eco­nomic growth, the en­vi­ron­ment and cli­mate change. This un­prece­dented in­ter­na­tional pol­icy over­load is rad­i­cally al­ter­ing the aid land­scape. As the world’s most de­vel­oped coun­tries craft a new nar­ra­tive that more strongly links aid to cli­mate change and hu­man­i­tar­ian crises, African coun­tries can tip the bal­ance in their favour. This can pro­vide an op­por­tu­nity to shape the fu­ture of North-South re­la­tions. Less talk of rich-poor coun­try There has been less talk of the rich­poor di­chotomy since the in­tro­duc­tion of the am­bi­tious Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals ( SDGs) in 2015. In­deed, the de­vel­op­ment goals have strength­ened the nar­ra­tive that the re­spon­si­bil­ity for achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment ap­plies to all coun­tries. Al­though each coun­try may face dis­tinct chal­lenges, the in­ter-con­nect­ed­ness of global progress means that we are all in the same boat. Many African coun­tries have en­gaged in South-South co­op­er­a­tion with ma­jor pow­ers like China and In­dia. In build­ing large in­fra­struc­ture projects, China high­lights its im­pres­sive achieve­ments in lift­ing over half a bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty. In­dia show­cases the suc­cesses of its green revo­lu­tion and ad­vances in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy and af­ford­able health­care. Both coun­tries also flaunt their abil­ity to de­velop af­ford­able, avail­able and adapt­able tech­nol­ogy and their es­tab­lished track record of solv­ing devel­op­men­tal chal­lenges. With the grow­ing global eco­nomic power and in­flu­ence of China, In­dia and other mid­dle-in­come coun­tries, de­vel­op­ment diplo­macy is be­ing re­con­sti­tuted. The UK has of­ten in the past shown a soft spot for its former colonies and been hailed as a gen­er­ous and innovative global leader. But it is now also openly tout­ing the na­tional in­ter­est. The UK-Africa Sum­mit held in Jan­uary 2020 was an at­tempt to ad­vance new ini­tia­tives and com­mer­cial part­ner­ships with the con­ti­nent. And there is con­sid­er­able un­cer­tainty on the ex­tent to which Nordic gen­eros­ity of ty­ing aid with “soft power” is com­pat­i­ble with main­tain­ing a well-funded wel­fare state and achiev­ing pol­icy co­her­ence on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The cli­mate cri­sis has made it abun­dantly clear that the oil pro­duc­ing and gen­er­ous aid providers like Nor­way can­not “lead” the global de­vel­op­ment agenda with­out un­der­tak­ing bold ini­tia­tives at home. It is not just the West but also other ac­tors that are show­ing in­ter­est in Africa. Rus­sia has launched a ma­jor strat­egy to open “a new page” and make the whole con­ti­nent a for­eign pol­icy pri­or­ity. Africa is thus at­tract­ing re­newed global in­ter­est and ri­valry among world pow­ers. Some even warn of a “new scram­ble for Africa in­volv­ing ma­jor and emerg­ing pow­ers who are all vy­ing for the con­ti­nent’s at­ten­tion. Al­though aid flows may de­crease over time, there is now more in­ter­est in boost­ing trade and in­vest­ments. The key ques­tion for us is how African coun­tries can use this grow­ing in­ter­est to their ad­van­tage. Three ma­jor chal­lenges We iden­tify three broad sets of con­cerns as African states be­come en­tan­gled in new and re­ju­ve­nated re­la­tion­ships with ma­jor world pow­ers. The first re­lates to fears of ris­ing debt. In­ter­na­tional schol­ars and or­gan­i­sa­tions have ar­gued that a re­newed com­mit­ment to debt re­lief should be a top pri­or­ity for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Con­ces­sional loans and for­eign ex­per­tise have been used to build ex­pen­sive in­fra­struc­ture projects that African coun­tries can­not af­ford. Re­cent po­lit­i­cal de­bates in Zam­bia and Nige­ria il­lus­trate the grow­ing con­cern over re­pay­ing debts to China. There are also con­cerns over the en­vi­ron­men­tal and fi­nan­cial costs of Rus­sian ac­tiv­i­ties on the con­ti­nent. The will­ing­ness of Western pow­ers to pro­vide debt re­lief is also un­der ques­tion. The sec­ond re­lates to the in­creas­ingly tense US-China re­la­tions. Paired with this is the lack of com­mit­ment to demo­cratic prin­ci­ples in some of the coun­tries that are seek­ing closer ties with Africa. The Global North be­lieves that the ac­tiv­i­ties of China, Rus­sia and oth­ers will weaken ef­forts to pro­mote and strengthen good gov­er­nance and lib­eral val­ues. An il­lus­tra­tive ex­am­ple is the feud be­tween Rus­sia and China on the one hand and the African group of three within the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. While the three – Côte d’Ivoire, Equa­to­rial Guinea and South Africa – sought a strong coun­cil back­ing for civil­ian rule fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir’s ouster in April 2019 the two per­ma­nent mem­bers de­murred. Kenya has shown that it can take a tough stance against both the China. It re­cently re­buffed US ef­forts to boy­cott Huawei and high­lighted the poor qual­ity of med­i­cal equip­ment it had im­ported from China. A third area of con­cern is greater un­cer­tainty on the ben­e­fits of con­tin­ued glob­al­i­sa­tion. The po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in the US and parts of Europe has strength­ened the voice of those ar­gu­ing for the pri­macy of the na­tional in­ter­est in po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion-mak­ing. One ev­i­dent re­sult has been the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­duced sup­port for mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions. An­other is the 20 per­cent cut in the UK’s aid bud­get. The wave of refugees into Europe in 2015 also con­trib­uted to an in­ward-look­ing men­tal­ity in many coun­tries. The re­sult was a re­al­lo­ca­tion of aid bud­gets to cover in-donor costs of hous­ing refugees. There was also more ex­plicit align­ment of aid with na­tional in­ter­ests such as com­mer­cial and se­cu­rity con­cerns. How African lead­ers ad­dress these three over­ar­ch­ing sets of con­cerns will greatly de­ter­mine the fu­ture avail­abil­ity of de­vel­op­ment fi­nance on the con­ti­nent. US Rene­go­ti­ate the terms A more ex­plicit em­pha­sis on the na­tional in­ter­est may en­cour­age donor coun­tries to play “the long game” in Africa. Am­bi­tious for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties and innovative de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes may even achieve cross-po­lit­i­cal sup­port from tax­pay­ers in parts of Europe where aid pol­icy is con­tentious. But in­creased em­pha­sis on the na­tional in­ter­est also ex­poses the seem­ingly al­tru­is­tic “donor-re­cip­i­ent” re­la­tion­ship. Court­ing closer ties with Africa will not sim­ply be about bring­ing gifts, but also ex­pect­ing rec­i­proc­ity in some form. But Western cri­tiques of Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will ring hol­low in the ab­sence of vi­able and state-led al­ter­na­tives from the West. His­tor­i­cally, many African states have had to ac­cept the pol­icy con­di­tion­al­ity of donor al­liances. There is now a unique op­por­tu­nity to de­mand what Africa needs. This is the mo­ment to play ex­ter­nal ac­tors off against each other. The con­ti­nent’s ma­jor economies must also take steps to en­able smaller coun­tries to be more as­sertive. With a di­verse field of com­pet­ing world pow­ers in­volved, and in as­sert­ing its own de­vel­op­ment vi­sion, African unity and co­or­di­na­tion is of ut­most im­por­tance.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210116,"No per­ma­nent friends, but in­ter­ests: Zim­babwe-China re­la­tion ex­pe­di­tion","LATE 2020, China and Zim­babwe launched five-year poli­cies to­wards the re­al­i­sa­tion of vi­sion 2030, sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals. Zim­babwe be­ing an ally to China, one can ques­tion if this was due to diplo­matic es­pi­onage, de­vel­op­men­tal ex­per­i­ment (com­pe­ti­tion), China ex­tend­ing its con­trol over Zim­babwe through what some may call the new “an­nex­a­tion” of Zim­babwe or gen­er­ally co­in­ci­dence. De­vel­op­ment is a multi-di­men­sional process in­volv­ing changes in so­cial struc­ture, pop­u­lar at­ti­tudes, eco­nomic growth, and re­duc­tion of in­equal­ity and erad­i­ca­tion of poverty — To­daro and Smith. From this def­i­ni­tion, there is need to un­der­stand if the re­la­tion, in­deed, brings de­vel­op­ment to Zim­babwe pay­ing at­ten­tion also to the two poli­cies, as Zim­babwe’s fu­ture is at stake. Look­ing back, the Chi­nese were yearn­ing for nat­u­ral re­sources and raw ma­te­ri­als, while Zim­babwe was stum­bling with in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, which then led to the Look East Pol­icy ty­ing the two eco­nom­i­cally although the his­tory can be traced back to the pre­colo­nial era. If the re­sources are de­pleted, will the re­la­tion­ship re­main still? The late for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe once at­tacked China over how much de­vel­op­ment it was bring­ing to Zim­babwe, as what it was giv­ing was not com­men­su­rate with what it was tak­ing back home. Although his suc­ces­sor Emmerson Mnan­gagwa seems to be in good books with the Chi­nese, there is still con­fu­sion with the peo­ple ques­tion­ing the fu­ture of Zim­babwe. This is be­cause ref­er­enc­ing with the ac­tive years of Chi­nese in Zim­babwe, there has been less de­vel­op­ment as de­sired, as the coun­try’s eco­nomic for­tunes are still in the dol­drums. Na­tional de­vel­op­ment strat­egy is closely in­ter­linked with China’s 14th fiveyear plan, tak­ing note of the re­al­i­sa­tion of vi­sion 2030. The Chi­nese as the main in­vestors in Zim­babwe, na­tional pri­or­i­ties were highly-cen­tred on them which in turn to some ex­tent block other in­vestors. Typ­i­cal ex­am­ples could be the food se­cu­rity and nu­tri­tion which is sup­ported by Chi­nese agri­cul­tural pro­grammes, pro­moted by Syn­genta, although we have our own State-funded Pfumvudza pro­gramme aid­ing on. Dig­i­tal econ­omy is also in syn­chro­ni­sa­tion with the Chi­nese fo­cus on cryp­tocur­rency and dig­i­tal trade rules. Zim­babwe also aims at pro­tect­ing en­vi­ron­ment and China turn to aid on tech­nolo­gies re­ly­ing on MIC 2025. It can­not be re­futed that most of NDS pri­or­i­ties are re­ly­ing on China and it will pave way for en­slave­ment at large, although the na­tion is set to en­gage and re-en­gage in­ter­na­tion­ally. Digging deep, China’s five-year pol­icy and Zim­babwe’s NDS have a com­mon strat­a­gem to­wards the re­al­i­sa­tion of 2030 SDGs. This can im­prove the dual re­la­tion­ship if the two work closely to­gether as com­pet­i­tive coun­ter­parts as a new de­vel­op­men­tal strat­egy. But, how­ever, the op­po­site is true as one State will al­ways pur­sue its na­tional in­ter­ests, lead­ing to dom­i­nance and cre­ation of de­pen­dency syn­drome with less cor­dial rec­i­proc­ity. China’s five-year plan fo­cuses on ex­pand­ing its for­eign ex­per­tise so as to se­cure its sup­ply fet­ters and Zim­babwe is prone to that. China be­ing the so-called big in­vestor of Zim­babwe its be­hav­iour hasn’t been paid much at­ten­tion as the re­la­tion­ship is like a sink­ing cargo ship been loaded for a trip. This is be­cause the fu­ture China has less to do in im­prov­ing other na­tions and hence de­pend­ing on them is never to bring joy for the fu­ture gen­er­a­tion. In April 2020, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pro­pounded ad­van­ta­geous use of “China’s pull mar­ket to at­tract global re­sources and deepen global de­pen­dence on China”. Hence, the trust of Zim­babwe to de­velop un­der Chi­nese al­liance be­came moot, pay­ing at­ten­tion to the prin­ci­ples of mod­erni­sa­tion the­ory as pro­pounded by Walt W Ros­tow. Be­sides de­pend­ing on China, Zim­babwe could be rich if it makes use of its vast re­sources which are be­ing ex­ploited by the Chi­nese. Zim­babwe can be in a place to pro­mote resur­gence of gold stan­dard to im­prove the eco­nomic power of the na­tion, but in turn, we Zim­bab­weans have cre­ated and made use of fiat money, which is now caus­ing and serv­ing as a block­ade to for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment and to a larger ex­tent, the econ­omy will stum­ble as it is right now and can be traced from the day the na­tion in­tro­duced the use of bond notes ahead of the more stable United States dol­lar. The gov­ern­ment al­ways hide with sanc­tions, nat­u­ral dis­as­ters and now is the COVID-19 pan­demic, pay­ing a blind eye on the Chi­nese par­a­sitic be­hav­iour and, thus, be­comes a mat­ter of pol­i­tics over eco­nomics (who gets what, when and how — H Laswell). A good ex­am­ple of de­vel­op­men­tal ex­per­i­ment can be ex­port-led traced from the Asian tigers. Closer to home we have the African lions and Rwanda serv­ing as a typ­i­cal ex­am­ple with ex­tra­or­di­nary poli­cies be­ing in­tro­duced to im­prove the econ­omy of the state. South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity or Africa at large should unite and fur­ther the ideas of great lead­ers like Kwame Nkrumah and Muam­mar Gaddafi of Pan-African­ism and United Africa so as to African­ise de­vel­op­ment and ap­plaud African Union like the Euro­pean Union has been done over the past years for serv­ing its man­dated ob­jec­tives. An im­prove­ment is noted with the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area tak­ing strides giv­ing hope to de­vel­op­ing so­ci­eties. Chi­nese pres­ence in Africa is ex­pand­ing and some may ar­gue that this is due to less at­ten­tion on the prin­ci­ples of World Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion and that fact can­not be de­nied. Over an abysmal look on the trade re­la­tions, equal­ity as the para­mount fea­ture is highly de­bat­able. This is be­cause prin­ci­ples of Most Favoured Na­tion and Na­tional treat­ment are be­ing ob­served gen­er­ally as de­vel­op­ing states lack ca­pac­ity and other bet­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties lead­ing to one side look. Chi­nese not ob­serv­ing the prin­ci­ple of anti-dump­ing for in­stance as Africa has high sub­stan­dard prod­ucts from China, he paving a way for China as ro­bust trad­ing na­tion. There is need to en­gage and recre­ate re­la­tions with other na­tions so as to cre­ate com­pet­i­tive en­vi­ron­ment for both de­vel­op­ment and in­vest­ment, by such the Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness mantra can be ap­plauded as a noble move by the pres­i­dent. Even if one notes China as a good friend, it can­not be rubbed off that soon or later the re­la­tion­ship will get sour as in­ter­ests mu­tates ce­ment­ing cri­sis and Novem­ber 2017 serve as an ex­am­ple when the cit­i­zens were singing “...

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190804,Time to wean our­selves from aid de­pen­dence,"WILL the “Bri­tish Trump” take a soft line to­wards Zim­babwe or will he push the same old agenda? Will he in­flu­ence the Amer­i­can Trump to take a sim­i­lar stance to­wards our na­tion? The rea­son why we are so keenly in­ter­ested is be­cause we will have to live with the re­sult of what­ever de­ci­sions John­son takes. We will feel the im­pact in our daily lives. Which is a rather un­happy and dan­ger­ous state for an al­legedly sov­er­eign na­tion: to be de­pen­dent on the whims of lead­ers of coun­tries that are a mil­lion miles away ge­o­graph­i­cally, so­cially, eco­nom­i­cally and cul­tur­ally; to be at the mercy of priv­i­leged white males who have no clue what it means to be a black Zim­bab­wean, or any other African. I be­lieve that hav­ing al­ready suf­fered the pain of cen­sure by the West­ern pow­ers, Zim­babwe is in a unique space to make his­tory. In­stead of con­tin­u­ing to look for ap­pro­ba­tion and suc­cour from our erst­while colo­nial mas­ters in the form of aid, we should be shak­ing off the yoke of de­pen­dence. Not that I am ad­vo­cat­ing that we aban­don the re-en­gage­ment drive. Far from it. But we need to re­move the “beg­gar” tag when we go to the ne­go­ti­at­ing table. As long as we en­gage as the poor cousins pray­ing for aid, there will be no progress in our na­tion. Although the jury is still out on whether aid has harmed or ben­e­fited Africa, there are fig­ures that do not lie. In spite of bil­lions re­port­edly spent by the West on aid in Africa, the con­ti­nent re­mains an un­der­de­vel­oped con­ti­nent by all stan­dard mark­ers. Pos­si­bly be­cause a huge chunk of the “aid” is re­ally used to spon­sor war­fare. And the amount that is pushed to­wards hu­man­i­tar­ian and de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes is fur­ther sig­nif­i­cantly re­duced through salaries and al­lowances for for­eign aid work­ers. We can quib­ble about the how and why aid has not up­lifted Africa into a de­vel­oped con­ti­nent, but that bot­tom line will not change. The African con­ti­nent will not rise on the back of aid. No na­tion can force de­vel­op­ment on an­other. With an in­creas­ingly young pop­u­la­tion, Zim­babwe and the rest of Africa have to ur­gently turn to­wards sus­tain­able lega­cies. This is so im­por­tant that the World Bank has ded­i­cated a 24-hour “Econothon” — marathon talks on eco­nom­ics — to dis­cuss Africa’s young pop­u­la­tion. In Zim­babwe, we are al­ready see­ing over­whelm­ing pres­sure on ba­sics such as health de­liv­ery, ed­u­ca­tion, shel­ter and food. What will it look like in the next decade when the pop­u­la­tion hits 30 mil­lion if cur­rent lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment are not dealt with? Ear­lier this year, or­gan­i­sa­tions like FAO es­ti­mated that ap­prox­i­mately 2,4 mil­lion peo­ple, mak­ing up about 28 per­cent of the ru­ral Zim­babwe pop­u­la­tion, would have be­come se­verely food in­se­cure by March 2019, with fig­ures ex­pected to rise as the year pro­gresses. This is some­thing that is quite com­mon in Zim­babwe and Africa as a whole since most na­tions con­tinue to rely on rain-fed agri­cul­ture. The an­swer has been to wait for the big white saviour in the form of or­gan­i­sa­tions like USAID to move in with food aid. This is tan­ta­mount to the State in­sti­tu­tion­al­is­ing de­pen­dency on donors for the sur­vival of cer­tain de­mo­graphic groups. That is not ac­cept­able and we can­not con­tinue to pre­tend that the coun­try will de­velop with such a mind­set in­form­ing our poli­cies. Which is where China comes into the equa­tion. China is now the world fi­nan­cial pow­er­house to watch. China has turned to Africa as a po­ten­tial part­ner in chang­ing the bal­ance of power to cre­ate more eq­ui­table space for the global south on the world stage. Does the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) pro­vide a re­al­is­tic op­tion for Zim­babwe and other African coun­tries to take con­trol of their own des­tinies and write the fu­ture his­tory that they de­sire? Can the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive drive Africa to de­vel­oped world sta­tus? An­nounc­ing the lat­est US$60 bil­lion three-year Focac pack­age for Africa, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said that Chi­nese funds are not for “van­ity projects” in Africa. “In­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture is be­lieved to be the big­gest bot­tle­neck to Africa’s de­vel­op­ment,” he said. Thus, Focac fund­ing should not be viewed as a panacea for all of Africa’s ills, but a vi­able op­tion to the West­ern aid and debt-trap model. There are lessons to be learnt from China’s story. Sta­tis­tics say be­tween 1981 and 2013, China lifted 850 mil­lion of its ci­ti­zens out of poverty, with the per­cent­age of peo­ple liv­ing in ex­treme poverty fall­ing from 88 per­cent to 1,85 per­cent of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion. But that suc­cess story will not be du­pli­cated in Zim­babwe or any other African coun­try with­out con­cise ac­tion plans. This was no fluke, but the re­sult of con­cise plans and im­ple­men­ta­tion. Poverty re­duc­tion pro­grammes in China are not for­eign-aid-driven ini­tia­tives de­signed in some West­ern city. They are vil­lage-based, with gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials shoul­der­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity through strong mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion sys­tems where re­sults can­not be fudged to re­flect false and su­per­fi­cial suc­cess in re­ports for re­mote donors. We need to iden­tify the in­fra­struc­ture projects which will have high im­pact. We have a lot of po­ten­tial in our agri­cul­ture sec­tor and that is the back­bone that should drive all other con­sid­er­a­tions. Our land laws and poli­cies need to be made more in­vestor-friendly with­out mort­gag­ing the coun­try afresh. Who­ever we are turn­ing to for part­ner­ship in our de­vel­op­ment, the drive for de­vel­op­ment has to start with us. It is only our dreams and as­pi­ra­tions turned into ac­tion that can pro­pel us to cre­ate the coun­try that our own baby boomers can live in with dig­nity. We can­not con­tinue depend­ing on white males in dis­tant lands that have never been to Zim­babwe to take pity on us.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210113,Se­cu­rity in a time of tu­mult,"ONCE more, we are am­bushed by the world we live in and on which we all de­pend for a liv­ing and any kind of a fu­ture. This time it is not a dic­ta­tor or a false ide­ol­ogy, it is not war or a threat of global an­ni­hi­la­tion from a nu­clear con­flict. It is the near to­tal dis­lo­ca­tion of our way of life caused by a tiny virus we can­not see. A virus, so frag­ile, it can­not stand wa­ter and soap. If ever we needed a re­minder of the fragility of life and of our care­fully fab­ri­cated sys­tems to give us se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity, this is it! It swept the world af­ter its emer­gence in China, no pass­port con­trols, oceans or fences. When it hit us we mo­bilised our re­sources, hu­man and po­lit­i­cal, all to no avail. When this havoc is over, ev­ery­one will have been touched by its fa­tal em­brace or af­fected by its im­pact on our economies and our so­ci­ety. The United States of Amer­ica, spent US$5 tril­lion on its health and eco­nomic chal­lenges in this process US$14 000 for ev­ery man, woman and ev­ery child. Still it was un­able to halt 10% of all adult Amer­i­cans los­ing their jobs and be­ing at the mercy of the State for sus­te­nance. At the other end of the spec­trum, In­dia saw tens of mil­lions of the ab­so­lute poor lose their jobs or op­por­tu­nity and forced back to their vil­lages to sur­vive. No one es­caped the on­slaught — even the wealth of the Gulf could not pro­tect Dubai which now sits silent and empty and is go­ing broke. Just think about our pil­lars of safety and se­cu­rity: Nato: Cre­ated in the af­ter­math of the Sec­ond World War and dur­ing the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Nato is the most pow­er­ful mil­i­tary al­liance ever cre­ated and has led the way in not only en­sur­ing that the con­flict be­tween the his­tor­i­cal an­tag­o­nists of Europe never takes place again, but also en­sur­ing that Soviet and Chi­nese pow­ers, cre­ated on the back of their en­slaved pop­u­la­tions, are un­able or un­will­ing to take the risk of cross-bor­der in­cur­sions. The mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions: Also the prod­uct of post war lead­er­ship and crafted at a time fi­nan­cial col­lapse and the cost of re­build­ing Europe and Ja­pan threat­ened to desta­bilise the world. Since then th­ese in­sti­tu­tions have over­seen the con­tin­ued sta­bil­ity of the world we live in. Many of us have no idea of how they have con­trib­uted or their im­pact on our in­di­vid­ual lives, but in many ways th­ese have played a key role in the new world order. The United Na­tions: Most peo­ple have no idea that it was an Afrikaner who played a key role in the Boer War at the turn of the 20th Cen­tury, who en­vis­aged a new global in­sti­tu­tion rep­re­sent­ing all coun­tries and ca­pa­ble of me­di­at­ing in global and con­ti­nen­tal con­flict. Jan Smuts not only en­vis­aged the new in­sti­tu­tion but crafted its first man­date and char­ter. When this fore­run­ner in­sti­tu­tion col­lapsed it was re­placed by the United Na­tions which has sur­vived in the past 70 years de­spite its many crit­ics and the an­tics of some in­ter­na­tional lead­ers. No one ques­tioned its role to­day — just its ef­fec­tive­ness, but we are more sta­ble and at peace than ever, be­cause of th­ese in­sti­tu­tions. The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion: If I was to iden­tify any one in­sti­tu­tion that has done more to al­le­vi­ate global poverty and to drive the great­est and most sus­tained boom in his­tory, it is the WTO and its as­so­ci­ated free trade agents. We may fear the new mar­ket power of China and the other east­ern tiger States, but there can be no doubt that free trade has done more to bring pros­per­ity of sorts to bil­lions and to have up­lifted coun­tries which just 75 years ago were iso­lated is­lands of poverty and hu­man degra­da­tion. Democ­racy and free mar­kets: 75 Years ago we were in the grip of ide­olo­gies that were cre­ated by mankind on the premise that God did not ex­ist and that man was fun­da­men­tally good and would even­tu­ally cre­ate a world in which we were all equal and all had enough to live on in com­fort. It was an en­tic­ing vi­sion and cap­tured much of the world’s pop­u­la­tion. In de­fence the coun­tries whose his­tory dic­tated a dif­fer­ent world­view based on the Bi­ble and the Chris­tian tra­di­tions laid down in the pre­vi­ous cen­turies, raised up bar­ri­ers of po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and even mil­i­tary might. They ar­gued that our democ­ra­cies and free mar­ket so­ci­eties were su­pe­rior in ev­ery way to the path the com­mu­nist States had cho­sen. When the United States led the world down a road that led to the demise of the Soviet Em­pire (Rea­gan) and the open­ing up of China (Nixon), we all thought we were on the bound­ary of a new dis­pen­sa­tion. The poli­cies of the West had won. Democ­racy and free­dom would sweep the world. The re­al­ity is very dif­fer­ent, Rus­sia is now a medium-sized power, but once again un­der the con­trol of the Ortho­dox Church and a Tsar. China has be­come part of the world, no longer in self-iso­la­tion and poor, in­stead a global player with the power and reach to in­flu­ence the world. Now we have the COVID-19 pan­demic and a global cri­sis that is rooted in the bug and its af­ter­math. That would be enough of a prob­lem to dis­turb our new sense of se­cu­rity and pur­pose ex­cept that in the past four years the United States has had a Pres­i­dent who has chal­lenged the very foun­da­tions of this global and con­ti­nen­tal sys­tem that has done so much for ev­ery­one. Thank God for the strong in­sti­tu­tions in the USA and the ex­am­ple of po­lit­i­cal san­ity when the Vice-Pres­i­dent of the United States stood up in Congress and in a dig­ni­fied and calm way read out the re­sults of the re­cent elec­tion that will bring Bi­den into power on the 20th of Jan­uary. Trump has done enough to sink his po­lit­i­cal ship and per­haps we can now go back to the ba­sics that have served mankind so well in the past half cen­tury. But can it ever be busi­ness as usual? We need to step back and use this cri­sis to re­view our val­ues and be­liefs and chal­lenge the grow­ing sec­u­lar­ism and ag­nos­ti­cism that is tak­ing hold. We need to re­turn to the truths con­tained in the Bi­ble that mankind is not only a cre­ated be­ing who has po­ten­tial for both good and evil. Did we ever need to un­der­stand that when we have such stark ex­am­ples in our re­cent his­tory? We need to un­der­stand and ac­cept that hu­man lead­er­ship out­side of the ba­sic fear of God and the con­se­quences of vi­o­lat­ing His rules of life, is al­ways danger­ous. China is to be feared, not be­cause of its power and eco­nomic ca­pac­ity, but be­cause God is not revered and feared in its cham­bers of power. Mankind can only be trusted with power on earth if he un­der­stood that he would be held to ac­count and that there must be lim­its to his au­thor­ity and reach. The ma­jor­ity of the men who crafted the US Con­sti­tu­tion were deeply Chris­tian men who had fled Europe amid re­li­gious per­se­cu­tion. They un­der­stood the lim­i­ta­tions of hu­man gov­er­nance and de­lib­er­ately con­sti­tuted the USA in a sys­tem of checks and bal­ances that has kept the US on the rails of his­tory all th­ese years and this con­tin­ues to­day — as we have just wit­nessed. The dan­ger that presents it­self to us to­day is rooted in the fact that Europe is fast be­com­ing what we might call a post Chris­tian so­ci­ety. The most un­godly na­tion on earth to­day is prob­a­bly sec­u­lar France, not post-Com­mu­nist China or Rus­sia. The fastest grow­ing Chris­tian Church in the world to­day is prob­a­bly in China which does not even recog­nise God in its af­fairs. Wher­ever peo­ple have to strug­gle ev­ery­day for their ba­sics, God is at the very cen­tre of their be­ing and their hold­ing on to any kind of be­lief in the thought that there might be some wider mean­ing to life and a bet­ter fu­ture for all of us. When the world throws us into a tu­mult and up­sets all that we hold on to for safety and se­cu­rity, the only thing to do is to put your hand in His hands and en­trust Him with your fu­ture. It is af­ter all, the only place of safety.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210205,Mthuli in COVID-19 vac­cine fees U-turn,"FI­NANCE min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube (pic­tured) yes­ter­day said COVID-19 vac­cines would be given for free, climb­ing down from his ear­lier state­ment that pri­vate cit­i­zens would pay for the jab. Ncube this week told State me­dia that some Zim­bab­weans would be re­quired to pay for COVID-19 vac­ci­na­tion, trig­ger­ing an out­cry from the pop­u­la­tion al­ready bur­dened with poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) screen­ing costs for the virus. He said there was noth­ing for free for Zim­babwe’s pri­vate cit­i­zens with­out be­ing spe­cific on who will be made to pay for the vac­cine, adding that the in­oc­u­la­tion would cost be­tween US$3 to US$7 per dose. He said the pay­ment was meant to en­able the gov­ern- ment to “re­coup” costs of pro­cure­ment. But yes­ter­day, Ncube made a U-turn in a state­ment say­ing COVID-19 treat­ment would be free, claim­ing that his ear­lier ut­ter­ances were taken out of con­text. “It has come to my at­ten­tion that my com­ments about the pay­ment for the COVID-19 vac­cine have been taken out of con­text,” Ncube said in the state­ment. “I would like to make it clear that the vac­cines that the gov­ern­ment is procur­ing with the sup­port of our in­ter­na­tional part­ners and friends, will be made avail­able for free, to the cit­i­zens of Zim­babwe.” Be­fore the Fi­nance min­is­ter is­sued his state­ment, Vice-Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga, in ap­par­ent re­sponse to the Fi­nance min­is­ter’s ini­tial po­si­tion, said: “Life should not be bought.” Chi­wenga, who is also Health min­is­ter said this in his World Can­cer Day ad­dress. “Let me also re­it­er­ate that the gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe will roll out COVID-19 vac­cines to all our cit­i­zens who may wish to be vac­ci­nated. The pol­icy is in­spired by hu­mane morals that life should not be bought,” he said. Zim­babwe is ex­pect­ing to take de­liv­ery of its first batch of COVID-19 vac­cines from China, which has pledged to as­sist trou­bled na­tions, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe, with vac­cines to be de­liv­ered soon, ac­cord­ing the Asian giant’s For­eign Af­fairs min­istry spokesper­son Wang Wen­bin. Other coun­tries to ben­e­fit in­clude Be­larus, Equa­to­rial Guinea, Pak­istan, Brunei, Nepal, the Philip­pines, Myan­mar, Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Mon­go­lia, Pak­istan and Sierra Leone. Zim­babwe is also set to re­ceive just over one mil­lion doses of the As­traZeneca/Ox­ford COVID-19 vac­cine in the first quar­ter un­der the Covax Fa­cil­ity, ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment re­leased by the or­gan­is­ers on Wed­nes­day. Last week, Ncube and Fi­nance sec­re­tary Ge­orge Gu­va­matanga said the coun­try had mo­bilised about US$100 mil­lion for the pur­poses of procur­ing COVID-19 vac­cines. Reel­ing un­der the weight of the sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus, with in­fec­tions and deaths mount­ing, the coun­try is ex­pect­ing three mil­lion doses from the global fa­cil­ity meant to fa­cil­i­tate eq­ui­table global ac­cess to COVID-19 vac­cines across the globe to ar­rest the spread of the virus that has killed over 2,2 mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally. But Ncube trig­gered a storm when he said only front­line work­ers and the vul­ner­a­ble would freely get the COVID-19 vac­cines, while the rest of the pop­u­la­tion would be made to pay when peo­ple are al­ready fret­ting over high COVID-19 PCR screen­ing costs which they wanted to be pro­vided for free. “Pri­vate cit­i­zens will have to pay for the vac­cine,” he told the State-con­trolled tele­vi­sion sta­tion ZTN. “The vac­cine is ac­tu­ally cheaper than some of the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment that we are procur­ing. “There will be some pay­ment model so that gov­ern­ment can re­coup the cost of pro­cure­ment,” Ncube was ini­tially quoted as say­ing. He added: “It will be nice to cover ev­ery­one beyond the 10 mil­lion (tar­geted un­der the US$100 mil­lion fa­cil­ity), we want to cover the en­tire pop­u­la­tion. “So, re­ally pay­ing some­thing for the vac­cine from pri­vate cit­i­zens is very im­por­tant so that we can cover those who can­not af­ford at all. “But there will be some groups that will be given the vac­cine for free. The Health min­istry will clar­ify all these is­sues and re­veal how dif­fer­ent groups within the coun­try will be treated re­gard­ing the vac­ci­na­tion.” The Cri­sis in Zim­babwe Coali­tion (CiZC) said over 90% of Zim­bab­weans were “vul­ner­a­ble”, hence would all re­quire free vac­ci­na­tion. “The harsh eco­nomic con­di­tions cur­rently ob­tain­ing in Zim­babwe have re­duced al­most 90% of the pop­u­la­tion to vul­ner­a­ble cit­i­zens who can­not af­ford health care,” CiZC spokesper­son Marvel­lous Khu­malo said. “Gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees con­tinue to live far be­low the poverty da­tum line and af­ford­ing the COVID-19 vac­ci­na­tion, which will cost be­tween US$2,50 to US$7,50 per jab, will be an up­hill task for most fam­i­lies,” he said. Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa, in his ad­dress to the na­tion yes­ter­day, said his gov­ern­ment was aim­ing at vac­ci­nat­ing at least 60% of the pop­u­la­tion to achieve pop­u­la­tion im­mu­nity. “Our over­all na­tional re­sponse strat­egy has reached a stage where we can now in­tro­duce vac­cines as a sec­ond front pre­ven­tive mea­sure. “As such, COVID-19 vac­cines which have been sci­en­tif­i­cally as­cer­tained to be safe will soon be in­tro­duced. These will be state-funded and free,” he said. “The first phase of in­oc­u­la­tion will see our hard­work­ing front­line work­ers, the el­derly and those with un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions be­ing pri­ori­tised. “Nev­er­the­less, gov­ern­ment is aware that the vac­cines do not pro­vide 100% pro­tec­tion, or in part, im­mu­nity.”",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210317,Teach­ers give no­tice to strike,"THE ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor is set to suf­fer another heavy blow af­ter teach­ers and State univer­sity em­ploy­ees gave no­tice yes­ter­day to em­bark on a na­tion­wide in­dus­trial ac­tion start­ing Mon­day to press for bet­ter work­ing con­di­tions. The day co­in­cides with the re­sump­tion of classes for non-ex­am­i­na­tion pupils af­ter ex­am­i­na­tion classes started their lessons on Mon­day this week. State univer­sity em­ploy­ees also gave a 14-day no­tice to the Pub­lic Ser­vice min­istry an­nounc­ing their in­ten­tion to em­bark on a strike in protest over low wages. Their no­tice came at a time gov­ern­ment has ap­proved a 200% hike in univer­sity fees, which will re­sult in stu­dents at State uni­ver­si­ties fork­ing out be­tween $25 000 and $40 000 per se­mes­ter, up from $9 000. “This is a 14-day no­tice of in­ten­tion to em­bark on a strike by the Zim­babwe Uni­ver­si­ties and Al­lied Work­ers Union (ZUAWU) and the Zim­babwe State Uni­ver­si­ties Union of Academics (ZISUUA), hereby re­ferred to as the Zim­babwe State Uni­ver­si­ties Joint Coun­cil, on be­half of all State uni­ver­si­ties’ work­ers. “The em­ploy­ees de­mand that the em­ployer makes ur­gent steps to at­tain the re­gional level salary scales as per the agree­ments of 2010,” read the let­ter by Alois Muzvuwe and Ready­for­ward Dube, the ZISUUA and ZUAWU rep­re­sen­ta­tives. The Amal­ga­mated Ru­ral Teach­ers Union of Zim­babwe (Ar­tuz) re­leased a state­ment yes­ter­day invit­ing ci­ti­zens to join them on the streets on March 22 in na­tion­wide protests dubbed #SaveOurE­d­u­ca­tionZw. The ru­ral teach­ers threat­ened that the protests would con­tinue un­til their griev­ances were ad­dressed. “In Septem­ber 2020, we pro­duced a de­tailed Ed­u­ca­tion in Cri­sis Re­port cit­ing both ur­gent is­sues that need to be at­tended to and long-term struc­tural de­fi­cien­cies which have to be re­solved. We fur­ther made rec­om­men­da­tions to the gov­ern­ment, some of which do not need any fi­nan­cial in­vest­ment. The re­port was ig­nored by the gov­ern­ment, but schools open­ing was aborted be­cause of the chal­lenges we had raised,” the Ar­tuz state­ment read. They accused gov­ern­ment of ig­nor­ing the rec­om­men­da­tions by the Fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe Ed­u­ca­tors Unions (Fozeu), which in­cludes teach­ers’ unions, and a po­si­tion pa­per by Ar­tuz on safe and ef­fec­tive re­open­ing of schools. Ar­tuz, in its no­tice for na­tion­wide protests, cited the poor 2020 Grade 7 pass rate, which dropped by 9% com­pared to the 2019 re­sults, say­ing if gov­ern­ment fails to re­sus­ci­tate the ail­ing ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor, pass rates would con­tinue on a down­ward spi­ral. “The num­ber of teenage preg­nan­cies is ris­ing, with a re­cent re­port re­veal­ing that 5 000 teenagers were im­preg­nated in a month. This rev­e­la­tion re­minds us that the longer learn­ers stay at home, the more dif­fi­cult it is for them to re­turn to schools. It is, there­fore, im­per­a­tive for us to force the gov­ern­ment to ur­gently re­solve the ed­u­ca­tion cri­sis. “Gov­ern­ment should deal with the is­sue of teacher pre­pared­ness to teach. Teach­ers are cur­rently in­ca­pac­i­tated be­cause of un­der­pay­ment. The uni­lat­eral vari­a­tion of teacher con­tracts by the gov­ern­ment in 2018 led to a sys­tem­atic wage theft, which left teach­ers wal­low­ing in poverty,” read the Ar­tuz no­tice. The ru­ral teach­ers also said gov­ern­ment needed to in­crease the Ba­sic Ed­u­ca­tion As­sis­tance Mod­ule (Beam) fees sup­port as more vul­ner­a­ble learn­ers were trau­ma­tised, adding that a coun­selling regime had to be op­er­a­tionalised in schools to deal with the trauma of the lock­downs. Moses Mhike, a team leader rep­re­sent­ing gov­ern­ment in the Na­tional Joint Ne­go­ti­at­ing Com­mis­sion (NJNC), said the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion (PSC) had not yet re­ceived com­mu­ni­ca­tion from teach­ers’ unions on the pro­posed na­tion­wide protests. “We have not re­ceived any­thing from them, we are just get­ting to know of it from the Press,” Mhike said. Pri­mary and Sec­ondary Ed­u­ca­tion min­istry spokesper­son Taun­gana Ndoro said: “Yes, I saw some­thing from the 386-mem­ber union called Ar­tuz. The min­istry con­tin­ues to urge all well-mean­ing teach­ers to re­port for duty on time and with com­mit­ment as gov­ern­ment seeks to ad­dress their griev­ances.” Last week, gov­ern­ment reached a dead­lock with civil ser­vants af­ter the work­ers re­jected a “pal­try” 25% salary in­cre­ment dur­ing an NJNC meet­ing. Mean­while, dis­grun­tled teach­ers in Bu­l­awayo have formed another teach­ers’ union called Ed­u­ca­tors Union of Zim­babwe (EUZ) af­ter ac­cus­ing other unions of de­vi­at­ing from their man­date. EUZ in­terim sec­re­tary-gen­eral Justin Murema told NewsDay that some teach­ers’ unions had be­come an ex­ten­sion of the em­ployer, while others were med­dling in op­po­si­tion party pol­i­tics, hence the need for an apo­lit­i­cal teach­ers’ rep­re­sen­ta­tive body. Murema said like other unions, his mem­ber­ship wanted the restora­tion of their salaries to 2018 lev­els which were in United States dol­lars and start­ing from US$520 to US$550. “We are here to offer the miss­ing ser­vices from those of­fered by other unions by bring­ing all teach­ers’ is­sues un­der one um­brella for a fruit­ful dis­cus­sion with the em­ployer. Around 70 000 out of 130 000 teach­ers in the coun­try are not in any union mem­ber­ship and EUZ seeks to re­cruit more of these un­rep­re­sented teach­ers,” Murema said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170209,Fo­cac Sum­mit game changer in Sino-Africa re­la­tions,"THE Sixth Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion held in Jo­han­nes­burg, South Africa in 2015 was a defin­ing mo­ment in co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two sides. From that sum­mit, China and Africa have been re­fo­cus­ing on the im­por­tant mat­ters that now de­fine the way for­ward in their mu­tual re­la­tions. In fact, the game has changed since that sum­mit and China is now fo­cus­ing more on in­vest­ing in Africa and, es­pe­cially the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent. At the Jo­han­nes­burg sum­mit, de­lib­er­ate mea­sures were put in mo­tion to push ahead a pro­gramme that will change the sta­tus of Africa within the com­ing few years. That China has an ap­petite to in­vest in Africa is not a se­cret. But what is im­por­tant about China’s in­ter­est is that it is based on win-win co­op­er­a­tion, mu­tual in­ter­est and mu­tual re­la­tions. African coun­tries need to wake up to the re­al­ity that the capital they so much re­quire is read­ily avail­able in China. What they now need to do is come up with bank­able projects that will im­press fi­nan­cial back­ers from that coun­try. In the past, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment used to pro­vide grants to Africa gov­ern­ments for car­ry­ing out projects, but this is now un­sus­tain­able, con­sid­er­ing the huge scope of work that needs to be done. This is where the pri­vate sec­tor in China comes in, to­gether with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions such as the China Ex­port and Im­port Bank, the China Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund and the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank. These in­sti­tu­tions now pro­vide the fi­nan­cial back­ing to Chi­nese firms that are com­ing to in­vest in Africa. This means that African gov­ern­ments and their firms should be ready to en­ter part­ner­ships with these Chi­nese firms, es­pe­cially on in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. What is also needed is for the part­ner­ships to be at­trac­tive and the projects be able to bring a re­turn to en­able the re­pay­ment of the loans from the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. To un­der­stand how the Jo­han­nes­burg Fo­cac sum­mit changed the game, it is pru­dent to briefly have a look at Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s open­ing re­marks at the meet­ing. In his speech, Pres­i­dent Xi out­lined the new di­rec­tion the re­la­tions be­tween China and Africa will take from hence forth through a 10-point plan he an­nounced. China-Africa in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion plan Pres­i­dent Xi ex­plained that his coun­try will ac­tively pro­mote in­dus­try part­ner­ing and pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa and en­cour­age more Chi­nese en­ter­prises to make busi­ness in­vest­ments in Africa. He said China will build or up­grade a num­ber of in­dus­trial parks in co­op­er­a­tion with Africa, send se­nior gov­ern­ment ex­perts and ad­vis­ers to Africa and set up re­gional vo­ca­tional ed­u­ca­tion cen­tres and schools for ca­pac­ity build­ing. Un­der this first point, China will also train 200 000 tech­ni­cal per­son­nel and pro­vide 40 000 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for African per­son­nel in China. China-Africa agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion plan Pres­i­dent Xi made it clear that China will share its ex­pe­ri­ence in agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment with Africa and trans­fer read­ily ap­pli­ca­ble tech­nolo­gies. His gov­ern­ment will en­cour­age Chi­nese en­ter­prises to en­gage in large-scale farm­ing, an­i­mal hus­bandry and grain stor­age and pro­cess­ing in Africa to cre­ate more lo­cal jobs and in­crease farm­ers’ in­come. China will carry out agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment projects in 100 African vil­lages to raise ru­ral liv­ing stan­dards, send 30 teams of agri­cul­tural ex­perts to Africa, and es­tab­lish co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms be­tween Chi­nese and African agri­cul­tural re­search in­sti­tutes. China-Africa in­fra­struc­ture plan Un­der this de­vel­op­ment plan, China will step up mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in in­fra­struc­ture plan­ning, de­sign, con­struc­tion, op­er­a­tion, and main­te­nance. Pres­i­dent Xi said his coun­try will sup­port Chi­nese en­ter­prises’ ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion in Africa’s in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment, par­tic­u­larly in sec­tors such as rail­ways, roads, re­gional avi­a­tion, ports, elec­tric­ity and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, to en­hance Africa’s ca­pac­ity for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. There will also be sup­port for African coun­tries to es­tab­lish five trans­porta­tion uni­ver­si­ties. China-Africa fi­nan­cial plan Pres­i­dent Xi said China will ex­pand its RMB (Chi­nese cur­rency) set­tle­ment and cur­rency swap op­er­a­tions with African coun­tries. His gov­ern­ment will also en­cour­age Chi­nese fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to set up more branches in Africa, and in­crease in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing co­op­er­a­tion in mul­ti­ple ways to pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port and ser­vices for Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion drive. China-Africa green de­vel­op­ment plan Pres­i­dent Xi said un­der this plan, China will sup­port Africa in bol­ster­ing its ca­pac­ity for green, low-car­bon and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and sup­port the con­ti­nent in launch­ing 100 projects to de­velop clean en­ergy, pro­tect wildlife, pro­mote en­vi­ron­ment-friendly agri­cul­ture and build smart ci­ties. China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion will never be pur­sued at the ex­pense of Africa’s eco-sys­tem and long-term in­ter­ests, he said. China-Africa trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion plan China will carry out 50 aid-for-trade pro­grammes to im­prove Africa’s ca­pac­ity, both “soft­ware” and “hard­ware”, for con­duct­ing in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal trade and in­vest­ment, an­nounced Pres­i­dent Xi. China is also ready to ne­go­ti­ate with coun­tries and re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions in Africa for com­pre­hen­sive free trade agree­ments cov­er­ing trade in goods and ser­vices and in­vest­ment co­op­er­a­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi said his coun­try will in­crease im­port of African prod­ucts and sup­port African coun­tries in en­hanc­ing law en­force­ment ca­pac­ity in ar­eas such as cus­toms, qual­ity in­spec­tion and tax­a­tion. There will be en­gage­ment in co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in stan­dard­i­s­a­tion, cer­ti­fi­ca­tion and ac­cred­i­ta­tion and e-com­merce. China-Africa poverty re­duc­tion plan While in­ten­si­fy­ing its own poverty re­duc­tion ef­forts, China will in­crease its aid to Africa, an­nounced Pres­i­dent Xi. He China will carry out in Africa 200 “Happy Life” projects and poverty re­duc­tion pro­grammes fo­cus­ing on women and chil­dren. The Asian coun­try will can­cel out­stand­ing debts in the form of bi­lat- eral gov­ern­men­tal zero-in­ter­est loans bor­rowed by the rel­e­vant least de­vel­oped African coun­tries. China-Africa pub­lic health plan Un­der this plan, China will help Africa strengthen its pub­lic health pre­ven­tion and con­trol sys­tem, as well as its ca­pac­ity build­ing by par­tic­i­pat­ing in the build­ing of the African Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol. There will be sup­port for pace­set­ting co­op­er­a­tion be­tween 20 Chi­nese hos­pi­tals and 20 African hos­pi­tals, and up­grade hospi­tal de­part­ments. China will also con­tinue to send med­i­cal teams to Africa and pro­vide med­i­cal as­sis­tance such as the “Bright­ness Ac­tion” pro­gramme for cataract pa­tients and ma­ter­nal and child care. Pres­i­dent Xi promised to pro­vide more anti-malaria com­pound artemisinin to Africa, and en­cour­age and sup­port lo­cal drug pro­duc­tion by Chi­nese en­ter­prises in Africa to in­crease Africans’ ac­cess to medicine. China-Africa cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple plan This im­por­tant plan in re­la­tions be­tween the two sides will see China build­ing five cul­tural cen­tres in Africa and pro­vide satel­lite TV re­cep­tion to 10 000 African vil­lages. ◆ Feed­back: lchiko­vahh@ya­hoo.com Read the full ar­ti­cle on www.her­ald.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170525,Africa Day: Time to take bold steps to­wards in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion,"TODAY is a big day for Africa, as peo­ple from the con­ti­nent gather at venues in all parts of the world to com­mem­o­rate the 54th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity (OAU). In Zim­babwe, there will be spe­cial cel­e­bra­tions at a city ho­tel today, set to be at­tended by Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, diplo­mats, the pri­vate sec­tor and other key stake­hold­ers. The theme adopted for this year’s cel­e­bra­tions is: “Har­ness­ing the de­mo­graphic div­i­dend through in­vest­ments in youths”. That the OAU no longer ex­ists in its ini­tial form is a fact in the pub­lic do­main. Lead­ers from the con­ti­nent con­vened in Dur­ban, South Africa, in 2002 to re­name the body into the present day African Union (AU). The trans­for­ma­tion of the OAU into the AU was not only in the change of name. It sig­ni­fied a new di­rec­tion that the con­ti­nent was now tak­ing as a bloc, es­pe­cially to en­sure that the gains of the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle were trans­formed into tan­gi­ble eco­nomic ben­e­fits for the peo­ple. The OAU fo­cused mainly on en­sur­ing that all coun­tries on the con­ti­nent be­came free from colo­nial­ism. This is why the body went on to form a lib­er­a­tion com­mit­tee to en­hance the fight against white dom­i­na­tion on the con­ti­nent. With South Africa be­ing the last to gain its in­de­pen­dence in 1994, it was in­evitable that the pan-African body changes its course from fight­ing for lib­er­a­tion. It was time to face new chal­lenges be­dev­illing the con­ti­nent, and this ex­plained why one of the AU’s man­date is to spear­head the eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion of the con­ti­nent. It is a fact that African lead­ers are con­fronted with a mam­moth task to turn­around the eco­nomic for­tunes of the con­ti­nent, which ranks far be­low ac­cept­able lev­els. Many peo­ple have of­ten won­dered why Africa, a con­ti­nent so rich in vast re­sources, still ex­tends a beg­ging bowl to other con­ti­nents in a bid to change its sta­tus. While Africa Day is meant to cel­e­brate the unity and sol­i­dar­ity of the con­ti­nent’s found­ing fa­thers who gave it all for its free­dom and in­de­pen­dence, it is also time to re­flect on what should be done with the econ­omy. All those in­ter­ested in the de­vel­op­ment of Africa should be us­ing Africa Day to map strate­gies of how to pluck the con­ti­nent from the jaws of poverty. What is needed for now is for the con­ti­nent to seek part­ner­ships with other coun­tries and de­vel­op­ment agen­cies, to en­sure that the much sought af­ter eco­nomic eman­ci­pa­tion is re­alised. China of­fers a good ex­am­ple in this area. It is known that China was once in a predica­ment like that fac­ing Africa — poverty, hunger, po­lit­i­cal strife and lack of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. But within a few years, the Asian coun­try has man­aged to turn its for­tunes around, and by 2020 all the more than 1,3 bil­lion Chi­nese will be liv­ing out of poverty. Africans should ded­i­cate their time as they mark Africa Day today to re­flect­ing on the mea­sures taken by China to im­prove its des­per­ate sit­u­a­tion. While the con­ti­nent’s Agenda 2063, which un­der­lines its new vi­sion for eco­nomic eman­ci­pa­tion, is gain­ing trac­tion, it is im­por­tant that lessons are drawn from else­where to help move for­ward the agenda. And such lessons can be drawn from China, es­pe­cially on the pro­grammes it im­ple­mented to en­sure its peo­ple were out of poverty. What is needed by African lead­ers is to ap­pre­ci­ate that while the con­ti­nent is in­deed chart­ing its own way for­ward, some­times it lacks ca­pac­ity, es­pe­cially to im­ple­ment life chang­ing projects. This is where China’s win-win co­op­er­a­tion can be ex­ploited for the ben­e­fit of both sides. Africa lacks cap­i­tal to em­bark on such mam­moth projects, and ad­mit­tance by the lead­ers that the sit­u­a­tion needs tan­gi­ble re­forms will see the con­ti­nent chang­ing for the bet­ter. That was the pre­cise rea­son why China em­barked on a re­form and open­ing up pol­icy in the late 1970s, which has been cred­ited for the progress be­ing re­alised in the Asian eco­nomic giant. Chi­nese lead­ers re­alised that no mat­ter how they tried hard, they could not ef­fect changes in the econ­omy with­out cap­i­tal. So, the re­form and open­ing up pol­icy was meant to at­tract the much needed cap­i­tal from coun­tries and firms will­ing to in­vest. The re­sult was an in­flux of com­pa­nies from all over the world that brought their cap­i­tal and set up in­dus­tries in China. Low tar­iffs for taxes, ex­ports and labour were put in place to at­tract the for­eign in­vestors. The cre­ation of Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones turned out to be the mas­ter stroke for China. The re­served spe­cial trad­ing zones are much cred­ited with the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of China, as big cor­po­rates from the de­vel­oped world were at­tracted by the in­cen­tives. I am not sug­gest­ing that Africa should take ex­am­ples from China “hook, line and sinker”, but it is worth that the sit­u­a­tion in China be thor­oughly stud­ied with the aim of map­ping the con­ti­nent’s own de­vel­op­men­tal agenda. What has Africa done with value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of its abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources? This is one key ques­tion con­fronting the con­ti­nent’s Agenda 2063, which aims at en­sur­ing that all coun­tries on the con­ti­nent en­joy some form of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion by that year. The con­ti­nent needs part­ner­ships with those pos­sess­ing cap­i­tal to in­vest in in­dus­tries that con­cen­trate on value ad­di­tion of the min­er­als. At the mo­ment, many African coun­tries are ex­port­ing their min­er­als in raw form, a sit­u­a­tion that has en­sured they get lit­tle re­turns. As Africa marks the 54th an­niver­sary of the AU today, its lead­ers should be tak­ing a hard look at what needs to be done to im­prove the lives of the peo­ple. Com­mit­ment to push a de­vel­op­men­tal path for the con­ti­nent is demon­strated by pro­grammes such as Agenda 2063. But it is time to take Agenda 2063 out of con­fer­ence rooms for im­ple­men­ta­tion. Of course, China has made it clear that it is will­ing to help Africa move into the phase of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, but with­out com­mit­ment from the con­ti­nent this will be fu­tile. Only those who show com­mit­ment to a cer­tain de­vel­op­ment path stand to gain from the mas­sive in­vest­ment that is be­ing availed, es­pe­cially by China. In 2015, China set aside $60 bil­lion just for en­hanc­ing the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process in Africa, but this money will not come on a sil­ver plat­ter. Only those who prove their worth through sub­mit­ting vi­able eco­nomic projects will be able to gain. The found­ing fa­thers of the AU wanted the body to help foster unity on the con­ti­nent to en­hance chances of eco­nomic progress and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. This is the same vi­sion be­ing pur­sued by the present day lead­ers on the con­ti­nent. Unity of pur­pose also un­der­lines the suc­cess sto­ries of coun­tries that have man­aged to make it and with­out this spe­cial bond, Africa’s as­pi­ra­tions will take long to ful­fil. Africa Day com­mem­o­ra­tions should pro­vide a chance for lead­ers to make bold and rad­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions when it comes to tack­ling the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic sta­tus. The con­ti­nent can­not af­ford to con­tinue re­main­ing lowly ranked when it pos­sesses so much re­sources with the po­ten­tial to an­chor its own in­dus­trial revo­lu­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20170611,A read­ing from the Chi­nese story,"WITH China’s eco­nomic growth tale now an over­whelm­ing al­lure for the en­tire world, the lin­ger­ing ques­tion for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as Zim­babwe is what les­sons to take from the Asian gi­ant suc­cess story to im­ple­ment for na­tional de­vel­op­ment tra­jec­to­ries. China has made it clear that it wants to share its suc­cess with other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries — in line with its en­trenched tra­di­tion of al­tru­ism. Over 30 or so years ago, the Ori­en­tal State was a de­vel­op­ing coun­try like Zim­babwe but it has turned the cor­ner to be­come the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world with a GDP of about US$11 tril­lion com­pared to the United States’ US$18 tril­lion. China’s mes­sage to other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries is that eco­nomic turn­around is not a dis­tant fairy tale, but a real­ity within clutch­ing dis­tance — if only the right steps are fol­lowed. De­liv­er­ing a lec­ture here dur­ing the on­go­ing Sem­i­nar for Renowned Jour­nal­ists from Africa here last week, Mr Zhou Ming­wei of the China In­ter­na­tional Pub­lish­ing Group pointed out that China does not want to ex­pe­ri­ence its growth alone. China wants to share its de­vel­op­ment with the rest of the world and it wants other coun­tries to copy the cor­rect les­sons from its suc­cesses. In his lec­ture, Mr Zhou, said de­vel­op­ing coun­tries need to start by hav­ing the right at­ti­tude as well as the mo­ti­va­tion to as­pire for a bet­ter life for the gen­er­al­ity of the pop­u­la­tion and not just a mi­nor­ity. Mr Zhou said China’s eco­nomic suc­cess has been an­chored on a dis­ci­pline and con­sis­tency and man­ag­ing the ac­com­plish­ments be­cause any mis­takes could lead to dis­as­trous con­se­quences for the pop­u­lous coun­try. “One of the chal­lenges we have is to main­tain our suc­cess and also to man­age it,” he said. “There is no sin­gle for­mula for suc­cess but there are some fun­da­men­tals that you have to abide by. “Eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment is the key to any­thing so you have to have the wel­fare of your peo­ple in mind all the time. “You also have to keep the cap­i­tal open and have an open door pol­icy to make sure that the cap­i­tal comes in. “You also have to strike out a balance be­tween re­form, sta­bil­ity and de­vel­op­ment. “You can­not have de­vel­op­ment with­out re­form.” The Chi­nese men­tal­ity has been that you can­not wait for the per­fect mo­ment to be­gin the de­vel­op­ment tra­jec­tory be­cause the per­fect mo­ment is al­ways “the now”. One im­por­tant les­son to learn from China is that not every­thing is per­fect in the coun­try but, when­ever there is com­mon in­ter­est to pull in the right di­rec­tion, the good al­ways over­rides the bad. While the cities in China such as Bei­jing and Shang­hai are highly de­vel­oped, the western part of coun­try is still de­vel­op­ing. Poverty is com­mon in Western China and a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of the pop­u­la­tion in th­ese parts live be­yond the stan­dard poverty da­tum line. How­ever, this fac­tor has not de­terred China from as­sum­ing its place as a global eco­nomic gi­ant. Pre­sent­ing an­other lec­ture, Mr Huang Youyi of the China In­ter­na­tional Pub­lish­ing Group said there is strong sense of col­lec­tivism among Chi­nese which di­rects that the poor West of China ben­e­fits from the riches of other parts of the coun­try. “There is a huge gulf in class be­tween the high­est paid and the low­est paid work­ers,” he said “In 2015, the low­est paid worker earned US$ 3, 1923 per year but the high­est paid chief ex­ec­u­tive took home US$19, 44 mil­lion a year. “We ac­knowl­edge that when we grew our econ­omy, we over­looked cer­tain as­pects and this is one of the is­sues we are ad­dress­ing. “What we are now do­ing is to take cor­rec­tive mea­sures to re­duce the gap and make sure that the gulf be­tween the rich and the poor is re­duced. China plans to lift its en­tire peo­ple out of poverty by 2020.” Un­der the con­cept of the “New Nor­mal”, China has come up with the Pair­ing Sys­tem where com­pa­nies from the rich east are obliged to as­sist the West. Mr Huang also noted that fight­ing cor­rup­tion has been one of the foun­da­tions for China’s eco­nomic growth. The Gov­ern­ment of Pres­i­dent Xi Xin­ping has zero tol­er­ance on cor­rup­tion and any­one found on the wrong side of the law, no mat­ter how in­flu­en­tial, faces the con­se­quences. This is why hun­dreds of army gen­er­als and other se­nior Gov­ern­ment have been sent to jail for cor­rup­tion and this has served as a de­ter­rent for any would be of­fend­ers. The anti-cor­rup­tion drive in China is so ef­fec­tive in that any per­son in the coun­try can alert au­thor­i­ties of any sus­pected cor­rup­tion and ev­ery al­leged case is in­ves­ti­gated by the Cen­tral In­spec­tion De­part­ment of China. China has come up with the 8-Point Reg­u­la­tion against cor­rup­tion where all top of­fi­cials, start­ing from the high­est de­ci­sion mak­ing or­gan, the Polit­buro to the low­est of­fi­cial in Gov­ern­ment are un­der scru­tiny. The Ori­en­tal State is able to swal­low bit­ter pills to en­sure that it main­tains its de­vel­op­ment. For ex­am­ple, while most peo­ple in Zim­babwe now con­sider buy­ing a car a ne­ces­sity, in China a car is a lux­ury as it is dif­fi­cult to buy one be­cause au­thor­i­ties have a strin­gent pol­icy to con­trol the num­ber of ve­hi­cles so as to man­age pol­lu­tion and the vol­umes of traf­fic. For an or­di­nary per­son in China, the bi­cy­cle is the most com­mon form of trans­port. One sig­nif­i­cant as­pect about China is that it is con­tin­u­ing to in­crease its in­vest­ment abroad. In 2016 alone, China in­vested more than US$1,7 tril­lion in­ter­na­tion­ally. The ques­tion for Zim­babwe is how much of this came into the coun­try and what more needs to be done to con­tinue at­tract­ing Chi­nese in­vest­ment. In an­other lec­turer vet­eran Chi­nese diplo­mat Ren Xiaop­ing said China’s re­la­tions with Africa are based on the five prin­ci­ples of co-ex­is­tence which were re­spect for sovereignty, re­spect for each other’s ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, non ag­gres­sion, non-in­ter­fer­ence of in­ter­nal af­fairs and equal­ity and mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion. She said China’s con­science is clear in the face of western driven pro­pa­ganda which sug­gests that China could be colonis­ing Africa, as the Asian Gi­ant has al­ways had a his­tory of as­sist­ing Africa from the days of the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle of many Africa States. Such as­sis­tance, she said, was un­con­di­tional and was an­chored on China’s well known self­less­ness, which the Asian Gi­ant is now im­ple­ment­ing on the eco­nomic front. With Fi­nance Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa hav­ing pro­jected eco­nomic growth at 3,6 per­cent this year, there is need to put China in the mir­ror and see what we can copy from the Asian Gi­ant. In 2007, China’s eco­nomic growth was pegged at 3,7 per­cent but from then on, the growth rates have been ris­ing like a crescendo. As a start­ing point, if Zim­babwe can achieve the eco­nomic growth tar­get of 3,6 per­cent, which is a strik­ing sim­i­lar­ity to China’s growth rate in 2007. China’s mes­sage to other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries is that eco­nomic turn­around is not a dis­tant fairy tale, but a real­ity within clutch­ing dis­tance — if only the right steps are fol­lowed.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20200202,"How to deal with poverty:
An adap­ta­tion of
Prof Mthuli’s con­tri­bu­tion","POVERTY lev­els are swelling in Zim­babwe as much as they are in ev­ery part of greater Africa. Among some of the ex­pla­na­tions of the causes, fla­grant pol­icy-mak­ing marred with in­con­sis­ten­cies has been said to be a dis­state to both for­eign and do­mes­tic investment across the whole con­ti­nent. De­spite nu­mer­ous de­bates on causes and ef­fects of poverty in Africa, what is more im­por­tant are the so­lu­tions that can pos­si­bly im­pact change. Some of the com­mend­able in­sights on reme­dies of Africa’s plight are de­ducted from Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube, Zim­babwe’s Minister of Finance and Economic Devel­op­ment con­tri­bu­tions to an African Devel­op­ment Work­ing Pa­per in 2015. Prof Mthuli, join­ing two aca­demics, Bi­caba and Brix­iova ar­gued that a se­ri­ous com­mit­ment to elim­i­nat­ing ex­treme poverty in Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa re­quires a three-pronged ap­proach: Struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion which re­quires sta­ble macro-economic poli­cies, in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments and in­clu­sive growth pri­ori­tis­ing pro­duc­tive employment. Cau­tious re­gional in­te­gra­tion which in­vites trade and For­eign Di­rect Investment flows to sup­port re­gional growth. Im­proved global gov­er­nance that cre­ates space for mean­ing­ful rep­re­sen­ta­tion of African per­spec­tives. Sus­tained poverty re­duc­tion will re­quire growth that is not only high but of higher qual­ity, namely in­clu­sive and green, as em­pha­sised in the Ten Year Strat­egy of the African Devel­op­ment Bank. Erad­i­cat­ing ex­treme poverty for all people ev­ery­where by 2030, is the first goal among the UN Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) ex­pected to guide the post-2015 devel­op­ment agenda. Prof Mthuli and col­leagues found that while ex­treme poverty in Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa is un­likely to be erad­i­cated by 2030, it could be re­duced to very low lev­els. They be­come a bit tech­ni­cal when they as­sert that “A ‘best case’ sce­nario, as­sum­ing ac­cel­er­ated growth and re­dis­tri­bu­tion from the rich­est 10 to poor­est 40 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion, could bring the poverty rate down to around 10 per­cent of SSA pop­u­la­tion by 2030”. Given Africa’s po­ten­tial and track record, its poverty erad­i­ca­tion agenda un­der the SDGs will likely fo­cus on cre­at­ing pros­per­ity and re­duc­ing in­equal­ity. At the re­cently held Davos World Economic Fo­rum, the dis­cus­sion of re­duc­ing in­equal­ity be­came the cen­tre agenda. Per­haps the ar­gu­ment Prof Mthuli and col­leagues made in 2015 were at best aca­demic for­tune telling. In­clu­sive growth will ben­e­fit the en­tire pop­u­la­tion, in­clud­ing the poor­est. In their pa­per, Prof Mthuli and his col­leagues ask: The ques­tion is then which poli­cies can pro­duce such growth and im­prove Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa poverty out­comes? African coun­tries need to find their own path, de­pend­ing on their cir­cum­stances and pri­or­i­ties. One of the three paths they sug­gest in their can­did con­tri­bu­tion is how na­tional poli­cies can drive growth through struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion. There are two dy­nam­ics that tend to drive growth: fun­da­men­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties and struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion. In­dus­trial pol­icy-pri­ori­ti­sa­tion of high po­ten­tial sec­tors with proper in­cen­tives is in­stru­men­tal for struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion. They posit that poli­cies of suc­cess­ful coun­tries share some com­mon features, namely a sta­ble but flex­i­ble macro-economic frame­work; in­cen­tives for re­struc­tur­ing, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and mo­bil­ity; investment in phys­i­cal and hu­man cap­i­tal as well as tech­nol­ogy adop­tion; and strong in­sti­tu­tions. Per­haps the sign­ing of the Africa Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Agree­ment is quite a noble idea to ex­pe­dite the pro­cesses of elim­i­nat­ing ex­treme poverty. An­other im­por­tant les­son from Prof Mthuli Ncube in the 2015 pa­per is that macroe­co­nomic poli­cies can help fa­cil­i­tate high, sta­ble and bal­anced growth. Im­por­tant in their rec­om­men­da­tion on how poverty may be man­aged is that Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa coun­tries will need to ac­cu­mu­late suf­fi­cient re­serves dur­ing the booms to cush­ion the down­turns. Turn­ing to struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion, they ar­gue that it can drive re­duc­tion in in­equal­ity and poverty. The sources of growth clearly mat­ter for poverty re­duc­tion and in­clu­sion: new jobs need to be cre­ated in pro­duc­tive and employment-in­ten­sive sec­tors. In par­tic­u­lar, based on lessons from Latin Amer­i­can and other coun­tries suc­cess­ful in re­duc­ing poverty, growth needs to gen­er­ate pro­duc­tive jobs for large seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion. The lessons from China sug­gest that to re­duce poverty African coun­tries should fo­cus on rais­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity of agri­cul­ture, which in turn fa­cil­i­tates struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion, as man­u­fac­tur­ing ab­sorbs work­ers from ru­ral ar­eas. Equally im­por­tant, Brazil has shown that the Gov­ern­ment can help re­duce poverty through well-de­signed re­dis­tribu­tive pro­grammes and so­cial pro­tec­tion, so far miss­ing in most of Africa. The sec­ond as­pect they sub­mit is that re­gional poli­cies: Trade pol­icy and the im­por­tance of re­gional in­te­gra­tion. Re­gional in­te­gra­tion has gained mo­men­tum re­cently in sev­eral re­gional economic com­mu­ni­ties (RECs), as ev­i­denced by in­creased in­trare­gional trade and flows of for­eign di­rect investment, as well as an­nounce­ments aim­ing to for­malise the re­la­tions and bring them to higher lev­els. Suc­cess­ful re­gional in­te­gra­tion would in­deed al­low coun­tries to draw on their com­par­a­tive ad­van­tages, lead­ing to higher ef­fi­ciency and growth as well as in­te­gra­tion to global value chains, and re­duced “among coun­tries” in­equal­ity. It would also pro­vide plat­forms for col­lec­tive in­surance (for ex­am­ple against food in­se­cu­rity) and fa­cil­i­tate re­gional so­lu­tions to col­lec­tive chal­lenges such as cli­mate change. De­spite th­ese pay-offs, re­gional in­te­gra­tion, in par­tic­u­lar es­tab­lish­ments of mon­e­tary unions should not be rushed, as the ex­pe­ri­ence of the Euro zone in­di­cates. Struc­tural re­forms must suc­cess­fully ad­dress in­fra­struc­ture gaps, har­monise macro-economic out­comes, and syn­chro­nise busi­ness cy­cles be­fore fur­ther mon­e­tary in­te­gra­tion can oc­cur. Re­gional strate­gies should ini­tially fo­cus on de­vel­op­ing ar­eas of in­dus­trial com­ple­men­tar­ity to raise coun­tries’ ca­pac­ity to trade, sup­ported by build­ing re­gional in­fra­struc­ture to fa­cil­i­tate move­ment of prod­ucts, ser­vices, cap­i­tal and, last but not least, people. Last, but not least sug­ges­tion, they men­tioned that global poli­cies are ef­fec­tive in re­form­ing gov­er­nance struc­tures for in­clu­sive growth. Pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions typ­i­cally fo­cus on ac­tions, ei­ther in­di­vid­ual or col­lec­tive, of African coun­tries. Less at­ten­tion is be­ing paid to the role that global gov­er­nance should play. How are then in­flu­en­tial in­sti­tu­tions such as the G20 far­ing on sup­port­ing in­clu­sive and green growth, and hence poverty re­duc­tion, in Africa? Fol­low­ing the Seoul Con­sen­sus on Devel­op­ment in 2010, the G20 placed devel­op­ment and low-in­come coun­tries once again at the cen­tre of its post-2015 agenda. Specif­i­cally, in­clu­sive growth or rather strong, sus­tain­able, bal­anced and in­clu­sive growth has been a key ob­jec­tive of the G20 for some time. How­ever, green growth is not among the key pri­or­i­ties of the year, and grad­u­ally faded from the agenda al­ready in 2013 and 2014. Lastly, the G20 group could also bet­ter link var­i­ous devel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties such as agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity with in­fra­struc­ture and any other re­lated devel­op­ment ar­eas rather than treat­ing them as sep­a­rate is­sues. In other words, Africa needs to be well rep­re­sented, as an equal part­ner in the key pol­icy and de­ci­sion-mak­ing global struc­tures. Only a global part­ner­ship with strong African rep­re­sen­ta­tion can tackle chal­lenges as im­por­tant as elim­i­nat­ing the re­gion’s ex­treme poverty.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210126,China vows un­remit­ting fight against cor­rup­tion,"CHINA’S top dis­ci­plinary body on Sun­day adopted a com­mu­nique, vow­ing un­remit­ting ef­forts to im­prove party con­duct, build a clean gov­ern­ment and fight cor­rup­tion to en­sure the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the tar­gets and tasks set for the 14th Five-Year-Plan pe­riod (2021-2025). The com­mu­nique was adopted at the fifth ple­nary ses­sion of the 19th Cen­tral Com­mis­sion for Dis­ci­pline In­spec­tion (CCDI) of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC), which was held in Bei­jing last Fri­day to Sun­day. Xi Jin­ping, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, Chi­nese pres­i­dent and chair­man of the Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion, at­tended and ad­dressed the ses­sion. Other party and state lead­ers, in­clud­ing Li Ke­qiang, Li Zhan­shu, Wang Yang, Wang Hun­ing, Zhao Leji and Han Zheng, also at­tended the meet­ing. The ses­sion re­viewed the CCDI’s progress in 2020, laid out its tasks for 2021 and passed a work re­port de­liv­ered by Zhao on be­half of the Stand­ing Com­mit­tee of the CCDI, ac­cord­ing to the com­mu­nique. A speech made by Xi at the ses­sion was stud­ied, and it was agreed that the speech pro­vides im­por­tant guid­ance to fur­ther en­force full, rig­or­ous self-dis­ci­pline within the party. In 2020, new ma­jor achieve­ments have been made in var­i­ous ar­eas of the party and state’s cause un­der the lead­er­ship of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee with Com­rade Xi Jin­ping at the core, fully demon­strat­ing the no­table strengths of the party lead­er­ship and the sys­tem of so­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics, ac­cord­ing to the com­mu­nique. The CCDI, the Na­tional Su­per­vi­sory Com­mis­sion, and lo­cal dis­ci­pline in­spec­tion com­mis­sions and su­per­vi­sory agen­cies at all lev­els have faith­fully per­formed their du­ties in fight­ing against Covid-19, se­cur­ing a de­ci­sive vic­tory in fin­ish­ing the build­ing of a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in all re­spects and shak­ing off poverty while pro­mot­ing high-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment of the dis­ci­plinary in­spec­tion and su­per­vi­sion work, it noted. For 2021, ef­forts should be made to en­sure that of­fi­cials “don’t dare to, are un­able to and have no de­sire to com­mit acts of cor­rup­tion,” and to deepen the re­form of dis­ci­pline in­spec­tion and su­per­vi­sion sys­tems, ac­cord­ing to the com­mu­nique. An eight-point list of re­quire­ments was put for­ward by the ses­sion: 1. Up­hold Xi’s po­si­tion as the core of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and the whole party, as well as the au­thor­ity of the CPC Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and its cen­tralised, uni­fied lead­er­ship to en­sure the smooth im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 14th Five-Year-Plan with strong po­lit­i­cal over­sight; 2. Deepen the anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paign and ad­vance the sys­tem un­der which of­fi­cials “don’t dare to, are un­able to and have no de­sire to com­mit acts of cor­rup­tion” as a whole; in­ves­ti­gate cor­rup­tion cases in which po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic is­sues are in­ter­twined; 3. Beef up the fight against deep-rooted prac­tices of for­mal­i­ties for for­mal­i­ties’ sake and bu­reau­cratism; curb be­hav­iours re­lated to hedonism and ex­trav­a­gance; su­per­vise the im­ple­men­ta­tion of reg­u­la­tions re­lated to do­ing business by lead­ing of­fi­cials’ spouses, chil­dren, and their chil­dren’s spouses; 4. Ad­dress cor­rup­tion and mis­con­duct that oc­cur on the peo­ple’s doorsteps to pro­mote so­cial fair­ness and jus­tice as well as safe­guard the le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests of the peo­ple; 5. Im­prove co­or­di­na­tion in dis­ci­plinary in­spec­tions at dif­fer­ent lev­els, giv­ing full play to in­tra­party su­per­vi­sion and pub­lic over­sight; 6. In­te­grate var­i­ous forms of su­per­vi­sion and im­prove the ef­fec­tive­ness of su­per­vi­sion and gov­er­nance, in­clud­ing strength­en­ing over­sight on lead­ing bod­ies and their heads; 7. Deepen the re­form of dis­ci­pline in­spec­tion and su­per­vi­sion sys­tems and pro­mote in­tra­party and state su­per­vi­sion across the board; 8. Con­duct strict self-su­per­vi­sion and self-dis­ci­pline and build an iron anti-graft team that is loyal, clean, pro­fes­sional and with a strong sense of po­lit­i­cal in­tegrity and re­spon­si­bil­ity. — Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170626,Africa must pro­duce for the global mar­ket — Mu­denda,"AFRICA should utilise her artis­tic ex­pres­sion to tap into the $100 mil­lion global hand­i­crafts mar­ket as part of ef­forts to al­le­vi­ate poverty and em­power or­di­nary peo­ple. Speaker of Par­lia­ment Ad­vo­cate Ja­cob Mu­denda said this in Bu­l­awayo on Fri­day while ad­dress­ing del­e­gates at the of­fi­cial open­ing of the 9th edi­tion of the Co­or­di­nat­ing Com­mit­tee for the De­vel­op­ment and Pro­mo­tion of African Hand­i­crafts (Codepa). Codepa is a 26-mem­ber in­ter-African or­gan­i­sa­tion formed to de­velop and pro­mote African hand­i­crafts. Ad­vo­cate Mu­denda said Africa’s com­pet­i­tive­ness in the global mar­ket will go a long way in eras­ing the scourge of poverty in the con­ti­nent. “The global mar­ket value for handicraft is es­ti­mated to be at least $100 mil­lion with key markets be­ing the United States, Ger­many, France, the United King­dom, Spain, Nether­lands, Ja­pan and Hong Kong. “Where is the African artis­tic ex­pres­sion in this global hand­i­crafts com­pet­i­tive­ness? Let it be dis­played to erase the scourge of poverty in Africa side by side with other pro­duc­tive sec­tors in com­merce and in­dus­try,” said Adv Mu­denda. He im­plored Codepa to come up with poli­cies, which sup­port handicraft de­vel­op­ment in the con­ti­nent, adding that pro­duc­tion is presently dom­i­nated by China and In­dia as well as other Asian coun­tries yet Africa has a huge de­mo­graphic ad­van­tage. “The po­si­tion of China and In­dia is based largely on low cost, high vol­ume and west­ern de­signed goods. “Africa should be also on the lead be­cause the hand­i­crafts sec­tor is a home based in­dus­try, which re­quires min­i­mum cap­i­tal in­put and in­fra­struc­ture. “Codepa must, there­fore, de­velop poli­cies that sup­port this sec­tor in Africa. “This is a sec­tor that can be handy in ini­ti­at­ing a whole com­mu­nity into a vi­able com­mer­cial cen­tre un­der­pin­ning im­prove­ment and its liveli­hood,” said Ad­vo­cate Mu­denda. In many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, he added, the con­tri­bu­tion made to the econ­omy and the ex­port mar­ket through artis­tic ar­ti­sanry is in­creas­ing as more new crafts­peo­ple are in­tro­duced to the sec­tor. “Re­duc­ing poverty through em­ploy­ment gen­er­a­tion in the craft sec­tor should be done at pol­icy and ca­pac­ity build­ing lev­els. At pol­icy level, this re­quires im­prove­ments in do­mes­tic pol­icy in­no­va­tion and ro­bust le­gal frame­works, which will an­chor the hand­i­crafts in­dus­try. “Such a pol­icy and le­gal frame­work must im­pinge upon sus­tain­able ca­pac­ity build­ing pro­grammes meant to en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity in the sec­tor,” said Adv Mu­denda. He said mem­ber states should also en­deav­our to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment con­ducive to aes­thetic craft ap­pre­ci­a­tion. “Such in­ter­ven­tion should ad­dress the many weak­nesses noted among hand­i­crafters. These in­clude lack of for­mal struc­tures, lack of ap­pro­pri­ate ed­u­ca­tion, lim­ited cap­i­tal and ex­po­sure to new pro­duc­tion tech­nolo­gies, ab­sence of mar­ket in­tel­li­gence and lack of con­sis­tency. “This must be fol­lowed up by im­ple­ment­ing pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions that en­cour­age youth and women to en­gage in pro­fes­sional skills train­ing, which would help them in­crease pro­duc­tion,” said Adv Mu­denda. He urged de­vel­op­ment part­ners to pay at­ten­tion to gen­der eq­uity so that women could also en­joy le­gal and fi­nan­cial sup­port in their en­trepreneur­ship.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200716,"WFP, South Su­dan sign agric mas­ter­plan deal","JUBA — South Su­dan has signed an agree­ment with the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP) to help speed up agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion un­der its Com­pre­hen­sive Agri­cul­tural Mas­ter­plan (CAMP) that seeks to im­prove food se­cu­rity. Josephine Lagu Yanga, min­is­ter of Agri­cul­ture and Food Se­cu­rity, said the agree­ment signed on Tues­day with WFP would en­able the youngest na­tion to trans­form its nascent agri­cul­tural sec­tor by em­pow­er­ing small­holder farm­ers to pro­duce enough. “We are a ru­ral coun­try be­cause the ma­jor­ity of our peo­ple live in ru­ral ar­eas and it's our re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure that we lift them from ru­ral ar­eas. Other coun­tries have done it and a lot of them did through trans­form­ing their agri­cul­tural sec­tor,” she told jour­nal­ists in Juba. She urged South Su­dan to fol­low China’s blue­print on the agri­cul­tural trans­for­ma­tion that has helped lift mil­lions out of poverty. In the re­cent past the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China is one of those coun­tries that have ac­cel­er­ated tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment through agri­cul­tural rev­o­lu­tion,” Yanga said. “I al­ways men­tion this to our peo­ple that in the 1960s China was a ru­ral coun­try and they could not even feed their peo­ple, but they had an am­bi­tious pro­gramme to en­sure that they achieved food self-suf­fi­ciency for the ma­jor­ity of their peo­ple,” she added. — WOOD­LANDS Park res­i­dents in Gweru have pe­ti­tioned gov­ern­ment de­mand­ing the im­me­di­ate re­lo­ca­tion of a dump­site lo­cated close to the res­i­den­tial area.

zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20210305,"From Brazil to Turkey, food prices spike world­wide","THE world is rac­ing to vac­ci­nate its way out of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, but an­other chal­lenge has al­ready emerged for some more vul­ner­a­ble gov­ern­ments and economies. Global food prices are at the high­est in more than six years, driven by a jump in the cost of ev­ery­thing from soy­abean to palm oil be­cause of de­mand from China, vul­ner­a­ble sup­ply chains and ad­verse weather. Some banks warn the world is head­ing into a com­modi­ties “su­per­cy­cle.” In­fla­tion is putting an­other squeeze on con­sumers hurt­ing from pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion and—in some places — fall­ing cur­ren­cies. Since the start of the year, protests have raged in Su­dan, while anx­i­eties over se­cur­ing food con­trib­uted to strife in Le­banon and Tu­nisia, ground zero for the Arab Spring up­ris­ings a decade ago. In In­dia, farm­ers re­volted against ef­forts to bring prices down. Rus­sia and Ar­gentina have re­stricted crop ship­ments to sup­press prices at home. Even rich coun­tries like the United Arab Emi­rates are con­sid­er­ing pos­si­ble price caps on some foods. “These price spikes are desta­bil­is­ing, not just be­cause they in­duce a lot of hard­ship on com­mu­ni­ties and house­holds, but also be­cause there is this ex­pec­ta­tion that the gov­ern­ment will do some­thing about it,” said Cullen Hen­drix, non-res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nom­ics, a Washington-based think tank. “The im­pli­ca­tions are go­ing to last longer and be­yond the pan­demic.” As ever, the im­pact is dis­pro­por­tion­ate. In rich West­ern coun­tries, it might just be a case of switch­ing prod­uct brand. In the poor­est na­tions, it can mean the dif­fer­ence be­tween send­ing a child to school or out to earn money. Yet it’s in the largest mid­dle-in­come coun­tries where the ef­fects may res­onate most for the world. They are some of the most pop­u­lous places on the planet and where food costs make up a larger share of con­sumer price bas­kets. They are also where gov­ern­ments are un­der more pres­sure to act. Brazil: Pop­ulist pres­sure Latin Amer­ica’s big­gest econ­omy stands out among emerg­ing mar­kets for hav­ing the fastest in­crease in food prices in the past year rel­a­tive to over­all in­fla­tion be­cause of a sus­tained de­cline in the cur­rency, ac­cord­ing to Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics Ltd. Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro’s pop­u­lar­ity is fall­ing to near record lows and he’s try­ing to find new ways to mol­lify the elec­torate. On Feb. 19, he abruptly re­moved the head of the state-con­trolled oil com­pany af­ter a row over fuel prices. He also has been push­ing for a new round of coro­n­avirus aid to the poor af­ter cash hand­outs ended in De­cem­ber. The trou­ble is that the money served to push up food prices, ac­cord­ing to Maria An­dreia Lameiras, a re­searcher at the eco­nom­ics re­search in­sti­tute Ipea. Rice jumped 76 per­cent last year, while milk and beef soared by more than 20 per­cent. “The gov­ern­ment dis­pensed money to the pop­u­la­tion with the high­est ex­pen­di­tures on food,” Lameiras said. The cost of se­cur­ing vi­tal nu­tri­tion threat­ens to widen in­equal­ity in a coun­try with the big­gest in­come gap in the re­gion, a sit­u­a­tion that’s only been ex­ac­er­bated by the pan­demic. Even if the aid re­turns, the monthly pay­ment would be lower and reach fewer peo­ple, lim­it­ing its scope to mit­i­gate ex­treme poverty. Rus­sia: His­tory les­son Mem­o­ries of soar­ing prices and empty shelves in the af­ter­math of the Soviet Union’s col­lapse are still vivid for many Rus­sians. With his pop­u­lar­ity barely back from nadirs and protests de­mand­ing the re­lease of jailed op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin is wary of the po­lit­i­cal im­pact of food costs. In re­cent weeks, the world’s No. 1 wheat ex­porter im­posed tar­iffs and quo­tas de­signed to curb sales abroad and drive do­mes­tic prices lower. Rus­sia’s largest re­tail­ers were also or­dered to freeze some food prices, with po­ta­toes and car­rots up by more than a third from last year. But such lim­its could back­fire and end up fu­elling over­all in­fla­tion. The Au­dit Cham­ber, a gov­ern­ment watch­dog, es­ti­mated in Jan­uary that food prices over­all will jump when the re­stric­tions are lifted at the end of March. “Rus­sia may see some real po­lit­i­cal mo­bil­i­sa­tion around food prices,” said Hen­drix. “Au­thor­i­tar­ian gov­ern­ments tend to be some­what more per­mis­sive of these types of “kitchen ta­ble is­sue” protests than they are of more gen­eral cam­paigns against cor­rup­tion and au­thor­i­tar­ian rule. Though, as the Arab Spring demon­strated, the for­mer can be­come the lat­ter—some­times very quickly.” Nige­ria: Per­fect storm Food prices in Africa’s big­gest econ­omy make up for more than half the coun­try’s in­fla­tion in­dex and rose at the fastest pace in more than 12 years in Jan­uary. An av­er­age Nige­rian house­hold spends more than 50 per­cent of its bud­get on food. The costs are adding to a per­fect storm of food se­cu­rity chal­lenges that have haunted Nige­ria through­out the pan­demic. For­eign cur­rency re­serves needed to im­port goods dried up af­ter a plunge in oil prices. Sup­ply bot­tle­necks and at­tacks on farm­ers have also weighed on sup­ply of agri­cul­tural goods. There were also short­ages of sta­ples such as rice af­ter the au­thor­i­ties re­stricted im­ports and closed land borders for 16 months. They re­opened in De­cem­ber, but that has done lit­tle to ease in­fla­tion. Food-re­lated griev­ances played a role in sus­tain­ing the #EndSARS protests in the fall. What first started as demon­stra­tions against po­lice bru­tal­ity un­der Pres­i­dent Muham­madu Buhari turned into loot­ing of ware­houses stor­ing such things as noo­dles, rice and pasta. Turkey: An­gry leader As the world’s big­gest per-capita con­sumer of bread and its top flour ex­porter, Turkey is par­tic­u­larly ex­posed to a rally in com­mod­ity mar­kets. Food prices rose 18per­cent in Jan­uary from a year ear­lier, with sharp jumps in sta­ples from grains to veg­eta­bles. Turkey has grap­pled with a dou­ble-digit food in­fla­tion for years, but the po­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions for Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan are in­creas­ing as food costs hit his core sup­port base along with the plunge in the value of the lira. Er­do­gan or­dered an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the in­crease in food prices. He said oil, pulses, veg­eta­bles and fruits were the “pri­mary con­cern.” The Trade Min­istry may im­pose fines on busi­nesses that sell food prod­ucts at high prices, the pres­i­dent warned in Jan­uary. The trou­ble is that gov­ern­ment threats and fi­nan­cial penal­ties in 2019 barely moved the nee­dle. For­tune.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20200821,Re­view of the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme I,"Gov­ern­ment is in the process of craft­ing a Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy (NDS), that will run from 2021 to 2025. The NDS will re­place the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP), which was launched on Oc­to­ber 5, 2018, and is run­ning un­til De­cem­ber 2020. It is vi­tal to take stock of the TSP in terms of its suc­cesses, chal­lenges and key lessons. The fo­cal ar­eas of the TSP in­clude: sta­bil­is­ing the macro-econ­omy, and the fi­nan­cial sec­tor; in­tro­duc­ing nec­es­sary pol­icy, and in­sti­tu­tional re­forms, to trans­form to a pri­vate sec­tor led econ­omy; and launch­ing quick-wins to stim­u­late growth. The TSP is un­der­pinned by Vi­sion 2030: To­wards an Upper Mid­dle-In­come Coun­try. A ma­jor cri­tique of the TSP is that there were no ef­fec­tive con­sul­ta­tions and di­a­logue with key stake­hold­ers to reach a con­sen­sus and to achieve buy-in and sup­port. A ma­jor rea­son for pol­icy still­birth and fail­ure is the lack of ef­fec­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion by key stake­hold­ers and the cit­i­zens in pol­icy for­mu­la­tion. De­vel­op­ment is not a top down ap­proach, but rather a bot­tomup ap­proach. This is key to en­sure that no one is left be­hind. The TSP is also based on shock ther­apy (a big bang struc­tural ad­just­ment ap­proach). Such an ap­proach is, how­ever, not de­sir­able for a coun­try like Zim­babwe, that has se­ri­ous ca­pac­ity con­straints in a num­ber of ar­eas. De­vel­op­men­tal wel­fare states adopt a se­quen­tial and grad­u­al­ist ap­proach that fo­cus on at­tack­ing the most bind­ing con­straints to de­vel­op­ment in­cre­men­tally, rather than try­ing to ad­dress many con­straints si­mul­ta­ne­ously. In the words of Ro­drik (2007), “de­vel­op­ment suc­cess re­quires not a ‘big bang’ ap­proach, but, rather, a se­lec­tive, se­quen­tial, and of­ten unortho­dox ap­proach that ac­counts for coun­try-spe­cific cir­cum­stances. The TSP en­vis­aged over­all real GDP growth per­cent­age of 6,3 (in 2018); 9,0% (in 2019); and 9,7% (in 2020). While the TSP has clear eco­nomic growth tar­gets there are no ex­plicit tar­gets on employment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. The TSP is there­fore not based on a holis­tic ap­proach to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment that in­te­grates eco­nomic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­per­a­tives and con­sid­er­a­tions. The TSP is there­fore pred­i­cated on the un­der­ly­ing con­ven­tional macro­eco­nomics as­sump­tion of “trickle down” that once eco­nomic growth is at­tained that will au­to­mat­i­cally re­sult in employment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. Also given that fu­ture eco­nomic growth is pro­jected to be un­der­pinned by the nat­u­ral re­source sec­tors (in par­tic­u­lar min­ing) it is highly un­likely that a lot of employment op­por­tu­ni­ties would be cre­ated owing to high cap­i­tal in­ten­sity. Such a pro­jected growth pat­tern will also likely re­sult in many peo­ple be­ing left be­hind and left out of the growth dy­namic. In terms of macroe­co­nomic per­for­mance, the over­all real GDP growth tar­gets for 2018 and 2019 were missed. In 2018, the econ­omy only grew by 3,4% against a TSP tar­get of 6,3%, while in 2019, the econ­omy de­clined by -6,5% against a TSP tar­get of 9%. e eco­nomic growth tar­get for 2020 will also be missed with the World Bank pro­ject­ing eco­nomic de­cline of -10% for 2020 against the TSP tar­get of 9,7% owing to the Covid-19 pan­demic among other fac­tors. Like­wise, the in­fla­tion tar­gets for 2018 and 2019 were missed. The tar­get for 2020 is also likely to be missed with the IMF pro­ject­ing an av­er­age an­nual in­fla­tion of 221% for 2020. Rev­enues (% of GDP) fared be­low tar­geted per­for­mance in both 2018 and 2019 on ac­count of the eco­nomic slow­down. How­ever, the ex­pen­di­tures (% of GDP) tar­gets for both 2018 and 2019 were achieved. This re­sulted in the coun­try at­tain­ing a bud­get deficit (% of GDP) of -5,3% in 2018 against a tar­get of -9% and a bud­get sur­plus (% of GDP) of 0,6% in 2019 against a tar­get of -5,2%. The coun­try also at­tained a pos­i­tive cur­rent ac­count bal­ance (% of GDP) of 0,41% in 2018. The Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness mantra has shown an ob­vi­ous bias to­wards at­tract­ing For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment (FDI). Em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence and case stud­ies from both de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries have, how­ever, shown that mi­cro, small and medium en­ter­prises (MSME s) have the great­est po­ten­tial of cre­at­ing employment and con­tribut­ing to gross do­mes­tic out­put (GDP) if well har­nessed and sup­ported by a con­ducive pol­icy, reg­u­la­tory and in­sti­tu­tional frame­work. MSME s also have great po­ten­tial of be­ing suc­cess­fully linked with lo­cal, re­gional and global value chains. In China, for in­stance, the Town­ship and Vil­lage En­ter­prises (TVEs) have un­der­pinned the Chi­nese growth suc­cess story. Gov­ern­ment must there­fore adopt an ac­tive bias to­wards sup­port­ing and fa­cil­i­tat­ing lo­cal busi­nesses and in­vest­ments. For for­eign in­vest­ments to thrive they must be an­chored by a strong and thriv­ing lo­cal busi­ness sec­tor. In fact, for­eign in­vest­ment must com­ple­ment and not sup­ple­ment lo­cal in­vest­ment. Un­derem­ploy­ment and in­for­mal employment are wide­spread in the coun­try, with large num­bers of peo­ple in­volved in pre­car­i­ous and vul­ner­a­ble employment. Most of the employment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Zim­babwe are in the in­for­mal econ­omy, which is char­ac­terised by low pro­duc­tiv­ity and poor work­ing con­di­tions. Ac­cord­ing to the 2019 Labour Force and Child Labour Sur­vey, 75,6% of to­tal employment is in­for­mal. The high level of in­for­mal­ity also presents chal­lenges for do­mes­tic re­sources mo­bil­i­sa­tion, as it has eroded the tax base. One rea­son for the high lev­els of in­for­mal­ity is the oner­ous and dis­tor­tionary tax regime (there are so many taxes, levies, statu­tory fees and other un­of­fi­cial charges through cor­rup­tion which in­crease the over­all cost of do­ing busi­ness). This has dis­cour­aged for­mal­i­sa­tion, while se­ri­ously erod­ing com­pet­i­tive­ness. It has been demon­strated in em­pir­i­cal lit­er­a­ture and coun­try case stud­ies that hav­ing so many taxes and levies en­cour­ages tax eva­sion and forces small busi­nesses to go or re­main, in­for­mal. It has also been shown that tax com­pli­ance rises as tax rates fall. A ma­jor chal­lenge for cre­at­ing de­cent employment op­por­tu­ni­ties is the chal­leng­ing do­ing busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and reg­u­la­tory frame­work. Es­ti­mates from En­ter­prise Sur­veys for the African con­ti­nent re­veal that about 1,3 to three mil­lion jobs are lost ev­ery year owing to ad­min­is­tra­tive hur­dles, cor­rup­tion, in­ad­e­quate in­fra­struc­ture, poor tax ad­min­is­tra­tion, and other red tape. This fig­ure is close to 20% of the new en­trants to the labour force ev­ery year. Do­ing busi­ness re­forms aimed at sim­pli­fy­ing and stream­lin­ing the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment are vi­tal to re­al­is­ing the full the po­ten­tial of the pri­vate sec­tor to cre­ate de­cent job op­por­tu­ni­ties. It is nec­es­sary and de­sir­able to re­think the cur­rent con­ven­tional macro-eco­nomic thrust. Con­ven­tional macro-eco­nomic pol­icy frame­work in­or­di­nately fo­cusses on the at­tain­ment of macro-eco­nomic sta­bil­ity as an end in it­self, at the ex­pense of employment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. It has been ob­served in many coun­tries that, ob­ses­sion with elim­i­nat­ing fis­cal and cur­rent ac­count deficits, if achieved through cut­backs in public ex­pen­di­ture, es­pe­cially on de­vel­op­ment and so­cial ser­vices, can re­tard the process of growth and re­sult in an in­crease in poverty. It is vi­tal to en­sure that fu­ture macro-eco­nomic and de­vel­op­ment poli­cies are based on the fol­low­ing prin­ci­ples: the adop­tion of a holis­tic ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment, in­te­grat­ing eco­nomic and so­cial im­per­a­tives; en­sur­ing that ex­plicit employment and poverty tar­gets are main­streamed in all the macroe­co­nomic and de­vel­op­ment poli­cies. Employment cre­ation is very im­por­tant in the fight against poverty, as it pro­vides an im­por­tant link be­tween eco­nomic growth and poverty re­duc­tion; and re­build­ing and strength­en­ing the role of the state as a ba­sis for trans­form­ing it into a de­vel­op­men­tal wel­fare state. A de­vel­op­men­tal wel­fare state, there­fore, is a state which ac­tively in­vests in the well-be­ing of its cit­i­zens, as well as boost­ing the ca­pac­ity of its econ­omy. It pri­ori­tises in­vest­ments in both so­cial and phys­i­cal cap­i­tal. The de­vel­op­men­tal wel­fare State puts its peo­ple and their wel­fare first in the de­vel­op­ment process. An im­por­tant fea­ture that char­ac­terises a de­vel­op­men­tal wel­fare state is rel­a­tively low lev­els of cor­rup­tion, state cap­ture, pa­tron­age and rent seek­ing ten­den­cies. —",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200615,Po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism alone is not enough to counter racism,"THE United States of Amer­ica (USA) is in the midst of two crises; the COVID-19 pan­demic and anti-racism protests trig­gered by the mur­der of Ge­orge Floyd, an African Amer­i­can, by a white po­lice of­fi­cer. In the last three weeks, the protests have brought to the fore the de­bate on racism. Racism is the be­lief that some racial groups are more su­pe­rior over oth­ers. This is char­ac­terised by racial prej­u­dice, dis­crim­i­na­tion, or an­tag­o­nism di­rected against other peo­ple be­cause they are of a dif­fer­ent race or eth­nic­ity. Modern vari­ants of racism are of­ten based on so­cial per­cep­tions of bi­o­log­i­cal and eco­nomic dif­fer­ences be­tween peo­ples. It re­quires more time and space to pro­vide a de­tailed so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal anal­y­sis of how race and other prej­u­dices such a xeno­pho­bia, nepo­tism and trib­al­ism man­i­fest in so­ci­eties. For pur­poses of this in­stal­ment, I will briefly dis­cuss op­tions avail­able to black peo­ple to re­deem their dig­nity among other races and try to ex­plain why po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism alone is not enough to achieve racial re­spect. Be­fore do­ing so, let us look at how races are ranked and fac­tors in­flu­enc­ing that. A re­cent study in the United States of Amer­ica ranks whites at the top, fol­lowed by Asians, fol­lowed by na­tive Amer­i­cans and His­pan­ics with blacks at the bot­tom end of the ladder. There are var­i­ous ex­pla­na­tions given for this rank­ing. Some of th­ese in­clude that slav­ery con­tin­ues to have an im­pact on black peo­ple’s sta­tus and that the poverty in Africa, the ori­gins of black peo­ple con­tin­ues to cast a dark shadow on how black peo­ple are per­ceived no mat­ter how suc­cess­ful some of them are. The lat­ter ex­pla­na­tion sug­gests that the state of the econ­omy of a race’s place of ori­gin de­ter­mines how the peo­ple of that race are per­ceived, ranked and re­spected. Just like most African coun­tries, China, In­dia and other Asian coun­tries were once colonised in var­i­ous ways at dif­fer­ent stages of his­tory. Both China and In­dia un­shack­led them­selves from this colo­nial past to be­come global eco­nomic pow­er­houses. Their big economies have earned their peo­ple global recog­ni­tion, re­spect and a pos­i­tive per­cep­tion for their races. In other words, even their poor­est peo­ple are no longer seen as sym­bols of poverty or prob­lems but op­por­tu­ni­ties be­cause of strong economies in their coun­tries of ori­gin. It is for this rea­son that a poor In­dian or Chi­nese is gen­er­ally per­ceived as a po­ten­tial in­vestor and treated bet­ter abroad, while a well-up or ed­u­cated African is seen as a job seeker, mi­grant or crim­i­nal and, there­fore, a prob­lem. Th­ese per­cep­tions also af­fect ac­cess to eco­nomic re­sources and op­por­tu­ni­ties which can be seen as racism. In a con­text where economies are shrink­ing, racial ten­sions and ha­tred tend to flare up. This takes us back to the same de­bate that de­vel­op­ing Africa is not only about im­prov­ing the lives of its peo­ple but giv­ing global re­spect, recog­ni­tion and dig­nity to its race. It is for this rea­son I ar­gue that po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism alone with­out the back­ing of thriv­ing economies in Africa is fu­tile in ad­dress­ing racism against black peo­ple. In the eyes of the ‘’world” we rep­re­sent prob­lems. Ef­forts to change racial per­cep­tions must con­sider that colo­nial­ism and slav­ery were about con­trol­ling the African’s mind in or­der to ac­cess free or cheap raw ma­te­ri­als and labour. To achieve that, they re-con­fig­ured the African mind­set by emp­ty­ing them of their knowl­edge, iden­tity, cul­ture, self-con­fi­dence and ev­ery­thing that de­fine them. They were then filled with a new iden­tity — one of in­ad­e­quacy, a new men­tal­ity that can­not thrive with­out its slave mas­ter, a new cul­ture – one of in­fe­ri­or­ity that wor­ships any­thing West­ern. It is partly be­cause of this ac­cul­tur­a­tion that some Africans as­pire to be white or to be ac­cepted within the ”white men” spheres be­cause they think they now qual­ify to be ”black white peo­ple”. And this is partly the equal­ity they have been fight­ing for and a rea­son why some Africans strug­gle to move on, let go or to de­cide on a course of ac­tion. That we hold grudges with the West for en­slav­ing and colonis­ing us while we con­tin­u­ously lobby for their aid and protest to be as­sim­i­lated in their ”sphere” char­ac­terises our con­fu­sion. We are try­ing to get over an abu­sive ex-spouse by protest­ing to get un­der that same per­son. There lies the chal­lenge with po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism in that it seeks equal racial treat­ment and ac­cess to the ex­ist­ing eco­nomic ”cake”. No mat­ter the size of the econ­omy, it is never enough to share with races his­tor­i­cally seen as slaves. In ad­di­tion, cap­i­tal­ism of­fers noth­ing for free sim­ply be­cause the cap­i­tal, which forms the econ­omy is pri­vately-owned and can­not be shared but op­por­tu­ni­ties aris­ing from the econ­omy such as jobs can be shared un­der pre­scribed con­di­tions. Those who own the means of pro­duc­tion will al­ways want more, set the terms and re­sist ef­forts to turn the ta­bles up­side down. How­ever, with African States at­tain­ing in­de­pen­dence and the rise of egal­i­tar­i­an­ism, there is an­other op­tion of turn­ing the sit­u­a­tion up­side down with­out nec­es­sar­ily turn­ing the ta­bles up­side down. This is what Africans need to do if they are to earn re­spect and their place in this un­fair world. For that we can draw in­spi­ra­tion from China, Ja­pan, Mauritius, some Mid­dle East­ern coun­tries and oth­ers that have grown their economies with­out nec­es­sar­ily protest­ing to be in­te­grated and ac­cepted into the West­ern economies. Lessons drawn from th­ese ex­am­ples are that coun­tries can rise from the ef­fects of coloni­sa­tion, cut ties with their for­mer colo­nial masters and grow their economies by mak­ing the best use of their lo­cal re­sources with lim­ited or no ex­ter­nal help in­stead of whin­ing and pin­ing over his­tor­i­cal in­jus­tices. In short, cit­i­zens whose coun­tries have grown their own ”eco­nomic cakes” earn re­spect and dig­nity out­side their bor­ders. This is the fastest and most sus­tain­able way of con­fronting racism — putting your race at the same eco­nomic foot­ing with the rest.",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160303,"West treats Zim un­fairly, says China","THE re­cip­ro­cal State visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping last year was meant to re­as­sure Zim­babwe of the Asian coun­try’s readi­ness to as­sist it, an of­fi­cial has said. Speak­ing to African jour­nal­ists on a 10-month study here un­der the China Africa Press Cen­tre on Tues­day, Chi­nese di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Depart­ment of African Affairs Mr Lin Song­tian said Zim­babwe was be­ing treated un­fairly by the West. “Pres­i­dent Xi vis­ited Zim­babwe last year to re­as­sure peo­ple that we stand by that coun­try,” he said. “The State visit was car­ried out be­fore the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion Sum­mit in Jo­han­nes­burg (South Africa) which was im­por­tant.” Mr Lin said the West started la­belling Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe a dic­ta­tor af­ter he em­barked on land re­form, which sought to pro­mote equal­ity. “You see, be­fore 2000, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe was loved by the West, but when he started re­dis­tribut­ing land to the peo­ple to them he be­came a dic­ta­tor,” he said. “Things started dis­ap­pear­ing from su­per­mar­ket shelves and there was noth­ing. Now, Zim­babwe is on the re­cov­ery path, strug­gling, fall­ing and ris­ing up.” China signed mega deals with Zim­babwe worth bil­lions of dol­lars in dif­fer­ent sec­tors when Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe vis­ited the Asian coun­try in 2014. More deals were signed dur­ing Pres­i­dent Xi’s re­cip­ro­cal State visit last year. Deals in ar­eas such as in­fra­struc­ture, en­ergy and power gen­er­a­tion, agri­cul­ture and trade are at var­i­ous stages of im­ple­men­ta­tion. Ear­lier on, Mr Lin had given the jour­nal­ists ◆ a lecture ti­tled: “In­tro­duc­tion to Sino-African Re­la­tions and Co­op­er­a­tion” where he re­it­er­ated China’s com­mit­ment to help­ing Africa. He said a num­ber of African coun­tries needed to put their house in or­der for help from China to be­come rel­e­vant. “In Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, not ev­ery coun­try is ready,” he said. “En­abling laws and reg­u­la­tions must be put in place and there must be ef­fi­ciency. “When China goes to Africa, please be as­sured that we have learnt our lessons to en­hance the coun­tries’ Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct and cre­ate jobs. “We are not go­ing there to loot re­sources. In the next three years, Sino-Africa re­la­tions will be at a higher level with more com­pa­nies go­ing there to in­vest and help cre­ate wealth. “We will share with you ev­ery­thing about our ex­pe­ri­ences.” Mr Lin said Africa needed help in three ar­eas of prov­ing in­fra­struc­ture, es­pe­cially for wa­ter and elec­tric­ity sup­ply, fund­ing and pro­fes­sion­als. He said Africa had a great po­ten­tial “to ex­plode” eco­nom­i­cally given the re­sources at its dis­posal. “China views Africa as a strate­gic part­ner,” he said. “China hopes to see that the re­la­tions are pro­found and sus­tain­able. They should be based on mu­tual trust to ben­e­fit each other eco­nom­i­cally. “We shall sup­port each other for peace and have unity with each other.” Mr Lin said China was do­ing its best to take its cit­i­zens out of poverty, hop­ing to en­sure 70 mil­lion peo­ple out of 200 mil­lion live out of the poverty da­tum line in the next five years. China has a pop­u­la­tion of nearly 1,4 bil­lion. Mr Lin said the Asian coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment was be­ing made pos­si­ble be­cause of sta­bil­ity and unity. De­liv­er­ing the first lecture to the African jour­nal­ists on Mon­day ti­tled: “Un­der­stand­ing of Chi­nese Political Sys­tem” at Ren­min Univer­sity, Pro­fes­sor Wang Yi­wei said the coun­try had a long his­tory of progress be­cause of its dis­ci­pline in pol­i­tics. He said China’s ap­proach was based on col­lec­tivism, com­pared to in­di­vid­u­al­ism as demon­strated by Western coun­tries. “In China we un­der­stand the dif­fer­ences be­tween the two,” he said. “We be­lieve in our sys­tem of a One Party State where there is de­lib­er­a­tive democ­racy where peo­ple are united for their views. “The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party is the dom­i­nant force and the most im­por­tant chal­lenge for govern­ment is to deal with the flood (prob­lems).

That should see our pace of vac­ci­nat­ing thus draw­ing us nearer the goal of achiev­ing herd im­mu­nity. “The ultimate goal is re­turn to our nor­mal lives so our chil­dren can go back to school and that we all re­sume our col­lec­tive ef­forts to­wards re­cov­ery and grow­ing our econ­omy for the re­al­i­sa­tion of vi­sion 2030. There­fore, the vac­cines roll­out pro­gramme will be an­nounced by the Min­is­ter of Health and Child Care Let me take this op­por­tu­nity to re­mind you to re­main vig­i­lant, fo­cused and con­tinue to ad­here to all the lock­down mea­sures. The health of our na­tion de­pends on us all,” he said. To tackle the pan­demic, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has as­sured the na­tion that no re­source will be spared to save the lives of Zimbabweans as Gov­ern­ment sets the tar­get of in­oc­u­lat­ing 60 per­cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion. The vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme that is ex­pected to be rolled-out soon will be on a vol­un­tary ba­sis with Gov­ern­ment bear­ing all the costs. WHILE the level four na­tional lock­down con­tin­ues for an­other two weeks, to en­sure that the sig­nif­i­cant progress seen in the last few weeks in re­duc­ing in­fec­tion and death rates con­tin­ues, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa yes­ter­day did start the process of a care­ful and highly-con­trolled re-open­ing of the many sec­tors of the econ­omy that have been shut. This al­lows Gov­ern­ment to meet its dou­ble re­spon­si­bil­ity of mak­ing sure that the econ­omy can con­tinue to func­tion, but with­out killing large num­bers of peo­ple. While in­fec­tion rates are fall­ing, they are still high enough that any ma­jor and sud­den re­lax­ation could eas­ily see them es­ca­late rapidly again, as we saw in De­cem­ber. So the Pres­i­dent had to be cau­tious. Through­out the level four lock­down reim­posed early last month, the pro­duc­tive sec­tors of farm­ing, min­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing were al­lowed to con­tinue op­er­at­ing, along with es­sen­tial ser­vices, since th­ese op­er­a­tions are not open to vis­i­tors and cus­tomers from the gen­eral pub­lic and it is easy for those in charge of th­ese op­er­a­tions to en­force health rules in con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments. And those in charge jus­ti­fied the trust that the Pres­i­dent and his health au­thor­i­ties placed in them, while at the same time the over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of cit­i­zens started tak­ing the per­sonal health pre­cau­tions of mask­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and per­sonal hy­giene far more se­ri­ously. The care­ful fur­ther re­lax­ations are now jus­ti­fied so long as busi­ness own­ers and the gen­eral pub­lic con­tinue to co-op­er­ate. Busi­ness hours have been ad­justed to 8am to 5pm, the nor­mal work­ing day. This re­moves a ma­jor con­straint faced in many pro­duc­tive sec­tors. The cur­few has been mod­i­fied in turn to give peo­ple two-and-a-half hours to get to work and three hours to pack up af­ter work and then get home. It will also re­duce queu­ing at su­per­mar­kets and phar­ma­cies. Pri­vate busi­nesses are now al­lowed to ap­ply for per­mis­sion to open, but have to test all staff and op­er­ate un­der any con­di­tions that may be im­posed if their ap­pli­ca­tion is suc­cess­ful. The lead­er­ship given by fac­tory own­ers shows that re­spon­si­ble busi­ness own­ers can op­er­ate safely, but this needs to be dis­played. The in­for­mal sec­tor, where so many earn a liv­ing, has al­ways been a par­tic­u­lar prob­lem al­though this need not be the case if those in­volved are will­ing to co­op­er­ate in both the spirit and the letter of the law. The Pres­i­dent made it crys­tal clear that while the in­for­mal sec­tor can re­sume, it can only do so once those in­volved have sat­is­fied the pro­to­cols set by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. In some cases this is rel­a­tively easy. We have ma­jor mar­ket com­plexes whose own­ers, even dur­ing the re­laxed con­di­tions of De­cem­ber, were in­sis­tent on mask­ing, sani­tis­ing, tem­per­a­ture test­ing, con­trolled ac­cess, and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. They should be able to gear up fairly quickly. In other cases there needs to be a far more se­ri­ously com­mit­ment to the WHO pro­to­cols than we have seen be­fore. It is largely up to those in­volved to prove they can fol­low sen­si­ble rules and ad­vice. In­ter­est­ingly, some of the il­le­gal vend­ing done dur­ing the in­ten­si­fied lock­down has seen a se­ri­ous at­tempt to con­form to at least some rules, such as mask­ing, hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Par­ties and so­cial gath­er­ings sim­ply re­main banned, ex­cept for con­trolled fu­ner­als with less than 30 peo­ple. This was the eas­i­est call for the Pres­i­dent to make. No one will be harmed if they can­not have a party or a big gath­er­ing. As Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has con­tin­u­ally stressed, we have to be very care­ful in­deed un­til a large ma­jor­ity of peo­ple are vac­ci­nated. Yes­ter­day the first 200 000 doses of vac­cine ar­rived as a gift from China, enough for 100 000 peo­ple, and China has given us a high po­si­tion in the queue to buy an­other 600 000 doses for de­liv­ery next month. The Pres­i­dent’s heartfelt thanks to China are jus­ti­fied. That coun­try has its own pro­gramme, and vac­ci­nat­ing 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple is ob­vi­ously a huge un­der­tak­ing. To what amounts to a di­ver­sion of doses to a coun­try far away shows a real com­mit­ment to both friend­ship and global re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, es­pe­cially as this is be­ing done so early in the Chi­nese na­tional vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme. Gov­ern­ment has been ac­tive with other sup­pli­ers, and we are in line for vac­cines fairly soon from Rus­sia, In­dia and our share of the fa­cil­i­ties ar­ranged by WHO and the African Union. As with ev­ery other coun­try, it will take months to vac­ci­nate a suf­fi­ciently large pro­por­tion of our pop­u­la­tion, but at least we are now start­ing. But we have to live and work very care­fully. We have pushed back the se­cond wave, but we still have too many peo­ple fall­ing sick each day to even think of low­er­ing our guard. The mod­est re­lax­ations an­nounced by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa yes­ter­day are, in many re­spects, a sign that he trusts us to be sen­si­ble and care­ful, a trust in what he ac­knowl­edged as our good sense al­ready in the en­hanced lock­down. Gov­ern­ment can­not do ev­ery­thing it­self. It needs the whole pop­u­la­tion to co­op­er­ate. Health ex­perts can give the guide­lines and the tech­ni­cal ad­vice. Un­less we all take those guide­lines to heart, we can so eas­ily re­turn to the lev­els of in­fec­tion and death we saw just four weeks ago, and then get worse still. The care­ful step-by-step re­lax­ation an­nounced by the Pres­i­dent is the ob­vi­ous way for­ward, and the daily in­fec­tion rates and other fig­ures, plus the en­hanced test­ing, mean that if there is any prob­lem we can retreat quickly. MI­AMI. — Nicki Mi­naj’s fa­ther Robert Maraj has died in a hit and run ac­ci­dent over the week­end at the age of 64. The “Su­per­bass” hit­maker’s dad Robert Maraj passed away when he was struck by a car be­tween Roslyn Road and Raff Av­enue in Nas­sau County, New York. It has been re­ported by TMZ that the ve­hi­cle – which was head­ing north­bound at the time – and its driver fled the scene. The ac­ci­dent hap­pened on Fri­day evening, and he was taken to a lo­cal hos­pi­tal and passed away over the week­end from his in­juries, with a rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Nicki con­firm­ing her fa­ther’s pass­ing. Nicki re­cently be­came a par­ent her­self, wel­com­ing a baby boy into the world. The “Ana­conda” hit­maker and her hus­band, Ken­neth ‘Zoo’ Petty, wel­comed their first child into the world in Oc­to­ber last year Post­ing on Instagram to thank all those who sent her well wishes af­ter giv­ing birth, she wrote: “Thank you to Queen B, Kim & Ye, Ric­cardo Tisci, Win­nie, Karol & ev­ery­one who sent well wishes dur­ing this time. “It meant the world to me. I am so grate­ful & in love with my son. Madly in love. My fa­vorite liddo boy in the whole wide world. Nicki re­vealed her preg­nancy back in July with a se­ries of Instagram posts show­ing off her baby bump, one of which was cap­tioned “#preg­gers”. The “Chun Li” rap­per fi rst sparked spec­u­la­tion about her preg­nancy in May af­ter dis­cussing her food crav­ings and feel­ings of “nau­sea”. Nicki listed the bizarre food com­bi­na­tions she had been cook­ing up, and said that, she felt sick and had been go­ing to the toi­let more of­ten than usual. When one fan asked her if she had been cook­ing any­thing in re­cent weeks, she said: “Ab­so­lutely. Steak. Shrimp. Plus my fa­mous cheese­burg­ers. So good. Been rlly hav­ing red meat crav­ings then salad crav­ings with ex­tra jalapeños. Or­dered Chkn na­chos that didn’t come w/jalapeños. Who does that? Wow. An­other fan then picked up on her com­ments and asked her: “Are you also throw­ing up in morn­ing and hav­ing to go to the bath­room a lot?” To which she replied: “Lmao. No throw­ing up. But nau­sea and pee­ing non stop. Omg what do u think this means guys? — THE African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) through its ’Af­fir­ma­tive Fi­nance Ac­tion for Women in Africa (AFAWA) ini­tia­tive has part­nered with the African Guar­an­tee Fund to un­lock be­tween US$1,3 bil­lion and US$2 bil­lion in loans for the con­ti­nent’s women-owned Small to Medium En­ter­prises. AfDB said the move sig­nals the launch of AFAWA’s Guar­an­tee for Growth (G4G) pro­gramme, which seeks to make avail­able up to US$3 bil­lion in fi­nanc­ing for women en­trepreneurs through de-risk­ing and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance mea­sures. “The AfDB’s Af­fir­ma­tive Fi­nance Ac­tion for Women in Africa (AFAWA) pro­gramme has agreed a partnership with the African Guar­an­tee Fund (AGF) to un­lock US$1,3 to US$2 bil­lion in loans to women-owned small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in Africa, by work­ing with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to en­hance their abil­ity to lend to women,” said the regional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion. Al­ready, fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in coun­tries such as Cameroon, Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Tan­za­nia and Uganda have signed on to the pro­gramme. As the im­ple­ment­ing part­ner of AFAWA’s G4G pro­gramme, the bank said it was al­ready ob­serv­ing an in­creased ap­petite from banks for the above in­no­va­tive prod­uct that seeks to sup­port women en­trepreneurs. “We have re­cently signed agree­ments with lead­ing banks on the con­ti­nent who are keen to in­crease their women SMEs port­fo­lio. “AGF has al­ways been cog­nisant of the im­por­tance of sup­port­ing women SMEs to en­able them fully play their role as driv­ers of eco­nomic growth. “We are glad the mo­men­tum is in­creas­ing and that banks are now will­ing to take on this par­tic­u­lar busi­ness seg­ment,” AfDB quoted African Guar­an­tee Fund group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mr Jules Ngankam as say­ing. G4G, which re­ceives sup­port from the Group of Seven (G7) coun­tries as well as the Nether­lands and Swe­den, has three pil­lars: boost­ing ac­cess to fi­nance, pro­vid­ing tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and women busi­ness own­ers; and im­prov­ing the en­abling en­vi­ron­ment for women’s SMEs. AfDB di­rec­tor of fi­nan­cial ser­vice sec­tor de­vel­op­ment Mr Ste­fan Nal­letam­bly said the sign­ing of the AFAWA Guar­an­tee for Growth pro­gramme with AGF is a crit­i­cal mile­stone for the bank to suc­cess­fully de­ploy on-the-ground fi­nanc­ing in­stru­ments bet­ter suited to ad­dress­ing fi­nanc­ing and train­ing needs of women-owned SMEs in Africa for the growth and de­vel­op­ment of their busi­nesses. The G4G is also ex­pected to reach an av­er­age of 18 000 women SMEs and cre­ate 80 000 direct jobs. AfDB said African women face a US$42 bil­lion fi­nanc­ing gap, which AFAWA aims to bridge. This is tied to a lack of ac­cess to col­lat­eral in the form of land and prop­erty as well as to knowl­edge, men­tor­ship, and net­works to grow their busi­nesses, which are typ­i­cally in the in­for­mal sec­tor. “Donor and pri­vate sec­tor-sup­port for the over­all AFAWA ini­tia­tive is help­ing the bank set am­bi­tious tar­gets for AFAWA Guar­an­tee for Growth pro­gram,” said AfDB bank’s di­rec­tor for gen­der, women and civil so­ci­ety Ms Vanessa Moun­gar. “The en­tire bank ecosys­tem will be at play - invit­ing more fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to sign into the pro­gram - en­sur­ing engagement, im­ple­men­ta­tion, and own­er­ship at the mar­ket and pol­icy lev­els,” she said. AGF is a non-bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion whose ob­jec­tive is to pro­mote eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, in­crease em­ploy­ment and re­duce poverty in Africa by pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions with guar­an­tee prod­ucts and ca­pac­ity de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance specif­i­cally in­tended to sup­port SMEs in Africa. The fund was founded by the gov­ern­ment of Den­mark through the Dan­ish In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Agency (DANIDA), the gov­ern­ment of Spain through the Span­ish Agency for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (AECID) and the African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB). Other share­hold­ers in­clude: French De­vel­op­ment Agency (AFD), Nordic De­vel­op­ment Fund (NDF), In­vest­ment Fund for De­vel­op­ing Coun­tries (IFU) and KfW De­vel­op­ment Bank (KfW).",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190905,Why the West is get­ting jit­tery over Asian Tigers,"Peo­ple in the emerg­ing mar­kets are in­creas­ingly in­clined towards point­ing to coun­tries like China and Ja­pan for things they equally ad­mire and want to have in their own coun­tries. The Asian eco­nomic pow­er­houses now of­fer roads, rail­ways, mod­ern tech­nol­ogy and the de­vel­op­ment of mod­ern in­fra­struc­ture that has be­come even the envy of some Western coun­tries. Ama­jor event hap­pened in Ja­pan last week which brought a num­ber of African lead­ers to the Asian coun­try to dis­cuss how to fur­ther co­op­er­a­tion on eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa was part of the event named the Tokyo In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence for African De­vel­op­ment (TICAD 7) held in the city of Yoko­hama. The con­fer­ence cre­ated a plat­form for in­ter­ac­tion be­tween African lead­ers, the Ja­panese gov­ern­ment and prospec­tive Ja­panese in­vestors. It was busi­ness from day one, es­pe­cially for Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, who par­tic­i­pated in all the ses­sions and met with Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe and var­i­ous po­ten­tial in­vestors who ex­pressed their in­ter­est in Zim­babwe. If the con­fer­ence man­aged to prove that eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion be­tween African coun­tries and Ja­pan is nec­es­sary, it also demon­strated that there is now a vi­able al­ter­na­tive in push­ing for­ward the de­vel­op­ment of Africa. TICAD, to­gether with its Chi­nese equiv­a­lent called the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC), have man­aged to prove that de­vel­op­ment al­ter­na­tives for Africa are no longer com­ing from one side. In fact, China and Ja­pan are show­ing the world where the cen­tre of at­trac­tion for emerg­ing mar­kets is shift­ing towards. Not that African coun­tries are to­tally turn­ing a blind eye to the United States and other Western coun­tries when it comes to en­hanc­ing their eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tions. It is only that the African coun­tries and other emerg­ing economies are in­creas­ingly view­ing China and Ja­pan as of­fer­ing a vi­able op­tion. It is not sur­pris­ing then that the emerg­ing mar­kets through­out the world are as­so­ci­at­ing them­selves more with the Asian Tigers, whose de­vel­op­men­tal trajectory suits their sit­u­a­tion bet­ter. Many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are now re­al­is­ing that the em­pha­sis on pri­vate cap­i­tal­ism, lib­eral democ­racy and po­lit­i­cal rights can hardly put food on their ta­ble. Of course, this is the sys­tem that worked for the Western world, es­pe­cially from the era of the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion, but to the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, eco­nomic progress has re­mained a mi­rage. This is es­pe­cially more pro­nounced when the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries com­pare the Western sys­tem with that be­ing prof­fered by some of the Asian coun­tries, es­pe­cially China. Ev­ery­one in the emerg­ing economies now ad­mires how the Asian coun­tries man­aged to ex­ploit state cap­i­tal­ism and fo­cus on eco­nomic rights to take mil­lions of their cit­i­zens out of poverty within a short pe­riod. It is time that Western coun­tries and de­vel­op­men­tal en­thu­si­asts con­sider that there are now new mod­els of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment in other parts of the world that ap­peal more to emerg­ing mar­kets com­pared to the tra­di­tional ones from the West. The Western sys­tem worked for coun­tries in that re­gion, but it has failed to up­lift poor coun­tries out of poverty. Lib­eral eco­nomic pre­scrip­tions from the West like the eco­nomic struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grammes have left many coun­tries in deep poverty and seek­ing new ways of redeem­ing them­selves. The em­pha­sis on pol­i­tics as a pre­req­ui­site for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment be­ing prop­a­gated by the West has also failed to work in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. For in­stance, coun­tries that are deemed not to prac­tise the Western kind of democ­racy are de­nied an op­por­tu­nity to par­tic­i­pate in eco­nomic pro­grammes that come with po­lit­i­cal strings. With the emer­gence of coun­tries like China and Ja­pan, peo­ple in the emerg­ing economies are slowly re­al­is­ing that there are now new sys­tems that fit their eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tions. This sys­tem comes as purely busi­ness, with no po­lit­i­cal strings at­tached. Western democ­racy is a good and wellthought out con­cept, but it be­comes a ma­jor lim­i­ta­tion when it is used as a pre­req­ui­site for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Yet, the view of many in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries is that a good econ­omy will re­sult in the en­trench­ment of democ­racy, as it pro­duces goods and ser­vices that sat­isfy cit­i­zens. There are many peo­ple in emerg­ing eco­nom­ics who find the talk about democ­racy nause­at­ing sim­ply be­cause they are pre­oc­cu­pied with think­ing about where their next meal is com­ing from. To such peo­ple, the con­cept of democ­racy be­comes just an il­lu­sion. With­out strong economies, po­lit­i­cal pro­cesses like the hold­ing of elec­tions face the re­al­ity of los­ing mean­ing to peo­ple in emerg­ing economies. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is well aware of this fact, and this is ev­i­denced by his pro­nounce­ment that it is now time to fo­cus on the econ­omy, in­stead of con­tin­u­ing be­ing trapped in pol­i­tics. His em­pha­sis on less pol­i­tics and more on the econ­omy is in­flu­enced by the re­al­i­sa­tion that po­lit­i­cal sys­tems can func­tion more ef­fec­tively in an en­vi­ron­ment of eco­nomic progress. It seems the op­po­si­tion MDC-Al­liance has failed to grasp this sim­ple fact since the July 2018 har­monised elec­tions which it lost. For in­stance, a lot of peo­ple in Harare came out openly con­demn­ing the MDC-Al­liance’s call for demon­stra­tions which the party in­tended to hold on Au­gust 16. The clear mes­sage from such peo­ple was that demon­stra­tions are no longer an im­por­tant as­pect, with a con­cern that they dis­rupt their eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties. To these peo­ple, demon­stra­tions are part of a type of pol­i­tics that has failed to de­liver food on their ta­ble. The econ­omy is much more im­por­tant to them be­cause it brings such ne­ces­si­ties as food, ac­com­mo­da­tion, health­care and ed­u­ca­tion on their ta­ble, a feat which pol­i­tics will not achieve. Demon­stra­tions and choos­ing lead­ers in a demo­cratic way, like what hap­pened in the elec­tions last year, is well and good, but a good econ­omy of­fers much more than just po­lit­i­cal free­dom. In this case, the think­ing among those in emerg­ing mar­kets tends to drift towards a de­vel­op­ment model that un­der­scores the econ­omy which puts food on their ta­ble. And that is the al­ter­na­tive be­ing of­fered by the Asian eco­nomic giants. In the past, peo­ple in the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries used to ad­mire what the Western coun­tries were of­fer­ing. But now there is an al­ter­na­tive. Peo­ple in the emerg­ing mar­kets are in­creas­ingly in­clined towards point­ing to coun­tries like China and Ja­pan for things they equally ad­mire and want to have in their own coun­tries. The Asian eco­nomic pow­er­houses now of­fer roads, rail­ways, mod­ern tech­nol­ogy and the de­vel­op­ment of mod­ern in­fra­struc­ture that has be­come even the envy of some Western coun­tries. They also of­fer loans and grants, in most cases with­out at­tach­ing po­lit­i­cal strings, as op­posed to the Western model, which con­sid­ers in­ter­fer­ence in other coun­tries’ in­ter­nal af­fairs as a pre­con­di­tion for such aid. The Asian coun­tries’ em­pha­sis is on win­win co­op­er­a­tion aimed at eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment based on purely busi­ness terms. This is the sys­tem — which does not put em­pha­sis on pol­i­tics, but on the econ­omy — which many peo­ple in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries point to as be­ing the most ideal to bring about quick results. These peo­ple watch the progress which is be­ing made un­der the sys­tem be­ing fol­lowed by Asian coun­tries with envy and in­spi­ra­tion, and con­sider it the clos­est to as­sist­ing them in mak­ing it. ◆ Read the full ar­ti­cle on www.herald. co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200910,China shares ex­pe­ri­ence on de­vo­lu­tion agenda,"Pre­sen­ta­tion by China’s Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe, His Ex­cel­lency Guo Shaochun dur­ing a Zim­pa­pers edi­tors’ work­shop IT’S an hon­our to join you for this work­shop. I’m sure the dis­cus­sion to­day will be very re­ward­ing. Zim­babwe al­ready has a re­mark­able de­gree of ad­min­is­tra­tive de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion. There is strong po­lit­i­cal will from the very top, from the State leader; there is a le­gal and in­sti­tu­tional frame­work gov­ern­ing de­vo­lu­tion; our work­shop to­day also shows there is strong pub­lic in­ter­est in de­vo­lu­tion. I would like to com­mend the achieve­ments made so far by the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment in de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion for the well-be­ing of its pop­u­la­tion across the coun­try. We also ac­knowl­edge that like other coun­tries, Zim­babwe still faces some chal­lenges in de­vo­lu­tion, such as clar­ity on the roles and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the three tiers of Gov­ern­ment, ad­e­quate re­sourc­ing of the sub-na­tional au­thor­i­ties, and ef­fi­ciency in pol­icy ex­e­cu­tion. China has gone a long way in try­ing to ad­dress some sim­i­lar chal­lenges. I hope my re­marks to­day will of­fer you some food for thought. I am go­ing to fo­cus on three ques­tions. How did China del­e­gate pow­ers to the lower lev­els of govern­ments? How did China man­age the is­sue of fund­ing? And how did China make sure de­vo­lu­tion de­liv­ers its de­sired re­sult? First, the pow­ers. Like the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment, China took a grad­u­al­ist ap­proach in de­vo­lu­tion, start­ing from the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones in Shen­zhen, Zhuhai, Shan­tou and Xi­a­men, and ex­panded step by step to more coastal cities, new de­vel­op­ment ar­eas, and then across the coun­try. The Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones were given the pow­ers to for­mu­late their own de­vel­op­ment plans, give ac­cess to for­eign in­vest­ments, con­duct in­dus­try and com­merce reg­is­tra­tion and land al­lot­ment, and de­cide on fixed as­set in­vest­ment, for­eign trade and for­eign ex­change, pric­ing, and re­sources al­lo­ca­tion. To draw a clear bound­ary on the roles of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of dif­fer­ent lev­els of govern­ments, the gov­ern­ment cre­ated four lists — the list of pow­ers, of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, a neg­a­tive list, and a list of ser­vice pro­vi­sion. This in­for­ma­tion is avail­able to all in ta­bles and forms to re­ceive pub­lic scru­tiny. In re­cent years, with the de­vel­op­ment of tech­nol­ogy, big data and cloud com­put­ing are also used to mon­i­tor gov­ern­ment ac­tiv­i­ties. The de­vo­lu­tion process is not a one-way traf­fic, but an in­ter­ac­tion be­tween the cen­tral and other lev­els of govern­ments. Pro­vin­cial and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties may ne­go­ti­ate what pow­ers are del­e­gated, in light of their lo­cal con­di­tions. Mean­while, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment is care­ful about re­tain­ing some im­por­tant pow­ers. For ex­am­ple, when Guang­dong Prov­ince be­came home to spe­cial eco­nomic zones, it gained the power to ap­prove for­eign in­vest­ment projects. But if a pro­posed light in­dus­try project ex­ceeds 30 mil­lion RMB, or a heavy in­dus­try project goes above 50 mil­lion, Guang­dong Prov­ince would still need per­mis­sion from the cen­tral gov­ern­ment. This makes the cen­tral gov­ern­ment the gate­keeper for ma­jor eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties to avoid over­heat­ing and re­dun­dant ca­pac­ity and en­sure eq­ui­table growth across re­gions. Sec­ond is fund­ing. Un­der­stand­ing the crit­i­cal im­por­tance for fund­ing to fol­low func­tions, China del­e­gated sig­nif­i­cant fis­cal pow­ers to the sub-na­tional lev­els in the early stage of its re­form. Be­fore the early 1990s, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment did not have its own tax col­lec­tion agen­cies. Taxes were col­lected by lo­cal govern­ments and then partly trans­ferred to the cen­tral gov­ern­ment by a set ra­tio. Over time, this ar­range­ment be­gan to pro­duce prob­lems. The cen­tral gov­ern­ment did not have enough fis­cal re­sources for macro con­trol. In 1994, China es­tab­lished a tax-as­sign­ment sys­tem. Taxes were di­vided into three dis­tinct cat­e­gories: cen­tral, lo­cal, and shared. Cen­tral taxes would go into the cen­tral cof­fer, and lo­cal taxes into lo­cal bud­gets. As for the shared taxes, they were di­vided be­tween the cen­tral and pro­vin­cial govern­ments, ac­cord­ing to some es­tab­lished for­mu­las. For in­stance, 75 per­cent of VAT rev­enue be­longed to the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and the re­main­ing 25 per­cent to the pro­vin­cial ones. Since then, the rev­enue-shar­ing ar­range­ment has been un­der­go­ing con­stant im­prove­ments. To­day the cen­tral and pro­vin­cial govern­ments share in­come tax by a ra­tio of 60:40 and VAT by 50:50. En­vi­ron­men­tal tax be­longs com­pletely to lo­cal govern­ments to en­cour­age on-the-ground ac­tions. A more so­phis­ti­cate fis­cal trans­fer sys­tem has also been put in place. Last year, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment trans­ferred 67.9 per­cent of its dis­pos­able rev­enue to lo­cal govern­ments, and 36.5 per­cent of lo­cal gov­ern­ment spend­ing was funded by the cen­tral fis­cal trans­fer. In to­tal gov­ern­ment rev­enue, the cen­tral gov­ern­ment ac­counted for 46.9 per­cent. Third ques­tion, how does cen­tral gov­ern­ment make sure the lo­cal govern­ments de­liver on value? The Com­mu­nist Party of China and the cen­tral gov­ern­ment have well-es­tab­lished sys­tems for eval­u­at­ing the per­for­mance of of­fi­cials at dif­fer­ent lev­els. In ad­di­tion to in­tegrity, lead­er­ship skills, and dili­gence, it also looks at in­di­ca­tors for eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. These in­di­ca­tors are con­stantly up­dated to align with the over­all na­tional de­vel­op­ment strat­egy. In the early days of re­form, GDP growth, fis­cal rev­enue, and for­eign in­vest­ment were among the most im­por­tant. To­day, with China fo­cused on pro­mot­ing qual­ity growth, of­fi­cials are also eval­u­ated in terms of how they fight poverty and pol­lu­tion, how ef­fec­tive they are in mit­i­gat­ing fi­nan­cial risks, how they im­prove so­cial ser­vices, sup­port in­no­va­tion and the rule of law, and how they pro­mote peace and so­cial jus­tice, to name a few. This sys­tem en­sures that the pow­ers del­e­gated to lower lev­els are truly used to im­ple­ment the pol­icy di­rec­tion given by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment. It also en­cour­ages com­pe­ti­tion at the lo­cal level. In short, de­vo­lu­tion in China is not a sim­ple dis­tri­bu­tion of power and in­ter­ests, but a more sci­en­tific and bal­anced al­lo­ca­tion of power and re­spon­si­bil­ity, so that na­tional strate­gic de­ci­sions can be more ef­fec­tively im­ple­mented at all lev­els of gov­ern­ment. In the mean­time, suc­cess­ful lo­cal prac­tice can help im­prove de­ci­sion-mak­ing at the na­tional level, or even di­rectly de­velop into na­tional poli­cies. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190527,China keen to sup­port lo­cal agric sec­tor,"CHINA has re­it­er­ated its com­mit­ment to work with Zim­babwe for mu­tual de­vel­op­ment in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor to achieve food se­cu­rity by 2030. Speak­ing dur­ing the han­dover cer­e­mony of a dona­tion of 10 165 tonnes of premium rice to the Grain Mar­ket­ing Board (GMB) in Harare last Fri­day, China’s Vice Min­is­ter of Com­merce, Dr Qian Kem­ing, said: “Giv­ing food to Zim­babwe is not enough. Help­ing Zim­babwe to pro­duce more food and more jobs is key to agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment. As an­nounced by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, we will sup­port Africa in achiev­ing gen­eral food se­cu­rity by 2030 and work with Africa to for­mu­late and im­ple­ment a pro­gramme to pro­mote China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion on agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion. “To­wards that goal, we will con­tinue to pro­vide emer­gency hu­man­i­tar­ian food as­sis­tance to Zim­babwe, en­cour­age Chi­nese com­pa­nies to in­crease in­vest­ment in its agri­cul­tural in­dus­try, fa­cil­i­tate more im­ports of Zim­bab­wean agri­cul­tural prod­ucts, and ca­pac­i­tate lo­cal ex­perts and en­trepreneurs through pro­fes­sional train­ing.” Dr Qian said China was de­ter­mined to make lives of Zim­bab­weans bet­ter as part of grow­ing Sino-Zim­babwe re­la­tions. He added that China will work with Zim­babwe to un­lock po­ten­tial ar­eas of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion to al­le­vi­ate poverty, in­crease em­ploy­ment, in­come and im­prove liveli­hoods of Zim­bab­weans. “China is com­mit­ted to as­sist­ing Zim­babwe’s agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment. We have do­nated rice and fer­tiliser, provided agri­cul­tural equip­ment to re­lieve famine and boost pro­duc­tion, despatched a to­tal of 45 se­nior agri­cul­tural ex­perts to share experiences with lo­cal ex­perts and farm­ers, and aided an agri­cul­tural demon­stra­tion cen­tre to trans­fer tech­nol­ogy and know-how to Zim­bab­wean young farm­ers. “This dona­tion of 10 165 tonnes of rice is a re­sponse to the call of the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple for fight against wide­spread famine and cy­clone af­ter­math relief,” said Dr Kem­ing. Pub­lic Ser­vice, Labour and So­cial Wel­fare Min­is­ter Dr Sekai Nzenza, who re­ceived the dona­tion, thanked China for its grat­i­tude. “On be­half of Gov­ern­ment let me thank you for this gen­er­ous sup­port. It is my hope that your doors will re­main open for us as we will keep on knock­ing since the ef­fects of Cy­clone Idai are still to come. “Gov­ern­ment will fo­cus on re­silience build­ing pro­grammes in our vul­ner­a­ble dis­tricts. It is our hope that this cor­dial re­la­tion­ship with the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China will con­tinue to grow stronger and stronger,” said Dr Nzenza.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200724,Ex-farmer forms po­lit­i­cal party,"FOR­MER com­mer­cial farmer Dar­ryl Col­let has been un­veiled as in­terim pres­i­dent of a new op­po­si­tion party, The Pa­tri­otic Front (TPF) that preaches em­pow­er­ment of the masses. Col­let was un­veiled as in­terim pres­i­dent of the party at the Bu­l­awayo Me­dia Cen­tre on Wed­nes­day. The new op­po­si­tion party joins many oth­ers that have been formed in re­cent years, par­tic­u­larly to­wards the elec­tions only to dis­ap­pear af­ter the polls. Col­let said deep-seated poverty faced by long-suf­fer­ing Zim­bab­weans forced mem­bers of the TPF to come to­gether to of­fer so­lu­tions to the coun­try’s chal­lenges. “These are is­sues that need to be ad­dressed and it is for this rea­son that The Pa­tri­otic Front has been founded in or­der to bring to­gether the great minds of the coun­try in an all-out ef­fort to bring in the change that is needed,” Col­let said. “Not to recog­nise and cor­rect the er­ro­neous de­ci­sions that we have made in or­der to achieve the change that the free­dom was to bring and that was fought for, will con­tinue the slip­pery slide into non-ex­is­tent so­cial ser­vices and in­ad­e­quate health ser­vices, ad­mit­ted to by our lead­ers ev­ery time one of them is ill and rushed off to China for the med­i­cal at­ten­tion they need, which should be of­fered here to all, if our doc­tors and nurses were given ev­ery­thing they need to care for the health of all.” Col­let, who said he was forced off his farm dur­ing the fast-track land re­form pro­gramme, said Zim­bab­weans had the right to demon­strate against the gov­ern­ment on July 31 as the cri­sis they faced was un­bear­able. “Most painful in all this is that the cry of the peo­ple is ap­par­ently not heard which re­sults in anti-gov­ern­ment forces eas­ily amass­ing the crowds for in­tended marches and demon­stra­tions such as those planned for July 31,” he said, adding that the TPF be­lieved in em­pow­er­ment of the masses re­gard­less of race or tribe. “We be­lieve that Zim­bab­wean cit­i­zens must own and de­ter­mine the dis­tri­bu­tion of these re­sources and op­por­tu­ni­ties.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190402,Main­stream dis­as­ter man­age­ment in Sadc,"ROPICAL Cy­clone Idai is re­garded as one of the worst trop­i­cal cy­clones on record to af­fect Africa and the South­ern Hemi­sphere as a whole. The lived storm caused cat­a­strophic dam­age in Mozam­bique, Zim­babwe and Malawi, leaving hun­dreds of peo­ple dead and or miss­ing, while thou­sands more have been dis­placed. A ma­jor hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis un­folded in the wake of the cy­clone, with hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple in ur­gent need of as­sis­tance across the three coun­tries As the three coun­tries in the South­ern Africa re­gion, namely Zim­babwe, Malawi and Mozam­bique slowly re­cover from the dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects of Cy­clone Idai that rav­aged them re­cently, it’s time for the re­gional body the South­ern Africa De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC), to step up ef­forts to in­clude dis­as­ter man­age­ment and early warn­ing signs as part of the re­gional in­te­gra­tion. The ef­fects of the cy­clone have again high­lighted the need to con­tin­u­ously main­stream dis­as­ter pre­pared­ness and re­sponse into the re­gional in­te­gra­tion ef­forts. Re­gional in­te­gra­tion is de­scribed as the process of over­com­ing bar­ri­ers that di­vide neigh­bour­ing coun­tries by com­mon ac­cord, in this case the SADC Treaty, and of jointly man­ag­ing shared re­sources and as­sets. Es­sen­tially, it is a process by which groups of coun­tries lib­er­alise trade, cre­at­ing a com­mon mar­ket for goods, peo­ple, cap­i­tal and ser­vices. This has given the per­cep­tion that re­gional in­te­gra­tion is only fo­cused on the eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and trade as­pects only. This process is over­seen by the gov­ern­ments of the spe­cific states. Past ef­forts at re­gional in­te­gra­tion have of­ten been seen to be fo­cused on re­mov­ing bar­ri­ers to free trade in the re­gion, in­creas­ing the free move­ment of peo­ple, labour, goods, and cap­i­tal across na­tional borders, re­duc­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of re­gional armed con­flict, and adopt­ing co­he­sive re­gional stances on pol­icy is­sues, such as the en­vi­ron­ment, cli­mate change and mi­gra­tion. It was only in 2016 that SADC mem­ber states agreed to come to­gether and to act in uni­son on is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est and in com­ing up with a com­pre­hen­sive and in­te­grated re­gional ap­proach to Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion and Re­sponse Strat­egy. The SADC Re­gional Dis­as­ter Pre­pared­ness and Re­sponse Strat­egy was ex­pected to en­hance co­or­di­nated in­ter­ven­tions to dis­as­ters in the re­gion and act as a dis­as­ter re­duc­tion strat­egy. The strat­egy was also ex­pected to see the establishment of the Dis­as­ter Fund. The im­por­tance of DRR to SADC ci­ti­zens, coun­tries and the re­gion at large can­not be overem­pha­sised, es­pe­cially as the re­gion re­cov­ers from Cy­clone Idai de­spite the fact that the re­gion has also been se­verely hit by the El Nino-in­duced drought since 2014 and the past sea­son was no dif­fer­ent. Dis­as­ter risk man­age­ment in­cludes pre­pared­ness, mit­i­ga­tion, re­sponse, re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and re­cov­ery. As the ef­fects of cli­mate change and global warm­ing are now be­ing felt in most coun­tries, the SADC re­gion con­tin­ues to face an in­creas­ing trend in dis­as­ter oc­cur­rences, ex­am­ples be­ing the most re­cent Cy­clone Idai, which caught most mem­ber states un­pre­pared. The Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion Unit of the SADC Sec­re­tariat, which is man­dated to pro-ac­tively co­or­di­nate dis­as­ter risk man­age­ment at re­gional level, was also caught flat-footed by Idai and the El Nino-in­duced drought and acute wa­ter short­ages which can be at­trib­uted to pro­longed drought con­di­tions. The in­fras­truc­tural dam­ages of Cy­clone Idai runs into mil­lions, leaving many ci­ti­zens of the three coun­tries to wal­low in poverty, em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of im­ple­ment­ing dis­as­ter risk re­duc­tion strate­gies and frame­works to­wards erad­i­ca­tion of ex­treme poverty. Dis­as­ter oc­cur­rences are neg­a­tively af­fect­ing de­vel­op­ment as re­sources are chan­nelled to re­build­ing and it is ev­i­dent from Cy­clone Idai that it is mostly the poor com­mu­ni­ties and the vul­ner­a­ble that are the worst af­fected when dis­as­ters oc­cur be­cause of their lack of ca­pac­ity to cope with the im­pact, hence the ur­gent need of the op­er­a­tiona­lias­tion of the Dis­as­ter Fund. Cli­mate change, which has brought sever­ity of ex­treme weather con­di­tions and has over­whelmed the dis­as­ter pre­pared­ness ca­pac­ity in all af­fected mem­ber coun­tries, mean­ing that SADC has to in­vest in ac­tions that would ac­cel­er­ate the achieve­ment of sus­tain­able re­silience to dis­as­ters. Cy­clone Idai that rav­aged the re­gion has ex­posed the re­gion’s dis­as­ter risk man­age­ment chal­lenges that in­clude un­der­fund­ing and un­co­or­di­nated ef­forts. This shows the lack of in­sti­tu­tional frame­works for dis­as­ter risk re­duc­tion at the re­gional level de­spite the pres­ence of the Dis­as­ter Risk Re­duc­tion Unit within the SADC Sec­re­tariat. The cy­clone has also high­lighted the weak in­for­ma­tion and knowl­edge man­age­ment sys­tems, specif­i­cally in high risk ar­eas and lack of com­pre­hen­sive and con­stantly up­dated risk as­sess­ments and anal­y­sis. This calls for the ur­gent need to ca­pac­i­tate through the pro­vi­sion of fund­ing to the unit as it plays a crit­i­cal role in the re­gion’s dis­as­ter man­age­ment. SADC, as a body has not de­vel­oped a protocol on dis­as­ter risk re­duc­tion or man­age­ment and only re­lies on the strat­egy and other com­pli­men­tary pro­to­cols such as the de­fence, pol­i­tics and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion protocol Ar­ti­cle 2, which states that a spe­cific ob­jec­tive of the Or­gan on Pol­i­tics, De­fence and Se­cu­rity Co­op­er­a­tion shall be to “en­hance re­gional ca­pac­ity in re­spect of dis­as­ter man­age­ment and co­or­di­na­tion of in­ter­na­tional hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance” and one hopes that af­ter Idai there will be a stand­alone protocol on dis­as­ter man­age­ment. An­other com­pli­men­tary SADC protocol that is used in dis­as­ter man­age­ment is the 1999 Health protocol Ar­ti­cle 25 on Emer­gency Health Ser­vices and Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment. This ar­ti­cles calls on states to co-op­er­ate and as­sist each other in the co-or­di­na­tion and man­age­ment of dis­as­ter and emer­gency sit­u­a­tions; de­velop mech­a­nisms for co-op­er­a­tion and as­sis­tance with emer­gency ser­vices and to col­lab­o­rate and fa­cil­i­tate re­gional ef­forts in de­vel­op­ing aware­ness, risk re­duc­tion, pre­pared­ness and man­age­ment plans for nat­u­ral and man-made dis­as­ters. In the past, the most sig­nif­i­cant con­sid­er­a­tion in join­ing a re­gional eco­nomic group such as SADC, how­ever, as men­tioned ear­lier, was the eco­nomic ben­e­fit each in­di­vid­ual na­tion stood to gain, but as has been dis­cussed ear­lier, the ben­e­fits far ex­ceed the eco­nomic and com­bined re­gional ef­forts in dis­as­ter risk man­age­ment to en­sure com­mu­nity safety and pro­tec­tion of eco­nomic as­sets as seen by the com­ing to­gether of SADC mem­ber states in try­ing to min­imise the ef­fects of Cy­clone Idai is an­other. It is, there­fore, im­per­a­tive that dis­as­ter risk man­age­ment be main­streamed in the re­gional in­te­gra­tion of the SADC bloc. trength­en­ing Africa’s peace and se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture should un­der­pin the next phase of its bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion with China. The Di­a­logue on the Im­ple­men­ta­tion of China-Africa Peace and Se­cu­rity Ini­tia­tive was held in Ad­dis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Fe­bru­ary 6. The di­a­logue was a pi­o­neer­ing step in strength­en­ing the peace and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion of China and Africa as well as a con­crete move to de­liver the out­comes of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion 2018 Bei­jing Sum­mit. At the sum­mit, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping out­lined new mea­sures to strengthen China-Africa peace and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion, and reached im­por­tant con­sen­sus with African lead­ers on launch­ing the peace and se­cu­rity ini­tia­tive. China-Africa re­la­tions have for many years been de­fined by de­vel­op­ment, but now a con­ver­sa­tion to en­gage in matters of peace and se­cu­rity has gained mo­men­tum. This idea of seek­ing win-win so­lu­tions means that China has a stake in en­sur­ing that its part­ner­ship leads to mu­tual gains. This part­ner­ship will sur­vive so long as both China and Africa feel that they are mak­ing progress to­wards their goals in a win-win sit­u­a­tion. African coun­tries have shown in­ter­est in the Chi­nese model of a com­mu­nity of shared des­tiny, which ad­dresses the root causes of in­sta­bil­ity, in­clud­ing poverty and in­equal­ity. For in­stance, the Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment model that has fo­cused on wealth cre­ation to deal with un­em­ploy­ment is at the core of Africa’s bid to pro­mote peace and se­cu­rity. In an ad­dress to the United Na­tions Gen­eral As­sem­bly in 2015, Pres­i­dent Xi of­fered $100 mil­lion in mil­i­tary as­sis­tance for a pe­riod of five years to sup­port the African Union peace and se­cu­rity ar­chi­tec­ture through the African Standby Force and African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Crises.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180618,Goals set for FO­CAC sum­mit,"BEIJING. — The Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FO­CAC) Sum­mit, to be held in Beijing in Septem­ber, will fo­cus on five goals, a se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cial said. Dai Bing, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry’s Depart­ment of African Af­fairs, said the sum­mit will seek to take the time-hon­oured friend­ship between China and Africa to a higher level. It will strengthen the strate­gic con­sen­sus between the two sides to main­tain their friend­ship, con­sol­i­date the po­lit­i­cal foun­da­tion for their unity and co­op­er­a­tion, and in­ject a strong im­pe­tus into the devel­op­ment of the bi­lat­eral ties in the new era. The event will also chart the course for de­vel­op­ing fu­ture re­la­tions. To build a stronger com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture between China and African coun­tries and achieve win-win co­op­er­a­tion and com­mon devel­op­ment, it will aim to syn­er­gise the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, the United Na­tions’ 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment, the African Union’s Agenda 2063, and the devel­op­ment strate­gies of in­di­vid­ual African coun­tries. It will seek to en­hance na­tional and global sup­port and un­der­stand­ing of China-Africa friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion, and to en­cour­age the in­ter­na­tional so­ci­ety to see the devel­op­ment of China-Africa re­la­tions from a more ob­jec­tive and just per­spec­tive. The sum­mit’s goals also in­clude pro­mot­ing eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion, tak­ing longer-term ben­e­fits into ac­count as well. More tar­geted and ef­fec­tive mea­sures are ex­pected to align Africa’s nat­u­ral re­sources, pop­u­la­tion div­i­dends and mar­ket po­ten­tial with China’s in­vest­ment, equip­ment and tech­nol­ogy, so that their co­op­er­a­tion will be mar­ket-ori­ented in­stead of gov­ern­ment-led, ex­pand to pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity from com­mod­ity trad­ing, and with more in­vest­ments than con­tracted projects. The lead­ers are also ex­pected to dis­cuss a co­or­di­nated and bal­anced devel­op­ment of China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion.

The money was availed through the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP). This emerged when Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Huang Ping and WFP Rep­re­sen­ta­tive and Coun­try Di­rec­tor, Mr Ed­die Rowe paid a cour­tesy call to Mid­lands Min­is­ter of State for Pro­vin­cial Af­fairs, Cde Ja­son Machaya. Mr Rowe said the United Na­tions agency had iden­ti­fied key pro­duc­tion as­sets such as wa­ter bod­ies for fund­ing. He said some of the projects that would en­able sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion in­clude wa­ter har­vest­ing. “China through our mul­ti­lat­eral plat­forms has availed $ 5 mil­lion to WFP Zim­babwe. “This money will go to­wards liveli­hood en­hance­ment, re­silient build­ing and ca­pac­ity en­hance­ment. We re­ceived $1 mil­lion for flood vic­tims but we only used 40 per­cent of that money to buy food for the vic­tims and the re­main­der we used it for other pro­grammes that en­sure sus­tain­able food pro­duc­tion and liveli­hood en­hance­ment,” he said. The Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe said China was also drilling 300 bore­holes in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try to en­sure ac­cess to safe drink­ing wa­ter. He said China was also go­ing to do­nate 12 000 tonnes of rice to Zim­babwe even though the coun­try re­alised a bumper harvest. “Zim­babwe and China en­joy cor­dial re­la­tions dat­ing back to the time of the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle. We are sink­ing 300 bore­holes in Zim­babwe that should be com­pleted by the end of this year and we are do­nat­ing 12 000 tonnes of maize,” he said.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20151122,Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones: Prospects for Zim­babwe,"Hav­ing fol­lowed Euro­pean de­vel­op­ment mod­els for many decades, the post-colo­nial state in Africa is yet to enjoy the promised ben­e­fits of de­vel­op­ment and ef­fec­tively em­power its cit­i­zens HOW­EVER, China’s ar­rival on the global eco­nomic stage, with re­forms that have en­abled it to emerge as the largest econ­omy in the world and ex­tri­cate the larger part of its pop­u­la­tion from poverty in a record time of less than 30 years, has height­ened the call for a re­think of Africa’s de­vel­op­ment model. This has shown that it is pos­si­ble for Africa to in­dus­tri­alise through an al­ter­na­tive model unique to the con­ti­nent, a model that is not nec­es­sar­ily the same as that cham­pi­oned by Western pro­po­nents. China and Africa are very dif­fer­ent poli­ties. China is a uni­tary state with more than a bil­lion peo­ple, while Africa is a con­ti­nent of 55 frag­mented sov­er­eign states. Yet, de­spite th­ese dif­fer­ences, China and Africa share many com­mon­al­i­ties of a his­tor­i­cal, ge­o­graph­i­cal and de­mo­graphic na­ture, and more. Africa’s com­bined pop­u­la­tion of 1,1 bil­lion is al­most the same size as that of China at 1,35 bil­lion. China, In­dia and Africa are the three most pop­u­lous re­gions of the world. Th­ese re­gions share a sim­i­lar colo­nial history, hav­ing suf­fered from re­source ex­ploita­tion by im­pe­rial pow­ers. They suf­fered ex­treme poverty at the turn of the cen­tury, with China hav­ing turned its for­tunes around and In­dia mov­ing in that di­rec­tion, while the ma­jor­ity of states in Africa are still suf­fer­ing from ris­ing in­equal­i­ties. The suc­cess of China’s in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment can be at­trib­uted to grad­ual and strate­gic eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion, an ef­fec­tive pol­icy of FDI, in­cen­tives to both pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor en­ter­prises, strat­egy of in­ter­na­tion­al­i­sa­tion for state-owned en­ter­prises, re­search and de­vel­op­ment, and dy­namic state in­sti­tu­tions for pol­icy guidance. Suc­cess is driven by China’s strate­gic bal­ance of pro­tec­tion­ism and eco­nomic lib­er­al­ism; China’s in­vest­ment pol­icy and the re­gional de­vel­op­ment pol­icy; and ex­port-ori­ented growth and for­eign eco­nomic pol­icy. Two strong fea­tures of China’s rapid eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment are the in­vest­ment- driven and ex­port- ori­ented growth, based on the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to for­mu­late an ef­fec­tive In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Pol­icy while main­tain­ing a favourable cli­mate for for­eign in­vest­ment. In or­der to at­tract FDI with­out threat­en­ing the growth of do­mes­tic in­dus­tries, China adopted mea­sures that in­clude: ◆ Re­gional in­dus­trial poli­cies and ex­port pro­mo­tion strate­gies; ◆ De­vel­op­ment-ori­ented and sus­tain­able FDI regimes that pro­mote cap­i­tal in­flow, joint ven­tures be­tween lo­cal firms and for­eign in­vest­ment; and ◆ Adop­tion of co­her­ent strate­gies for spe­cial eco­nomic zones. Since the 1980s, spe­cial eco­nomic zones were in­tro­duced in China through care­ful ex­per­i­men­ta­tion, no­tably start­ing in Guang­dong Prov­ince where the re­mark­able story of Shen­zhen was turned from what was once a fish­ing vil­lage into an ul­tra-mod­ern in­dus­trial city. This model has since been repli­cated over the last 35 years in other parts of China, turn­ing the coun­try from a pre­vi­ously agro-based econ­omy into one that now de­rives about 90 per­cent of its in­come from in­dus­trial and ser­vice sec­tors. China is al­ready sup­port­ing SEZs in African coun­tries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Mau­ri­tius, Nige­ria and Zam­bia. There are some lessons that can be drawn and adapted from China’s de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence. A grow­ing in­dus­trial sec­tor is key to the sus­tained over­all eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of a coun­try due to the mul­ti­plier ef­fect in­so­far as it promotes value ad­di­tion and em­ploy­ment gen­er­a­tion. SEZs can be ap­plied at many lev­els from city, provin­cial to na­tional coun- try level. Per­haps the one level that should be con­sid­ered in China-Africa re­la­tions is ex­tend­ing this to the sub-re­gional level. The SEZs al­ready es­tab­lished in African coun­tries should, there­fore, in­cor­po­rate a re­gional out­look, with im­pact on re­gional de­vel­op­ment. The op­por­tu­nity is fur­ther pre­sented by the fact that for the fi rst time in 2012, China and Africa through the Fo­rum on China Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Focac) noted the im­por­tance of re­la­tions be­tween China and sub-re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions and agreed to co­op­er­ate to pro­mote eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. SEZs of­fer a good op­por­tu­nity to push African in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. The global man­u­fac­tur­ing cen­tre has his­tor­i­cally shifted from Eng­land in the last 200 years, to Ger­many in the last 100 years, to the United States since the 1940s, to Ja­pan since the 1960s and 1970s, and now more re­cently to China. All de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that have suc­cess­fully made the tran­si­tion from low-in­come to mid­dle and high-in­come sta­tus such as China and the East Asian Tigers as well as Latin Amer­i­can coun­tries have done so re­ly­ing on a strong man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor as the driver of an ex­port-ori­ented growth econ­omy. This has been achieved with a strong role for gov­ern­ment, es­pe­cially in the pro­vi­sion of in­fra­struc­ture whose mag­netic power has been most ev­i­dent in China in at­tract­ing new in­dus­tries and other forms of de­vel­op­ment. Most African coun­tries are still to break from the cur­rent consumption and com­mod­ity ex­ports de­vel­op­ment path to a more sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment model based on in­dus­trial com­pet­i­tive­ness. China’s SEZ ex­pe­ri­ence, there­fore, of­fers a vi­able op­tion if care­fully de­signed with African char­ac­ter­is­tic. ◆ This ar­ti­cle by the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of re­spected re­gional think tank, the Southern African Re­search and Doc­u­men­ta­tion Cen­tre (Sardc), through its In­sti­tute for China-Africa Stud­ies in Southern Africa, is part of a se­ries ex­plor­ing the di­men­sions of China-Africa re­la­tions ahead of the Focac Sum­mit in Johannesburg in De­cem­ber 2015.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20191020,Lessons from China,"of a just in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic or­der are part of the ex­ter­nal fac­tors caus­ing un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Al­though de­vel­op­ment is a re­sult of both ex­ter­nal and in­ter­nal fac­tors, in­ter­nal fac­tors should al­ways play a more im­por­tant role and these are closely linked to cul­ture. It is cul­ture that in­flu­ences in­sti­tu­tional de­sign that breeds an ef­fec­tive in­dus­trial pol­icy. For­mer Am­bas­sador to China Christo­pher Mutsvangwa says if DNA is the foun­da­tion of the in­sti­tu­tional mem­ory of liv­ing or­gan­isms, then cul­ture is its equiv­a­lent in the in­sti­tu­tional mem­ory of so­ci­ety. Cul­ture, he says, is the arts and other man­i­fes­ta­tions of hu­man in­tel­lec­tual achieve­ment re­garded col­lec­tively. It is shown through ideas, cus­toms and so­cial be­hav­iour of so­ci­ety. It is the em­bod­i­ment of shared val­ues that de­fine the iden­tity of a so­cial group­ing. “China with the largest pop­u­la­tion on earth has de­vel­oped its cul­ture over 5 000 years. Its ca­pac­ity to de­fend it­self en­sured that by and large its so­ci­ety could re­pulse, with­stand or ab­sorb re­peated ruc­tions from other out­side so­ci­eties. It is this as­pect that has given Chi­nese cul­ture pride of place among its so­ci­ety and ad­mi­ra­tion from other so­ci­eties,” said Am­bas­sador Mutsvangwa. Cul­ture ex­tends across all di­men­sions of so­cial cap­i­tal such as mu­tual con­fi­dence, trust and re­spon­si­ble civic be­hav­iour. Unesco em­pha­sises that cul­ture is a key el­e­ment in the fight against poverty. Pre­serv­ing cul­tural val­ues is very im­por­tant for de­vel­op­ment and Zim­babwe should de­velop and value trust in its in­sti­tu­tions so as to val­i­date the so­cial con­tract be­tween Gov­ern­ment and the gov­erned. Trust is a mea­sure of how peo­ple eval­u­ate the moral fab­ric in their so­ci­ety and a lack of it breeds other ills such as dis­hon­esty and cor­rup­tion. Cor­rup­tion raises sev­eral is­sues re­gard­ing the re­la­tion­ship be­tween cit­i­zens and their gov­ern­ments. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping warns that fi­nan­cial scan­dals, or abuse of pub­lic re­sources to achieve per­sonal ben­e­fits, un­der­mines bases of au­thor­ity and le­git­i­macy. Cor­rup­tion con­sti­tutes a vi­o­la­tion of the un­writ­ten con­tract be­tween cit­i­zens and pub­lic of­fi­cials. A cul­ture of cor­rup­tion in so­ci­ety dis­torts pub­lic de­mands, in­creases the cost, re­duces qual­ity, and de­lay the com­pe­ti­tion of pub­lic works. Third world coun­tries can there­fore pluck a leaf from China on how they can broaden their cul­ture in­dus­tries and link their de­vel­op­ment to unique char­ac­ter­is­tics of their peo­ple’s cul­tures and not from en­tirely pre­scrip­tive modes of de­vel­op­ment not in sync with their value sys­tems an d be­liefs.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171128,Women must steer in­dus­trial growth: UN,"VI­ENNA. — Women need to be given a greater role in in­dus­tries in poorer na­tions to meet the global goal of cut­ting poverty by 2030, the head of the United Na­tions in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment agency said yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing voted in for a sec­ond term. Li Yong said em­pow­er­ing women will be a pri­or­ity in his sec­ond four-year term as di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the United Na­tions In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Organisation (UNIDO). Data shows only about half of the world’s women are in the labour force com­pared to about 75 per­cent of men, in less se­nior roles, and earn on av­er­age 60 to 75 per­cent of what men make. But stud­ies re­peat­edly show that more women work­ing ac­cel­er­ates eco­nomic growth, while women also in­vest more of their in­come into fam­i­lies to ed­u­cate chil­dren and end poverty. “We need to look at how you sup­port women’s em­pow­er­ment and job cre­ation,” Li, for­merly of China’s Min­istry of Fi­nance, told a news con­fer­ence at UNIDO’s 17th Gen­eral Con­fer­ence in Vi­enna. “Lots of projects like agro-industry are re­lated to women’s em­pow­er­ment . . . and one part of our eval­u­a­tion is to look at women’s em­pow­er­ment, at train­ing, at jobs, all those things that are very con­crete mea­sures.” Li was widely praised in his first term in of­fice for re-es­tab­lish­ing UNIDO as an im­por­tant de­vel­op­ment organisation in the UN sys­tem with its mis­sion to pro­mote industry as a driver to cre­ate jobs, boost pros­per­ity, and re­duce poverty glob­ally. As one of 15 spe­cialised UN agen­cies, some coun­tries had ques­tioned UNIDO’s pur­pose and ef­fec­tive­ness in re­duc­ing poverty with some na­tions with­draw­ing fund­ing in­clud­ing Bri­tain, the United States, Aus­tralia, Canada and France. Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of mem­ber states, how­ever, said Li had changed the fo­cus to sup­port de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, find ways to build sus­tain­able, en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly busi­nesses us­ing fewer re­sources, less energy and gen­er­at­ing less waste. He also en­cour­aged pub­lic and pri­vate and lo­cal and international part­ner­ships, with ex­am­ples of UNIDO’s 860 or so projects un­der­way in­clud­ing set­ting up agro-in­dus­trial parks and in­tro­duc­ing clean tan­ning tech­nol­ogy to In­dian leather. “We set an agenda,” said Li, ac­knowl­edg­ing that mem­ber states had wanted more international vis­i­bil­ity for UNIDO. “We in­creased de­liv­ery and the eval­u­a­tion,” he said, adding that this had at­tracted more fund­ing from var­i­ous sources. One of the UN’s latest global goals — the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals — ac­knowl­edges in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion as a key driver of sus­tained eco­nomic sustainability and pros­per­ity. Li said poverty, em­ploy­ment and hunger re­mained ma­jor chal­lenges, ex­ac­er­bated by cli­mate change, re­source de­ple­tion, en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion and the po­ten­tial im­pact of new tech­nol­ogy which will cut jobs, with women to be worst hit. “The core mis­sion of UNIDO has never been more relevant than to­day,” Li told the Gen­eral Con­fer­ence. “My dream is to give young peo­ple liv­ing in such poor con­di­tions as I ex­pe­ri­enced in my child­hood an op­por­tu­nity to play a part — like me — in the global fight against poverty.” — Reuters.",津巴布韦

In his ad­dress at the 2018 Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) in Bei­jing, China, the Pres­i­dent said his ad­min­is­tra­tion would ac­cel­er­ate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, mod­erni­sa­tion and mech­a­ni­sa­tion of the econ­omy. He said this would en­sure Zim­babwe be­comes a mid­dle-in­come econ­omy with a per capita in­come of $3 500, in­crease in­vest­ment, de­cent jobs, broad-based em­pow­er­ment, free from poverty and cor­rup­tion by 2030. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said China re­mained Africa’s num­ber one in­vest­ment and trade part­ner and wel­comed the con­tin­ued fund­ing of FOCAC projects, not­ing it am­pli­fies the rise of a diver­si­fied African econ­omy in line with the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area. “Zim­babwe re­mains de­ter­mined to play its part in the re­al­i­sa­tion of en­hanced con­nec­tiv­ity, in­te­gra­tion and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment,” he said. “My Gov­ern­ment is also un­der­tak­ing com­pre­hen­sive eco­nomic re­forms set to im­prove our in­vest­ment cli­mate and en­hance pol­icy clar­ity, con­sis­tency and pre­dictabil­ity.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe was ready to co­op­er­ate with other coun­tries. “We have set out an am­bi­tious and yet achiev­able pro­gramme of mod­ernising our in­fra­struc­ture and en­sur­ing that our roads, rail­way net­work, air con­nec­tiv­ity, ICTs and Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones talk to the re­gion, the con­ti­nent and the world at large,” he said. “We are open to co­op­er­ate with other coun­tries within FOCAC frame­work and the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa ap­plauded FOCAC for pri­ori­tis­ing eco­nomic di­a­logue hinged on mu­tual re­spect. “It is com­mend­able that FOCAC con­tin­ues to pri­ori­tise eco­nomic di­a­logue founded on peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, mu­tual re­spect, friend­ship, com­mon pros­per­ity and in­clu­sive in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment,” he said. “I am de­lighted to join China and my col­leagues as we de­lib­er­ate on ways to scale up co­op­er­a­tion un­der the Sum­mit theme, ‘China and Africa: To­wards an even stronger com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture through win-win co­op­er­a­tion’. “As Zim­babwe, we at­tach great value to strength­en­ing FOCAC mech­a­nisms to leapfrog the col­lec­tive de­vel­op­ment of na­tions on the African con­ti­nent,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe’s econ­omy was agro-based and sus­cep­ti­ble to cli­mate change, but op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­isted in other sec­tors. “As an agro-based econ­omy, we re­main gravely con­cerned with the im­pact of cli­mate change,” he said. “We are ready to ex­pand co­op­er­a­tion on en­vi­ron­men­tal con­ser­va­tion and sus­tain­able re­source util­i­sa­tion. “With one of the largest lithium and coal bed meth­ane re­serves in Africa, my coun­try of­fers enor­mous op­por­tu­ni­ties to be­come a cen­tre for re­search, de­vel­op­ment, ex­ploita­tion and man­u­fac­tur­ing of green en­ergy so­lu­tions.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said ca­pac­ity build­ing was key in the growth of devel­op­ing economies and the fight against poverty. He took the op­por­tu­nity to ap­prise the sum­mit on the July 30 har­monised elec­tions. “Zim­babwe con­ducted its much an­tic­i­pated har­monised gen­eral elec­tions on 30th July 2018,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. “Th­ese were com­mended by in­ter­na­tional ob­servers for be­ing peace­ful, free, fair and trans­par­ent.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160316,Ad­dress politi­ci­sa­tion of hu­man rights now: China,"BEI­JING. — The “sham­ing” of China by hu­man rights record has been a de­fault po­si­tion that cer­tain na­tions of­ten re­treat to. Un­for­tu­nately, for those out­spo­ken crit­ics, rather than strength­en­ing their “cause”, the cur­rent brouhaha lifts the veil on a cul­ture of hypocrisy, ul­te­rior political mo­tives and scape­goat­ing. The United States and 11 other coun­tries ex­pressed con­cern over “wors­en­ing” hu­man rights in China at the Hu­man Rights Coun­cil in Geneva, Switzer­land, on March 10. The ac­cu­sa­tion was provoca­tive. Amer­ica is us­ing this pre­text to at­tack China, de­spite its own lessthan-per­fect record. As such, it is dis­ap­point­ing, al­though not sur­pris­ing, that it con­ve­niently for­got to men­tion the great strides China has achieved in this re­gard. The Hu­man Rights Coun­cil meet­ing co­in­cided with China’s an­nual par­lia­men­tary ses­sion, which might ex­plain why those rais­ing ob­jec­tions did so. Per­haps they were just too busy with the coun­cil to lis­ten to re­ports on poverty al­le­vi­a­tion; ed­u­ca­tional and med­i­cal equity; or ju­di­cial re­form? Th­ese achieve­ments were de­signed for, and felt by, the peo­ple of China. Yet, the self-pro­claimed “hu­man rights guardians” of the world seem loath to ac­knowl­edge them. This “selec­tive blind­ness” is driven by prej­u­dice and the show was put on to serve noth­ing more than political in­ter­ests. Since the na­tions in­volved may have skele­tons in their re­spec­tive cup­boards, they would be best ad­vised to re­mem­ber that adage re­gard­ing stones and glass houses. Take Amer­ica for in­stance, its tor­ture of pris­on­ers, breach of its own cit­i­zens’ pri­vacy, and deep-rooted racism is well doc­u­mented. There is no end to hu­man rights pro­tec­tion for any na­tion, es­pe­cially in a na­tion such as China, which has a large, multi-eth­nic pop­u­la­tion. The move, led by the United States, could be seen as noth­ing more than a re­fusal to un­der­stand China’s big­ger hu­man rights strat­egy and the para­noia on the smaller de­tails could be detri­men­tal to the di­a­logue be­tween China and the West on the wider hu­man rights is­sue.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have seen re­cent eco­nomic gains wiped out and health sys­tems over­whelmed. Nige­ria’s econ­omy is fore­cast to ex­pand 7% this year and 7,3% next, ac­cord­ing to the IMF, although the world­wide drop in oil prices could hurt Africa’s top pro­ducer. And 2014 was the year that saw Nige­ria sur­pass South Africa to be recog­nised as Africa’s big­gest econ­omy. This fol­lowed a re­cal­cu­la­tion of Nige­ria’s GDP data, which had not been prop­erly re­viewed since 1990 and now takes into ac­count emerg­ing sec­tors in­clud­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and the Nol­ly­wood movie in­dus­try. In some ways Nige­ria’s duel with South Africa for con­ti­nen­tal supremacy par­al­lels that of China and the US on the global stage. Although China ap­pears poised to be­come the world’s big­gest econ­omy, Americans are far wealth­ier per capita.

zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20200724,"Why should losses be so­cialised, gains pri­va­tised?","THERE is a con­sen­sus on what is re­quired to re­vive South Africa’s eco­nomic growth across busi­ness, labour, the public sec­tor, civil so­ci­ety, and po­lit­i­cal par­ties. All sec­tors agree on an in­fra­struc­ture-led eco­nomic growth as a nec­es­sary con­di­tion for solv­ing the triple chal­lenges of un­em­ploy­ment, poverty and in­equal­ity. There is also an agree­ment on the over­due need for fun­da­men­tal trans­for­ma­tion. Yet there seems to be no com­mon view on what this ex­actly en­tails and how to ef­fect it. Hence, the ob­vi­ous di­ver­gence on how many roles the state must play in the post-Covid-19 eco­nomic setup. The pri­vate sec­tor largely takes the achieve­ment of eco­nomic growth to au­to­mat­i­cally trans­late into trans­for­ma­tion through em­ploy­ment cre­ation. This is shown through the Busi­ness for South Africa (B4SA) re­port, which sug­gests that busi­ness is the pri­mary con­trib­u­tor to the econ­omy while gov­ern­ment’s job is to create a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment through es­tab­lish­ing an en­abling reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment. The Covid-19 pan­demic has put the ideal that large gov­ern­ments are bad for eco­nomic growth on trial, and so far that idea seems guilty of be­ing mis­rep­re­sented. The em­i­nent econ­o­mist, Mar­i­ana Maz­zu­cato, a mem­ber of Pres­i­dent Ramaphosa’s Eco­nomic Ad­vi­sory Coun­cil and ad­vi­sor to sev­eral other gov­ern­ments, re­cently shared on Twit­ter her New York Times col­umn ti­tled “We So­cialise Bailout. We should So­cialise Suc­cesses, Too”. I couldn’t help it but im­me­di­ately think of the pol­icy re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus here at home, and the com­mon view that Gov­ern­ment’s lane must be con­fined to cre­at­ing a con­ducive reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment for the pri­vate sec­tor to thrive. If the pri­vate sec­tor thrives, jobs will be cre­ated and poverty, un­em­ploy­ment and in­equal­ity will be re­duced, so the nar­ra­tive goes. For some rea­son, the pol­i­cy­mak­ers con­tinue to be per­suaded to this idea to which they con­cede, so much that some have even gone as far as say­ing that their view is that the state must play a big­ger role in di­rect­ing the econ­omy and not nec­es­sar­ily run­ning it. To be sure, the African Na­tional Congress’ dis­cus­sion doc­u­ment says that Covid-19 has le­git­imised a greater and more ac­tive role of the state in guid­ing the econ­omy. Guid­ing the econ­omy, not driv­ing it. This is what B4SA ad­vo­cates for: the state must guide but not drive eco­nomic growth. This po­si­tion should be re-looked at for sev­eral rea­sons. First, the trickle-down nar­ra­tive to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion has not worked since the dawn of democ­racy. Un­em­ploy­ment has re­mained stub­bornly high and poverty lev­els have gone up, although the econ­omy has grown. What’s more, in­come and wealth in­equal­ity has widened. The pri­vate sec­tor, which is pri­mar­ily the source in­come earned by work­ers, has failed to en­sure a more eq­ui­table pay across gen­der and race. A 2019 Stats SA In­equal­ity Trends In South Africa re­port showed that labour in­come con­trib­utes to 85 per­cent of in­come in­equal­ity. Con­se­quently, the cre­ation of wealth has fol­lowed sim­i­lar trends to in­come dy­nam­ics. The role of cor­rect­ing this struc­tural flow in the econ­omy can no longer be left to the pri­vate sec­tor, as the record from the past two decades shows it is in­ca­pable of cor­rect­ing its pay prac­tices. Se­condly, as Maz­zu­cato points out, dur­ing times of cri­sis, pol­icy is usu­ally de­signed to al­le­vi­ate the im­pact of shocks but un­in­ten­tion­ally or per­haps by omis­sion, losses are so­cialised while gains are pri­va­tised dur­ing good eco­nomic per­for­mance times. To rec­tify this, Maz­zu­cato pro­poses a cit­i­zen’s div­i­dend that would ac­crue to so­ci­ety out of the sup­port pro­vided to the pri­vate sec­tor. A more ac­tive role Thirdly and more im­por­tantly, in both the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis and now in the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic, gov­ern­ments came to the res­cue of cor­po­rates, house­holds and in­di­vid­u­als. Maz­zu­cato ar­gues that while the gov­ern­ment is called upon to the res­cue, they are usu­ally rel­e­gated to guid­ing the econ­omy through boom years. Surely if gov­ern­ments can steer economies out of re­ces­sions and crises, they can drive growth and de­vel­op­ment dur­ing the re­cov­ery phases. The bind­ing con­straint, ac­cord­ing to a 2017 study by econ­o­mist Ed Dolan, is not the size of gov­ern­ment, as I be­lieved when I was an un­der­grad­u­ate and as the crit­ics of big gov­ern­ment ar­gue; it is the qual­ity of gov­ern­ment and its spend­ing that is most cru­cial. Dolan finds that large gov­ern­ments are usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with a higher qual­ity of in­sti­tu­tions and ad­min­is­tra­tion, which cre­ates an am­ple op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment for pri­vate busi­nesses to op­er­ate. In the South African case, what needs to change is the qual­ity of spend­ing, not nec­es­sar­ily the size of gov­ern­ment. If, for in­stance, the large bloated public sec­tor were to re­duce with the sav­ings de­ployed in fund­ing re­search or in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment, the re­sult will be far bet­ter than what we cur­rently have. Lastly, the idea that in­vest­ment in public in­fra­struc­ture and ed­u­ca­tion is a cost needs to be done away with, for without th­ese the pri­vate sec­tor will not func­tion ef­fi­ciently, if at all. A bet­ter way to char­ac­terise this spend­ing should be adopted, and per­haps even the pri­vate sec­tor will ap­proach its in­vest­ment in public in­fra­struc­ture dif­fer­ently. When all is said and done, it’s not the size of gov­ern­ment but the qual­ity of its man­power, in­sti­tu­tions and cap­i­tal al­lo­ca­tion that mat­ters. The state’s in­ca­pac­ity has been widely recog­nised, but how do we create this ca­pac­ity? One se­nior cit­i­zen sug­gested look­ing at Asia, in par­tic­u­lar Hong Kong, where new laws from main­land China are push­ing their cit­i­zens out. They are dy­namic, en­tre­pre­neur­ial and crit­i­cally skilled, which is what South Africa lacks. ◆ This ar­ti­cle first ap­peared on Fin24.

The ques­tion is, are we learn­ing from the past ex­pe­ri­ence? My ar­gu­ment is purely aca­demic, and I am ar­gu­ing from a class­room sit­u­a­tion and setup, shar­ing this con­ver­sa­tion with my MBA stu­dents in Harare. Our mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties and eco­nomic plan­ners have be­come so pop­u­lar and well known of com­ing up with home­grown eco­nomic so­lu­tions, eco­nomic poli­cies and mon­e­tary in­stru­ments, rang­ing from bearer’s cheques, bond coins to bond notes now. Are th­ese not symp­toms of the eco­nomic chal­lenges we are fac­ing? Do we need to ad­dress symp­toms or causes of the prob­lems? Af­ter hav­ing been so in­no­va­tive and come up with th­ese poli­cies and mon­e­tary in­stru­ments, the Gov­ern­ment min­is­ters and pol­icy mak­ers would spend their en­er­gies on try­ing to de­mys­tify, that is, ex­plain­ing and mak­ing sim­ple the un­der­stand­ing of th­ese things. There is con­fu­sion sur­round­ing the bond notes right now, there was con­fu­sion sur­round­ing bond coins and other poli­cies. So much time was spent in an ef­fort to de­mys­tify th­ese poli­cies and in­no­va­tive in­stru­ments, while lit­tle at­ten­tion was given to the real causes of the prob­lems. We just need to ask from the past if bear­ers’ cheques work? Will the bond notes work? I have no an­swer to th­ese ques­tions, but what I know is that cer­tainly, th­ese are just symp­toms of deep rooted prob­lems of the econ­omy. Zim­babwe needs a de­ci­sive raft of econ­omy re­forms now. Econ­omy re­form has tremen­dous po­ten­tial for the eco­nomic growth of a coun­try. Eco­nomic re­form helps en­hance the liv­ing stan­dard of a coun­try’s peo­ple. China has been the most suc­cess­ful of all coun­tries in terms of de­vel­op­ment from eco­nomic re­forms. Dur­ing the re­form pe­riod of 1979 to 2005, China has reg­is­tered an av­er­age GDP growth rate of 9,6 per­cent. In 2002, per capita GDP in China neared US$1 000. Th­ese are clear in­di­ca­tions that China is at the cross­roads of a new pe­riod of eco­nomic growth. There are spec­u­la­tions that China, in the near fu­ture may as­sume the sta­tus of the largest econ­omy of the world. China’s eco­nomic re­form that started in 1978 for ex­am­ple, was ini­ti­ated to gen­er­ate sur­plus funds for mod­erni­sa­tion of the Chi­nese econ­omy. At the be­gin­ning, the eco­nomic re­form was ini­ti­ated to in­cite work­ers and cul­ti­va­tors of China to grow larger sur­pluses and erad­i­cate eco­nomic im­bal­ances. The eco­nomic re­form in China has helped mil­lions of Chi­nese peo­ple over­come poverty. In 1981, the poverty rate in China dropped to 53 per­cent. In 2001, the poverty rate in China was eight per­cent. Eco­nomic re­form can also help Zim­babwe to emerge strong from the eco­nomic cri­sis. Zim­babwe needs to ini­ti­ate some eco­nomic re­form now. Ev­ery coun­try goes through some eco­nomic per­for­mance cy­cle. There are times for a re­ces­sion and times for eco­nomic boom. What mat­ters is how the eco­nomic plan­ners re­spond to each phe­nom­e­non, and aim at last­ing eco­nomic so­lu­tions. It is quite en­cour­ag­ing to learn that Zim­babwe’s for­eign debt pay­ments are on track to­wards the suc­cess of the Lima Agree­ment, signed be­tween the Gov­ern­ment and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) last year. Gov­ern­ment had com­mit­ted it­self to this debt clear­ance strat­egy by the first half of this year (2016). The eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in Zim­babwe is be­ing se­verely con­strained by tight liq­uid­ity con­di­tions that have re­sulted from limited ex­ter­nal liq­uid­ity in­flows (com­modi­ties ex­port earn­ings and di­as­pora re­mit­tances), the coun­try has also seen in­fla­tion re­main­ing in the neg­a­tive phe­nom­e­non be­cause of the ap­pre­ci­at­ing US dol­lar. The clear­ing of debt ar­rears and the ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion of pub­lic ex­pen­di­ture by im­ple­ment­ing the rec­om­men­da­tions from the 2015 civil ser­vice au­dit are pos­i­tive mea­sures that would un­lock for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment and lines of credit that the coun­try needs to re­sus­ci­tate its pro­duc­tive sec­tors, in or­der to re­duce heavy de­pen­dence on im­ports in or­der to meet do­mes­tic con­sump­tion de­mand. How­ever, in ad­di­tion to th­ese mea­sures high­lighted above the last­ing so­lu­tion to the coun­try’s eco­nomic chal­lenges is a raft of eco­nomic re­forms such as fur­ther lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the econ­omy to at­tract both do­mes­tic and for­eign in­vest­ment; en­cour­age­ment of pri­vati­sa­tion of Gov­ern­ment paras­tatals; pro­mo­tion of value added ex­port ori­ented growth; en­cour­age­ment of for­eign cap­i­tal in­flows (in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial lend­ing) and tech­nolo­gies; safe­guard­ing of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights; ini­ti­at­ing a sound cli­mate for im­ple­ment­ing le­gal con­tracts (bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral ar­range­ments and agree­ments); and en­sur­ing re­spect for pri­vate prop­erty rights. Al­though African coun­tries have lagged be­hind in reap­ing the ben­e­fits of eco­nomic re­forms, yet sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ment has been made in re­cent years, af­ter the on­set of the 21st cen­tury. In Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa for ex­am­ple, the eco­nomic re­form pro­grams were in­sti­tuted with the aid of In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions (IFIs), 5,1 per­cent growth in GDP has been reg­is­tered in 2004. Onethird of the non-oil pro­duc­ing African coun­tries for ex­am­ple, in­clud­ing coun­tries like Ethiopia, Gam­bia, etc., have grown by more than five per­cent in terms of av­er­age real GDP. Per capita real GDP has grown by 2,8 per­cent. Coun­tries like Uganda, Sierra Leone, Tan­za­nia and Ghana have con­tin­ued their high growth. Zim­babwe is a coun­try in Africa, the coun­try can­not sur­vive eco­nom­i­cally in iso­la­tion. When China was still a closed econ­omy, that is, with an in­ward look­ing and com­mand eco­nomic sys­tem, it suf­fered se­ri­ous re­ces­sion and stunted growth, un­til san­ity pre­vailed. In­ward look­ing eco­nomic pol­icy may be good for the rea­son that it af­fords the indige­nous peo­ple eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties to par­tic­i­pate in the eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of their coun­try. How­ever, if the pol­icy be­comes the main fo­cus to drive the eco­nomic growth of a de­vel­op­ing coun­try like Zim­babwe, the pol­icy be­comes counter-pro­duc­tive. Ev­ery de­vel­op­ing econ­omy needs in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial sup­port. Zim­babwe can­not be an ex­cep­tion. Zim­babwe needs to some sort of eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. Eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion is one of the most im­por­tant step in eco­nomic re­form. Many de­vel­oped coun­tries around the world have adopted eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion through pri­vati­sa­tion. The Gov­ern­ment has al­lowed to pri­va­tise, par­tially or fully, its prop­er­ties and as­sets. Eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion is char­ac­terised by low cor­po­rate tax rates, less re­stric­tion on for­eign and do­mes­tic cap­i­tal, and labour mar­ket flex­i­bil­ity. In the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, like In­dia, China, Brazil etc, the term eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion fo­cuses more on open­ing their mar­ket to the for­eign or na­tional big in­vestors. Through eco­nomic lib­er­al­i­sa­tion, th­ese coun­tries have achieved a sus­tained eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial growth. In con­clu­sion, there is need to guide the econ­omy and avoid mea­sures which will see the econ­omy get­ting worse.

There is a rich agenda of ur­ban trans­port poli­cies that are both pro-growth and pro-poor, yet which are con­sis­tent with the fis­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties of even the poor­est coun­tries.” The as­ser­tion by the World Bank dove­tails with the pol­icy of the Govern­ment in mak­ing sure that peo­ple, in both ur­ban and ru­ral ar­eas, ac­cess af­ford­able trans­port. This is also in sync with the Govern­ment’s eco­nomic blue­print, the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Programme, which says; “An ef­fi­cient and ad­e­quate trans­port sys­tem is crit­i­cal for the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try, pro­vid­ing ac­cess to mar­kets in­clud­ing re­duc­ing re­gional dis­par­i­ties. The road, rail and air sub-sec­tors are crit­i­cal in rapid in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and agri­cul­tural ad­vance­ment as they fa­cil­i­tate trade and move­ment of goods and peo­ple, hence, the need to re­ha­bil­i­tate and up­grade the cur­rent stock of as­sets.” To en­sure that peo­ple par­tic­i­pate in the coun­try’s eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties and are part of ef­forts to turn around the econ­omy, the Govern­ment has been work­ing hard to ca­pac­i­tate Zupco to have ad­e­quate buses to ser­vice the coun­try, at a time when pri­vate trans­port op­er­a­tors are hik­ing fares un­jus­ti­fi­ably, to the detri­ment of the gen­eral pub­lic. The buses un­der the Zupco scheme charge very lit­tle com­pared to pri­vate op­er­a­tors, and they have been a huge relief to work­ers. To show that Govern­ment is com­mit­ted to fur­ther make life more bear­able, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa last week com­mis­sioned 47 new Zupco buses the sec­ond batch un­der the scheme. In April, the Head of State and Govern­ment com­mis­sioned 39 buses while an ad­di­tional 47 has just been cleared at the ports of en­try and will be un­veiled soon. A fur­ther 500 buses from Be­larus are also in the pipe­line. Speak­ing at the com­mis­sion­ing of the buses in Harare, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said the Govern­ment is com­mit­ted to ease trans­port chal­lenges in the coun­try by avail­ing re­li­able and af­ford­able trans­port to the peo­ple in line with the Vi­sion 2030. “My Govern­ment will con­tinue to pri­ori­tise com­pre­hen­sive ur­ban pub­lic trans­port sys­tems to in­crease con­ve­nience, re­li­a­bil­ity and com­fort to the com­mut­ing pub­lic. In or­der to im­prove the trans­port ser­vice as I have said to­day, we are re­leas­ing 47 buses and the dis­tri­bu­tion will be an­nounced by Zupco. In ad­di­tion to these 47 that are be­ing re­leased to­day, we have an­other 47 al­ready paid for and are at the bor­der.

China Pub­lic Diplo­macy As­so­ci­a­tion vice pres­i­dent Mr Gong Jianzhong last week told jour­nal­ists from sev­eral African coun­tries that the bi­ased re­port­ing was a huge cause for con­cern from both sides. The jour­nal­ists are here on a 10-month study, where they are tak­ing lec­tures at Ren­min Univer­sity of China School of Jour­nal­ism and Com­mu­ni­ca­tion. “We should break the dom­i­na­tion of the Western me­dia in Africa and in China,” said Mr Gong. “If you look at world me­dia re­port­ing on Africa, its im­pact is that many or­di­nary Chi­nese peo­ple will say Africa is about poverty and dis­ease. “Is that all about Africa? No! I was in a num­ber of African coun­tries and was im­pressed by the de­vel­op­ment of their cul­ture, the spirit of the peo­ple and the rich coun­tries.” Mr Gong said Africa had abun­dant re­sources and hard­work­ing peo­ple, but that was sel­dom re­ported by the Western me­dia. He said un­til re­cently, bi­ased Western me­dia re­ports on Africa were the source of most Chi­nese me­dia re­ports un­til the coun­try de­cided to have some OF its me­dia per­son­nel sta­tioned in coun­tries on the con­ti­nent. Mr Gong said it was im­por­tant to note that African coun­tries would find it dif­fi­cult to es­tab­lish bu­reaus in China, be­cause of lack of re­sources, but that should not stop co­op­er­a­tion among the me­dia from both sides. He said the slave trade was a tragedy for Africa, as it broke the cul­tural strength that used to ex­ist in coun­tries on the con­ti­nent. De­spite that dis­rup­tion, African cul­ture re­mained strong, though it could have been at a higher level had there been no slave trade. “China is very strong be­cause of its strong and un­in­ter­rupted cul­ture,” said Mr Gong. “We learnt from our an­ces­tors, that is why the Chi­nese are al­ways united in fight­ing to­gether to pre­vent in­va­sion by for­eign coun­tries. “We do not want to see Chi­nese cul­ture be­com­ing sim­i­lar to that of Bri­tain or the United States. They should have their own cul­ture and we have our own to make the world colour­ful. Like­wise, Africa’s cul­ture and his­tory are very im­por­tant to the con­ti­nent.

It is clear that Africa is reap­ing ben­e­fits from its close ties with China, es­pe­cially with the pri­vate sec­tor in the Asian coun­try tak­ing more in­ter­est on the con­ti­nent. Ac­cord­ing to The Diplo­mat mag­a­zine, Chi­nese loans are up­lift­ing the African con­ti­nent at an un­prece­dented rate. The mag­a­zine notes that be­tween 2000 and 2014, al­most 50 per­cent of Chi­nese loans fi­nanced the two big­gest sec­tors in Africa — trans­porta­tion and en­ergy. Trans­porta­tion (mainly roads and rail­ways) re­ceived $24,2 bil­lion of loans, while the en­ergy sec­tor, mainly elec­tric­ity, got $17,6 bil­lion. Dur­ing that time, the most out­stand­ing projects un­der­taken by the Chi­nese in­cluded the Phase I of Kenya’s Mom­basa-Nairobi Stan­dard Gauge Rail­way funded by $3,6 bil­lion of loans. The Ad­dis-Dji­bouti Rail­way was also one of the ma­jor projects be­ing funded by a $2,5 bil­lion loan. The rail­way was com­mis­sioned re­cently and Chi­nese firms have since moved in to es­tab­lish in­dus­trial parks along the line to add value. What has been the ma­jor drive be­hind this suc­cess­ful co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa? The an­swer lies in the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant’s re­al­i­sa­tion that Africa faces the same predica­ment that it faced nearly 40 years ago. Since China em­barked on a devel­op­ment model that em­pha­sised on in­fras­truc­ture devel­op­ment to back its in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process, its for­tunes have taken a new turn. The devel­op­ment mir­a­cle that China is known to be is mainly at­trib­uted to its ag­gres­sive poli­cies which pro­moted in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. The panacea to Africa’s devel­op­ment, just like China’s nearly four decades ago, is at­tain­ing in­dus­trial growth. To at­tain the de­vel­op­men­tal goals for Africa, China has in­sisted that it will not dic­tate to the African coun­tries on the eco­nomic growth path they should take. Coun­tries on the con­ti­nent are chart­ing their own de­vel­op­men­tal paths, and China will only in­ter­vene when asked to make its con­tri­bu­tion. Speak­ing at the Fo­cac sum­mit in South Africa, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping noted that this de­vel­op­men­tal model will en­sure that Africa’s devel­op­ment is un­stop­pable. “Africa has ac­tively ad­vanced in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and pur­sued sus­tain­able self-devel­op­ment,” he said. “Such a mo­men­tum of rapid growth is un­stop­pable. We in China, both the gov­ern­ment and peo­ple, heartily re­joice over and are proud of Africa’s achieve­ments. We sin­cerely wish African coun­tries and peo­ple greater achieve­ments and an even brighter fu­ture in pur­su­ing devel­op­ment and progress.” What has made the co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa more suc­cess­ful is be­cause the two have “al­ways been guided by the prin­ci­ple of treat­ing each other as equals, pro­mot­ing win-win progress and com­mon devel­op­ment and en­hanc­ing sin­cere friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion”, ac­cord­ing to Pres­i­dent Xi. China has al­ways em­pha­sised on ad­her- ing to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith when deal­ing with Africa. The Asian eco­nomic gi­ant also says it strives to up­hold the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests, while em­brac­ing a new era of win-win co­op­er­a­tion and com­mon devel­op­ment. It was at the Fo­cac sum­mit, where Pres­i­dent Xi charted the new type of China-Africa strate­gic part­ner­ship and up­graded it to “a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic and co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship”. Pres­i­dent Xi an­nounced five ma­jor pil­lars that will de­ter­mine China-Africa re­la­tions hence forth. Po­lit­i­cal equal­ity and mu­tual trust Pres­i­dent Xi noted that a high de­gree of po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust was the foun­da­tion of China-Africa friend­ship. “We should re­spect each other’s choice of devel­op­ment path and not im­pose one’s own will on the other,” he said. “On is­sues in­volv­ing core in­ter­ests and ma­jor con­cerns of each side, we should show mu­tual un­der­stand­ing, sup­port each other and jointly up­hold eq­uity and jus­tice.” China strongly be­lieves that Africa be­longs to the African peo­ple and that African af­fairs should be de­cided by the African peo­ple, he said. Win-win eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion China has pledged to fa­cil­i­tate Africa’s devel­op­ment en­deav­ours and ul­ti­mately de­liver win-win progress and com­mon devel­op­ment through mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi said there should be a full lever­age on the strengths of po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust and eco­nomic com­ple­men­tar­i­ties be­tween China and Africa, and fo­cus on in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion, as well as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. “By do­ing so, we can deepen China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion in all ar­eas and bring its ben­e­fits to our peo­ples,” he said. Mu­tu­ally en­rich­ing cul­tural ex­changes Pres­i­dent Xi’s catch­phrase on this fac­tor was: “di­ver­sity makes the world beau­ti­ful”. “We are proud that both China and Africa have time-hon­oured and splen­did civil­i­sa­tions,” he said. “We should strengthen cul­tural ex­changes and mu­tual learn­ing be­tween China and Africa. Fa­cil­i­tate more ex­changes be­tween the youths, women, think tanks, me­dia, uni­ver­si­ties and other sec­tors of the two sides.” This ex­change will also in­clude the pro­mo­tion of cul­tural in­ter­ac­tions, pol­icy co­or­di­na­tion and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes to ad­vance com­mon progress and en­sure the sus­tained growth of China-Africa friend­ship from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion, he said. Mu­tual as­sis­tance in se­cu­rity The best way to guar­an­tee peace is to fight poverty be­cause it is the root cause of chaos, while peace in turn is the guar­an­tee for devel­op­ment. Pres­i­dent Xi noted that “devel­op­ment holds the key to solv­ing all prob­lems”. In that re­gard, China promised to sup­port the “set­tle­ment of African is­sues by Africans in the African way”. “We are of the view that in re­solv­ing se­cu­rity is­sues, both the symp­toms and the root causes must be ad­dressed in a holis­tic way,” said Pres­i­dent Xi. “China stands ready to take an ac­tive part in Africa’s ef­forts in ca­pac­ity-build­ing for main­tain­ing and strength­en­ing peace and se­cu­rity and sup­port Africa in its en­deav­ours to speed up devel­op­ment, erad­i­cate poverty and re­alise durable peace.” Sol­i­dar­ity and co­or­di­na­tion in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs China and Africa have al­ways shared a com­mon po­si­tion on and in­ter­ests in a wide range of in­ter­na­tional is­sues. “We should strengthen con­sul­ta­tion and co­or­di­na­tion so as to make the global gover­nance sys­tem more just and eq­ui­table and up­hold our com­mon in­ter­ests,” said Pres­i­dent Xi. “China will con­tinue to stand up and speak for Africa at the United Na­tions and other fora to sup­port Africa in play­ing a greater role on the world stage.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180310,China to boost ru­ral in­comes,"BEIJING. - Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said on Thurs­day the ru­ral vi­tal­i­sa­tion strat­egy is the lead­ing agenda for gov­ern­ment work on agri­cul­ture, ru­ral ar­eas and ru­ral res­i­dents. Lo­cal au­thor­i­ties should have a pro­found un­der­stand­ing of the strat­egy’s im­por­tance and ne­ces­sity and im­ple­ment it earnestly, Pres­i­dent Xi said as he joined a panel dis­cus­sion with deputies from east China’s Shan­dong Prov­ince at the first ses­sion of the 13th Na­tional People’s Congress. The qual­ity of a moderately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety and so­cial­ist mod­erni­sa­tion is de­ter­mined by agri­cul­tural com­pet­i­tive­ness, ru­ral en­vi­ron­ment and ru­ral in­comes, said Pres­i­dent Xi, also gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee and chair­man of the Cen­tral Mil­i­tary Com­mis­sion. Pres­i­dent Xi urged lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to re-en­er­gise ru­ral in­dus­tries, in­crease in­comes of ru­ral res­i­dents, al­le­vi­ate poverty and en­rich ru­ral life. He pointed out that na­tional food se­cu­rity should be en­sured, agri­cul­tural struc­ture op­ti­mised and es­tab­lish­ment of a mod­ern ru­ral in­dus­try sys­tem quick­ened. China should push for­ward tal­ent vi­tal­i­sa­tion in ru­ral ar­eas, form a vir­tu­ous cir­cle com­pris­ing of pro­fes­sion­als, land, cap­i­tal and in­dus­tries, Pres­i­dent Xi said. Stress­ing cul­tural vi­tal­i­sa­tion in ru­ral ar­eas, Pres­i­dent Xi said ide­o­log­i­cal and moral ed­u­ca­tion as well as pub­lic cul­tural ser­vices should be strength­ened in the coun­try­side. The pres­i­dent un­der­lined eco­log­i­cal vi­tal­i­sa­tion and green de­vel­op­ment in ru­ral ar­eas. The three-year ac­tion plan to im­prove the ru­ral liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment must be im­ple­mented, while the on­go­ing “toi­let rev­o­lu­tion” will be car­ried for­ward. He high­lighted bet­ter gover­nance and strength­ened lead­er­ship of the CPC in ru­ral re­gions to es­tab­lish a mod­ern ad­min­is­tra­tive sys­tem for the ru­ral so­ci­ety. The ru­ral vi­tal­i­sa­tion strat­egy should be car­ried out step by step, and “van­ity projects” should be com­pletely erad­i­cated, he said. Pres­i­dent Xi asked au­thor­i­ties to re­spect the wishes of ru­ral res­i­dents and turn their de­sire for a bet­ter life into a force driv­ing ru­ral vi­tal­i­sa­tion, pro­tect­ing their fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests and bring­ing them com­mon pros­per­ity. Pres­i­dent Xi also stressed the strate­gic im­por­tance of the ocean in China’s pur­suit of high-qual­ity de­vel­op­ment, urg­ing progress in the con­struc­tion of world­class sea­ports, a mod­ern mar­itime in­dus­try sys­tem, and a green and sus­tain­able ma­rine eco­log­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment to push for the build­ing of mar­itime power.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210109,"C’wealth, sanc­tions re­moval top pri­or­ity","RE­JOIN­ING the Com­mon­wealth and seek­ing the re­moval of il­le­gal eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe, prin­ci­pally by the United States (US) and her al­lies, are the top pri­or­i­ties of the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs and In­ter­na­tional Trade this year. Since as­sum­ing of­fice in Novem­ber 2017, the Sec­ond Repub­lic un­der Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has made strides in en­gag­ing and re-en­gag­ing with the rest of the world to fos­ter so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, democ­racy and peace­ful co­ex­is­tence to erad­i­cate poverty Zim­babwe’s for­eign pol­icy en­deav­ours to ad­vance the coun­try’s pol­icy ob­jec­tives on the global arena. The New Dis­pen­sa­tion is mak­ing strides in pro­mot­ing en­gage­ment with rest of the world and pro­mot­ing eco­nomic diplo­macy. The Gov­ern­ment will pri­ori­tise re­join­ing the Com­mon­wealth as a launch­pad to un­lock in­ter­na­tional good­will and sus­tain re-en­gage­ment mile­stones al­ready re­alised through re­sump­tion of po­lit­i­cal di­a­logue with in­ter­na­tional blocs such as the Euro­pean Union (EU). It is en­vis­aged that re­join­ing the Com­mon­wealth will fast track the res­o­lu­tion and rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the out­stand­ing Bi­lat­eral In­vest­ment Pro­mo­tion and Pro­tec­tion Agree­ment (BIPPA) , as well as launch bids to host in­ter­na­tion­ally-ac­cred­ited global events and con­fer­ences. Re­spond­ing to ques­tions e-mailed, Act­ing Sec­re­tary for For­eign Af­fairs and In­ter­na­tional Trade Mrs Beatrice Mutetwa said Zim­babwe was poised to con­tinue play­ing an ac­tive role glob­ally and wished to be a friend of all and en­emy of none. Mrs Mutetwa said the coun­try would con­tinue to re-en­gage with the EU, United King­dom (UK), US and is hope­ful that sanc­tions will be eased and the coun­try will join the Com­mon­wealth. “We are hope­ful that re­la­tions with the out­side world will deepen given that the USA-Zim­babwe, Zim­babwe-EU di­a­logue and Zim­babwe-UK bi­lat­eral po­lit­i­cal con­sul­ta­tions plat­forms for en­gage­ments”. The re­cent en­dorse­ment by the renowned Mo-lbrahim In­dex of African Gov­er­nance which ranked Zim­babwe among the five most im­proved na­tions over the last decade is a clear tes­ti­mony that the coun­try’s re­forms are be­ing un­der­taken se­ri­ously. More­over, just last month, the UK pledged to vac­ci­nate 20 per­cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion (about 3 mil­lion Zim­bab­weans), against the Covid-19 pan­demic when its Com­vax vac­cine be­comes avail­able. Mrs Mutetwa said that is cer­tainly a prospect for the coun­try. “Our en­gage­ments ef­forts are bear­ing fruits,”. At con­ti­nen­tal level Mrs Mutetwa said the coun­try wel­comes the op­er­a­tional­i­sa­tion of African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) that came into ef­fect on Jan­uary 1, 2021. AfCFTA, she said is meant to ac­cel­er­ate in­fra-African trade and boost Africa’s trad­ing po­si­tion in the global mar­ket by strength­en­ing Africa’s com­mon voice and pol­icy space in global trade ne­go­ti­a­tions through mar­ket di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and stream­line bu­reau­cratic pro­cesses that have been im­ped­ing on in­vest­ment and do­ing busi­ness. “The coun­try now has a One Stop In­vest­ment Ser­vices cen­tre un­der the Zim­babwe In­vest­ment and De­vel­op­ment Agency ( ZIDA). “ZIDA con­sol­i­dates and sim­pli­fies the process of reg­is­ter­ing new busi­ness in the coun­try. “All th­ese are cer­tainly big prospects for the coun­try in the year 2021,” she said. In par­al­lel, and be­yond the con­ti­nent, she said: “We have sought to fur­ther strengthen al­ready ex­cel­lent re­la­tions with long stand­ing part­ners such as China, In­dia, Rus­sia, Brazil and so on. His Ex­cel­lency the Pres­i­dent has made of­fi­cial vis­its to China and Rus­sia. High-level vis­i­tors from China, In­dia and Rus­sia have been re­ceived in Zim­babwe. Over and above this, Zim­babwe is ac­tively en­gag­ing new part­ners, open­ing up new fron­tiers for co­op­er­a­tion, trade an in­vest­ment. In this re­gard, she said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa made of­fi­cial vis­its to Be­larus, Azer­bai­jan, Kaza­khstan, Qatar and the United Arab Emi­rates. “In all in­stances, but per­haps most specif­i­cally with Be­larus and UAE, the pos­i­tive out­come of such en­gage­ment is al­ready clear to see. “Even a cur­sory glance at the list of ap­proved for­eign in­vest­ment projects, both al­ready un­der­way and still to be im­ple­mented, bears tes­ti­mony to the suc­cess of His Ex­cel­lency’s en­gage­ment and re- en­gage­ment pol­icy. Not only in terms of the quan­tum of in­vest­ment com­mit­ted and the key sec­tors in which the in­vest­ment is be­ing di­rected, but also in terms of the ori­gin or source of those in­vest­ments,” said Mrs Mutetwa. Nat­u­rally, she said long- stand­ing part­ners such as China, Rus­sia, South Africa, and In­dia fea­ture promi­nently in both ex­ist­ing and com­mit­ted fu­ture in­vest­ment. “But it is the in­ter­est and com­mit­ment man­i­fested by new and re­turn­ing part­ners which so clearly val­i­dates our for­eign pol­icy thrust, part­ners such as Sin­ga­pore, UAE, Tur key, Aus­tralia, France, Oman, Pak­istan, Nether­lands and both the UK and the USA, to name just a few. “Our most vo­cal crit­ics over the past 20 years or so, and those who, in the early 2000s opted to go the puni­tive sanc­tions route, are mainly west­ern coun­tries and their as­so­ci­ated fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. “Re- en­gage­ment with th­ese coun­tries and in­sti­tu­tion specif­i­cally the USA, the UK and the EU more broadly is a crit­i­cally im­por­tant el­e­ment of the New Dis­pen­sa­tion’s for­eign pol­icy. “In all cases doors have been opened to us and we are ac­tively and cor­dially en­gaged. Of course, di­ver­gence re­mains es­pe­cially on the is­sue of sanc­tions and con­tin­u­ing puni­tive mea­sures im­posed on Zim­babwe, but the mere fact that we are talk­ing to rather that at the US, UK and EU ad­min­is­tra­tions rep­re­sents a very sig­nif­i­cant ad­vance on where Zim­babwe stood prior to Novem­ber 2017 “With re­gard to the EU, had it not been for Covid-19, we would al­ready have held our sec­ond min­is­te­rial-level Po­lit­i­cal Di­a­logue, re­cently el­e­vated from the level of se­nior of­fi­cials,”. Progress, she said has been made so far and the at­mos­phere is pos­i­tive and the prospects for yet fur­ther im­prove­ment re­main promis­ing. How­ever, Mrs Mutetwa the big­gest chal­lenges to that progress are sanc­tions.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191019,"State sovereignty, China’s mea­sures against ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism","Like­wise the Zim­bab­wean Govern­ment, in the past, has ini­ti­ated sim­i­lar ef­forts in an ef­fort of bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion. In 2001, it in­tro­duced the Na­tional Youth Ser­vice. This pro­gramme tar­geted youths from the ages of 10 to 30. Its stated pur­pose was to trans­form and em­power youths for na­tion build­ing through life skills train­ing and lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment. It also aimed to in­cul­cate na­tional val­ues, ethos and ethics into the youths thereby bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion . . .” OVER the years the govern­ment of China has im­ple­mented counter-ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism mea­sures in the au­tonomous re­gion of Xin­jiang. These mea­sures have proven to be ef­fec­tive and de­vel­op­men­tal to the peo­ple of Xin­jiang, who had deeply suf­fered from ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism for the past two decades. Some of these mea­sures have man­aged to bring peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the re­gion and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries can bor­row such mea­sures for the de­vel­op­ment of their coun­tries. Xin­jiang (of­fi­cially Xin­jiang Uygur Au­tonomous Re­gion) is the largest prov­ince-level divi­sion of China and the 8th largest sub­di­vi­sion in the World. It is home to over 21 mil­lion peo­ple of dif­fer­ent eth­nic­ity that in­clude the Uygur, Han, Kaza­khs, Ti­betans, Rus­sians, Hui, Ta­jiks, Kyr­gyz, Mon­gols and Xibe. Xin­jiang has been a part of China ever since it ob­tained in­de­pen­dence in 1949, al­though the Mon­gols claim the ter­ri­tory. It gained the sta­tus of au­tonomous re­gion in 1955. In the last decades the in­flu­ence of rad­i­cal Is­lamist, ter­ror­ist at­tacks, eth­nic con­flicts and clashes be­tween sep­a­ratist and govern­ment forces have re­sulted in un­rest in the re­gion. It is re­ported that there had been sev­eral thou­sand cases of vi­o­lent ter­ror­ism in Xin­jiang since the 1990s, and sev­eral thou­sand in­no­cent peo­ple were killed or in­jured. These at­tacks took a heavy toll on the life and prop­erty of the lo­cal peo­ple and their free­dom of re­li­gious be­lief and other fun­da­men­tal hu­man rights. Groups such as the Turk­istan Is­lamic Party have claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for many ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the re­gion and are be­lieved to have links to Al Qaeda. Xin­jiang was also char­ac­terised with spo­radic eth­nic con­flicts be­tween the Han and Uygur eth­nic groups which re­sulted in fur­ther divi­sion and mis­un­der­stand­ing in the re­gion. Hence­forth China’s plan of ac­tion can be seen as an ef­fort to unite its peo­ple cul­tur­ally for the de­vel­op­ment of the na­tion. In a move to bring peace and se­cu­rity to the re­gion and coun­try at large, the govern­ment of China en­acted pre­ven­tive mea­sures aimed at unit­ing the re­gion and pre­vent­ing fur­ther ter­ror­ist at­tacks and eth­nic con­flicts. These mea­sures are in con­form­ity with the laws of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China and global prac­tices. Ac­cord­ing to the UN Plan of Ac­tion to Pre­vent Vi­o­lent Ex­trem­ism, poverty, un­em­ploy­ment, the ab­sence of al­ter­na­tive em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and low lev­els of ed­u­ca­tion are the back­ground causes of vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism along with the dis­tor­tion and ex­ploita­tion by vi­o­lent ex­trem­ist groups of re­li­gious beliefs. The Plan of Ac­tion sug­gests early en­gage­ment and com­ple­ment­ing the ac­tions to counter vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism with pre­ven­tive mea­sures. China im­ple­mented the fa­mous “Trans­for­ma­tion Through Ed­u­ca­tion Plan”. In this course of ac­tion, China en­listed sev­eral thou­sand Xin­jiang res­i­dents into ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing cen­tres in Xin­jiang. Ac­cord­ing to the State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter of China, Wang Yi, these ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing cen­tres are schools that help the peo­ple con­cerned free them­selves from the in­flu­ence of ex­trem­ism and ter­ror­ism, and ac­quire pro­fes­sional skills that will ben­e­fit them. These cen­tres have recorded sig­nif­i­cant progress as there hasn’t been any sin­gle re­port of vi­o­lent ter­ror­ist at­tacks in the past three years. Res­i­dents of Xin­jiang have ex­pressed their ut­ter­most hap­pi­ness with such an ini­tia­tive as it has man­aged to pre­serve peace and se­cu­rity in the re­gion. Var­i­ous western me­dia out­lets and gov­ern­ments have smeared this ini­tia­tive as sim­i­lar to the con­cen­tra­tion camps in World War 2. It can be noted that this is just a mere ef­fort to dis­credit the ini­tia­tives be­ing made by the Chi­nese govern­ment in a bid to bring peace, unity, se­cu­rity, re­li­gious free­dom and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to the re­gion and the na­tion at large. Like­wise the Zim­bab­wean Govern­ment, in the past, has ini­ti­ated sim­i­lar ef­forts in an ef­fort of bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion. In 2001, it in­tro­duced the Na­tional Youth Ser­vice. This pro­gramme tar­geted youths from the ages of 10 to 30. Its stated pur­pose was to trans­form and em­power youths for na­tion build­ing through life skills train­ing and lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment. It also aimed to in­cul­cate na­tional val­ues, ethos and ethics into the youths thereby bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion. Al­though crit­i­cised by the West for gross hu­man rights vi­o­la­tion, the pro­gramme man­aged to cut across racial, re­li­gious, cul­tural and po­lit­i­cal lines cre­at­ing pa­tri­otic Zim­bab­weans ded­i­cated to the de­vel­op­ment and suc­cess of their na­tion. China has over the years con­trib­uted to the suc­cess and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of the re­gion. Wang Yi, in his key­note speech at a din­ner co-hosted by the na­tional com­mit­tee on US-China re­la­tions, US-China Busi­ness Coun­cil, US Cham­ber of Com­merce and Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions in New York, in­di­cated the progress made by the re­gion over the years as a re­sult of the govern­ment’s in­ter­ven­tion in pre­serv­ing its re­li­gion and cul­ture. He in­di­cated that in the past 64 years since the re­gion was es­tab­lished, the lo­cal econ­omy has grown by 80 times and tens of thou­sands of lo­cal peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty. There are now over 28 000 re­li­gious sites in Xin­jiang, and close to 30 000 cler­i­cal per­son­nel. Both fig­ures have in­creased by ten­fold com­pared with sev­eral decades ago. Nowa­days, ev­ery 530 Mus­lim peo­ple in Xin­jiang have a mosque on av­er­age, which is higher than many Mus­lim coun­tries. All this de­vel­op­ment can be at­trib­uted to the stern ef­forts be­ing done by the Chi­nese govern­ment. How­ever, where there is some­thing pos­i­tive there are other el­e­ments that want to por­tray the neg­a­tive. So is the case of 22 western coun­tries who wrote to the UN Hu­man Rights Coun­cil crit­i­cis­ing China on the Xin­jiang case. 50 coun­tries, in­clud­ing ma­jor Is­lamic coun­tries, and the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Is­lamic Co­op­er­a­tion have backed China’s of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive in a signed let­ter to the UN, but among the 22 coun­tries that have signed the com­pet­ing let­ter sup­port­ing the western nar­ra­tive none were Is­lamic which goes on to show the ma­li­cious in­ten­tions of the western nar­ra­tive. The prin­ci­ple of state sovereignty in­di­cates that each state has the con­trol to de­ter­mine events and poli­cies in its ter­ri­tory. China ex­er­cised such con­trol as a way of bring­ing peace and se­cu­rity to its peo­ple and those el­e­ments that say oth­er­wise are ei­ther try­ing to tar­nish the good deeds be­ing done by China or have a hid­den agenda. Med­dling in the in­ter­nal af­fairs of China not only wors­ens re­la­tions be­tween China and those na­tions, but de­stroys the global agenda of pro­mot­ing unity and re­spect of fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ples. Re­cently the US has im­posed visa re­stric­tions on Chi­nese govern­ment and Com­mu­nist party of­fi­cials ac­cused of be­ing in­volved in the mass in­tern­ment of more than a mil­lion Uyghurs and other Mus­lim mi­nor­ity groups in Xin­jiang prov­ince. The re­stric­tions, an­nounced by the US state depart­ment on Tues­day, come a day af­ter the US com­merce depart­ment im­posed ex­port re­stric­tions on US com­pa­nies pre­vent­ing them from sell­ing their prod­ucts — par­tic­u­larly face recog­ni­tion and other sur­veil­lance tech­nol­ogy — to 28 Chi­nese en­ti­ties, in­clud­ing the Pub­lic Se­cu­rity Bureau and firms in­volved in sur­veil­lance in Xin­jiang. In the same vein the US govern­ment and other western coun­tries im­posed sanc­tions on Zim­babwe thereby crip­pling its econ­omy and bring­ing chaos and may­hem to what was once the bread bas­ket of Africa. These sanc­tions not only show the ill-in­ten­tions of the US govern­ment, but show that this is their way of ac­tion into med­dling into the in­ter­nal af­fairs of coun­tries thereby vi­o­lat­ing state sovereignty. China’s pre­ven­tive mea­sures against ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism are com­mend­able as it was a nec­es­sary ac­tion in bring­ing peace and se­cu­rity to the Xin­jiang Au­tonomous re­gion.",津巴布韦

Over the past 67 years, es­pe­cially since the start of the re­form and open­ing up in 1978, un­der the lead­er­ship of the Com­mu­nist Party of China, the Chi­nese peo­ple of all eth­nic groups have forged ahead against all odds and suc­ceeded in turn­ing a once poor and weak coun­try into the world’s sec­ond big­gest econ­omy. “The Chi­nese na­tion, once bul­lied and hu­mil­i­ated, is now well on the way to­wards great re­ju­ve­na­tion. The Chi­nese peo­ple, once short of food and cloth­ing, are mov­ing to­wards a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in an all- round way,” Li said. The G20 sum­mit that con­cluded early last month in the eastern Chi­nese city of Hangzhou has left a Chi­nese mark in the G20 his­tory. In ad­di­tion, China’s Tian­gong2 space lab blasted off on Septem­ber 15, marked an­other mile­stone in its in­creas­ingly am­bi­tious space programme, which en­vi­sions a mission to Mars by the end of this decade and its own space sta­tion by around 2020. Great changes have also taken place since China drew up the out­line for its 13th five- year plan on eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. Com­pre­hen­sive re­forms have been car­ried out to en­sure that peo­ple equally share the pro­ceeds of such re­forms and re­main sat­is­fied. As China is still a de­vel­op­ing coun­try, it needs a sta­ble environment both at home and on its doorstep to sus­tain growth. At a mas­sive mil­i­tary pa­rade on Septem­ber 3 last year to mark the 70th an­niver­sary of the end of World War II and the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s War of Re­sis­tance Against Ja­panese Ag­gres­sion, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping high­lighted China’s as­pi­ra­tions for peace while an­nounc­ing a re­duc­tion in the num­ber of mil­i­tary troops by 300 000. “China will re­main com­mit­ted to peace­ful de­vel­op­ment. We Chi­nese love peace. No mat­ter how much stronger we may be­come, China will never seek hege­mony or ex­pan­sion. It will never in­flict its past suf­fer­ing on any other na­tion,” Xi said. In the diplo­matic sphere, Xi has been ad­vo­cat­ing a global com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture. A se­ries of projects, in­clud­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank, serve to highlight China as a re­spon­si­ble and ac­tive player in global de­vel­op­ment. Look­ing for­ward, eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment will con­tinue to be China’s cen­tral mission.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200611,COVID-19 lock­down spawns child mar­riages,"IT was COVID-19 that en­sured that Nancy (not her real name)’s sec­ond year as a teenager would also be the first year of her mar­ried life. Up to the time lock­down was eased, her par­ents, who live at a farm in Mhon­doro-Ngezi in Mashona­land West prov­ince, had been forced to scrounge for a liv­ing. They had been sur­viv­ing by scav­eng­ing for fire­wood to sell in Chegutu town, but their trade was cut short, con­demn­ing the fam­ily to poverty. So when Mvukwe (65), a lo­cal busi­ness­man, ap­proached her fam­ily to ask for the 14-year-old’s hand in mar­riage, they could not think twice, lest their po­ten­tial son-in-law looked else­where. Nancy could have none of it. She was still young to nav­i­gate the rough ter­rain of mar­riage, a polyg­a­mous one for that mat­ter, she pleaded, but her pleas fell on deaf ears. “We did not want her to be mar­ried at that age, but be­cause of cir­cum­stances, we had to sit her down and spell it out to her,” Nancy’s fa­ther told News­Day re­cently. “The fact that we knew how ‘rich’ Mvukwe was; we knew our daugh­ter was guar­an­teed a de­cent life. We are also as­sured of a ‘bailout’ dur­ing this cri­sis time,” added the 54-year-old fa­ther of nine, and a mem­ber of Jo­hanne Marange apos­tolic sect. In­ces­sant droughts, owing to cli­mate change have con­demned many a fam­ily, es­pe­cially in the ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties to poverty. Zim­babwe’s poor per­form­ing econ­omy — rav­aging in­fla­tion, soar­ing prices and short­age of ba­sic com­modi­ties — have wors­ened the plight of many. With the coro­n­avirus-in­duced lock­down freez­ing their source of liveli­hoods, there was noth­ing to eat. Nancy’s par­ents could not af­ford an­other mouth at the ta­ble, so Nancy had to be sac­ri­ficed. “The de­ci­sion to let go of my daugh­ter was not an easy one, but a choice in the col­lec­tive in­ter­est of the fam­ily had to be made,” Si­gauke added. Her case mir­rors that of many un­der­priv­i­leged girls. Cen­tre for Women Against Abuse (CWAA), an or­gan­i­sa­tion that works with women and girls in Mashona­land West prov­ince noted that the COVID-19 pan­demic had cre­ated many chal­lenges, es­pe­cially for women and girls. “Many young girls, in­clud­ing those with phys­i­cal dis­abil­i­ties face sig­nif­i­cant risks due to coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­stric­tions. Stay­ing at home comes with fi­nan­cial pres­sures, dis­con­nec­tion from sup­port net­works and height­ened stress have ex­ac­er­bated the un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions that lead to the es­ca­la­tion of early and forced child mar­riages,” CWAA di­rec­tor Muchadzireva Bu­rukai said in a re­port last week. The re­port noted that deep­en­ing poverty owing to loss of liveli­hoods brought about by COVID-19 drove many fam­i­lies to marry off their un­der-age daugh­ters. This comes de­spite Zim­babwe out­law­ing child mar­riages in 2016. “To nav­i­gate dif­fi­cul­ties brought about by COVID-19, most fam­i­lies and guardians are mar­ry­ing off their young girls as a sur­vival mech­a­nism,” the re­port added. The CWAA di­rec­tor added that, just like the Nancy case, some par­ents marry off girls to re­duce the num­ber of chil­dren they have to sup­port or to ac­cess bailouts in the form of lobola. “It is usu­ally a sur­vival mech­a­nism. Some par­ents are not do­ing it out of choice; they just do not have any al­ter­na­tive,” Bu­rukai added. Ex­tended school hol­i­days due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ex­posed many girls to abuse, noted African Union good­will am­bas­sador for the cam­paign to end child mar­riages, Nyaradzayi Gum­bonz­vanda. “Schools al­ways pro­tect girls; they pro­vide sanc­tu­ar­ies to young girls. When schools are closed, the risks of such mar­riages be­come high,” Gum­bonz­vanda, who is also Rozaria Memo­rial Trust chief ex­ec­u­tive, said. “They (girls) can ac­cess sup­port when they are at school, but given the lock­down re­stric­tions, sup­port or­gan­i­sa­tions have had dif­fi­cul­ties to reach, es­pe­cially re­mote parts of the coun­try which are in­fested with such vices.” The clear pic­ture of the car­nage caused by the COVID-19 pan­demic is only be­gin­ning to take shape, but ex­perts es­ti­mate the hu­man cost, es­pe­cially on vul­ner­a­ble groups such as girls, women and peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, could be dis­as­trous. A United Na­tions re­port re­leased in April pre­dicted that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has claimed more than 414 200 lives glob­ally since the dis­ease was dis­cov­ered in China last year, could lead to an ex­tra 13 mil­lion child mar­riages over the next decade. In a Jan­uary to May 2020 re­port for Murewa and Shamva, Rozaria Memo­rial Trust noted that the two dis­tricts reg­is­tered a no­table in­crease in phys­i­cal and sex­ual abuse dur­ing the lock­down pe­riod. Zim­babwe has been on lock­down since May 30. “In times of cri­sis such as a war or con­flict, rates of child mar­riages and other abuse of women usu­ally go up,” Gum­bonz­vanda said. She added that the lock­down, which was ex­tended in­def­i­nitely by Pres­i­dent Emmerson Mnan­gagwa, was mak­ing it dif­fi­cult for girls to ac­cess re­pro­duc­tive health ser­vices, lead­ing to a surge in teenage preg­nan­cies, which in turn re­sulted in in­creased pres­sure to marry. The Rozaria Memo­rial Trust boss said they were con­cerned that some peo­ple could use the lock­down to con­ceal child mar­riages. Be­cause of stay-at-home guide­lines to curb the spread of the vir­u­lent coro­n­avirus, Zim­babwe is regis­ter­ing a surge in gen­der-based vi­o­lence cases. Msasa Project di­rec­tor Pre­cious Taru said be­fore the lock­down they re­ceived an aver­age of 500 calls per month. “Be­fore the start of the lock­down, as Msasa Project through our call back hot­line calls we were re­ceiv­ing about 500 cases in the whole month. “But in the last two weeks (of the lock­down) alone, we started look­ing at the cases that were com­ing. These are be­ing re­ported by women, young girls and even some men in com­mu­ni­ties talk­ing about the gen­der-based vi­o­lence that they are fac­ing,” she said. “So in that pe­riod, we have re­ceived 818 cases. This means that cases of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence have risen greatly dur­ing this lock­down pe­riod.” Eco­nomic Jus­tice for Women Project di­rec­tor Margaret Mut­samvi said as along as the gov­ern­ment paid lip ser­vice to the pro­vi­sion of safety nests, COVID-19 would breed a gen­er­a­tion of child brides. “The gov­ern­ment needs to im­ple­ment COVID-19 re­spon­sive mea­sures that are gen­der sen­si­tive, tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion that the dis­ease has dif­fer­ent im­pacts on dif­fer­ent gen­ders. As such, chan­nelling more re­sources to­wards sex­ual re­pro­duc­tive health and the safety of girls should be pri­or­i­ties,” she said. She also im­plored the gov­ern­ment to bridge the dig­i­tal gap among young peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly in ex­cluded com­mu­ni­ties, as a way of re­duc­ing child mar­riages as this could pro­mote con­tin­ued ed­u­ca­tion. Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent news re­lease by the United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund and Save the Chil­dren, the eco­nomic im­pact of COVID-19 could push up to 86 mil­lion more chil­dren into poverty by the end of 2020. It urged the gov­ern­ment to in­vest in other forms of so­cial pro­tec­tion, fis­cal poli­cies, em­ploy­ment and labour mar­ket in­ter­ven­tions to sup­port fam­i­lies.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151212,Guns blaze in China’s de­fence,"GUNS blazed this week against Africa’s Euro­pean colonis­ers and neo-colo­nial sec­tions of the world Press in de­fence of the new role that China is play­ing in re­con­struct­ing and re­vamp­ing the economies of a free and in­de­pen­dent Africa. The United Na­tions’ for­mer long-serv­ing po­lit­i­cal ser­vant, James Jonah, came out fir­ing salvo af­ter salvo at Europe for un­der de­vel­op­ing and im­pov­er­ish­ing Africa in the hey-days of coloni­sa­tion. This was against me­dia claims that China was colonis­ing Africa — with Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe also fir­ing his shots at both the for­mer ex­ploiters of Africa’s rich re­sources and at mass me­dia seek­ing to dis­credit China by claim­ing that the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant was a fol­low-up coloniser af­ter Europe. In an in­ter­view with the Voice Of Amer­ica Ra­dio, Jonah, a na­tive of Sierra Leone who served the UN for three decades, re­tir­ing in 1992 as Un­der-Sec­re­tary for Po­lit­i­cal Af­fairs, lauded China’s in­ter­ven­tion in Africa af­ter the plun­der of the con­ti­nent’s riches by colo­nial Europe, say­ing the $60 bil­lion aid China is giv­ing to Africa will be a mile­stone in the ad­vance­ment of the con­ti­nent’s economies. Speak­ing from Johannesburg when at­tend­ing the China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion Sum­mit, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe, who had just hosted China’s Pres­i­dent XI Jing­ping dur­ing a two-day visit to Zim­babwe, said the bil­lions in de­vel­op­ment aid from China would trans­form African economies from be­ing ex­porters of raw ma­te­ri­als to pro­duc­ers of higher value pro­cessed prod­ucts, thereby bring­ing to an end a long-stand­ing colo­nial legacy, which is that long af­ter achiev­ing po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence African coun­tries, through mostly Euro­pean or white-owned com­pa­nies, con­tinue to ex­ploit Africa’s rich raw ma­te­ri­als and ship­ping th­ese over­sees for pro­cess­ing and value ad­di­tion with the added value never see­ing its way back to the sources of the raw ma­te­ri­als. What is even worse is that by ex­port­ing the raw ma­te­ri­als African coun­tries also un­wit­tingly or help­lessly ex­port jobs that their peo­ple badly need for bet­ter lives. Zim­babwe and other Sadc coun­tries are right now work­ing to re­verse the bro­mide of ex­port­ing raw ma­te­ri­als by cre­at­ing sec­ondary in­dus­tries lo­cally to process the ma­te­ri­als into fin­ished prod­ucts for ex­port with value added to them to ben­e­fit the coun­tries, with more jobs cre­ated at home in the process through in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. In ret­ro­spect, this pen dares say if Europe’s colonis­ing of African coun­tries had been like the Chi­nese they would have been cel­e­brated and would have re­mained as friends of Africa ad in­fi­tum. But they were not China. For on top of be­ing eco­nomic ex­ploiters and, to a large ex­tent, racist op­pres­sors of blacks, for some of them were bla­tant crooks, as the story of the par­ti­tion­ing of Africa by the colonis­ers at the Berlin Con­fer­ence in 1884 shows. The book, Dy­nam­ics of History by S Mukanya, ex­plains that the pur­pose of the Berlin Con­fer­ence was to agree prin­ci­ples ac­cord­ing to which Africa was to be di­vided among the colo­nial pow­ers. For in­stance, one of the ma­jor guid­ing prin­ci­ples was that in­tend­ing colo­nial pow­ers must sign treaties with African rulers and must pro­duce ev­i­dence to the oth­ers that it (colo­nial power) had the le­gal right to oc­cupy the area, ac­cord­ing to the dy­nam­ics of history. And here come the stun­ner: “the ma­jor­ity of the doc­u­ments were forg­eries that meant noth­ing to African rulers be­cause the … rulers were il­lit­er­ate… and were per­suaded to put an X on the doc­u­ment and this was treated as the sig­na­ture”. What the doc­u­ment was about was never really ex­plained to the Africans. Now con­trast this with doc­u­ments signed be­tween Chi­nese com­pa­nies and their African coun­ter­parts and no case of fraud has come up be­cause the Chi­nese are guided by their coun­try’s cul­ture of hon­est gen­uine prac­tice and de­sire truly to help strug­gling African coun­tries tran­scend poverty in­duced by decades of coloni­sa­tion by a Europe that brazenly boasted about own­er­ship of African coun­tries. Take, for in­stance, the Congo re­gion which was recog­nised as “be­long­ing to Leopold II of Bel­gium” who then sought an in­ter­na­tional guar­an­tee for that re­gion. Closer to home, this coun­try as Rhode­sia was re­garded by the colo­nial power, Great Bri­tain, as its pos­ses­sion as was the case with other coun­tries colonised by Bri­tain. Por­tu­gal and other Euro­pean pow­ers were also re­gard­ing their colonies as their own pos­ses­sions — and one was free to do or not do any­thing about one’s so-called pos­ses­sions. Thus, trails of un­der-de­vel­oped coun­tries and crush­ing poverty in some of them speak vol­umes about the records of pow­ers that once oc­cu­pied Africa, in some cases by force of arms. Yet no one is known to have heard of a coun­try in post moder­nity that re­gards it­self, or is touted by China as its colony or pos­ses­sion in Africa. For all that Zim­bab­weans know and can vouch to the none African world is that China — the world’s sec­ond most ad­vanced econ­omy af­ter the United States of Amer­ica — boasts a rev­o­lu­tion­ary peo­ple who are now sim­ply cross­ing the bridges they helped build dur­ing the armed strug­gle for in­de­pen­dence in Africa to un­der­pin the revo­lu­tion on the con­ti­nent with eco­nomic growth and with that po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and so­cial ad­vance­ment. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe cited China’s pos­i­tive role in Zim­babwe, for in­stance by stat­ing that Chi­nese com­pa­nies are in­vest­ing in pro­duc­tive sec­tors and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions as a way to lead the coun­try into a brave new fu­ture. Above all, China cher­ishes not only along with Zim­babwe but also with other African coun­tries the prin­ci­ples en­shrined in the Char­ter of the United Na­tions which in­clude those of the equal­ity of na­tions and their right of self-de­ter­mi­na­tion. China can there­fore be said with equa­nim­ity to be play­ing a Good Sa­mar­i­tan role of sorts with, of course, hand­some div­i­dends ac­cru­ing to that coun­try’s com­pa­nies from their in­vest­ments in Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201023,Let’s adopt com­pul­sory re­for­esta­tion for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment,"IF one gen­er­a­tion plants a tree, the next gen­er­a­tion will sit un­der a shade,” says one Chi­nese proverb. One thing you can’t help notic­ing when in Bei­jing, China, other than the high lev­els of in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment is the har­mo­nious, nat­u­ral blend of build­ings, roads and veg­e­ta­tion. Mag­nif­i­cent trees run along­side roads alike and flow­ers brighten the side­walks. One is left to wan­der how in the wake of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion the cap­i­tal has man­aged to main­tain a green en­vi­ron­ment. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has given high pri­or­ity to ur­ban af­foresta­tion since the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China in 1949. In the early 1950s, chair­man Mao Ze­dong ini­ti­ated a cam­paign to pro­mote tree and flower grow­ing through­out the coun­try. The re­sponse was strong, both in terms of spon­ta­neous and planned plant­ing. How­ever, it was recog­nised that fur­ther mea­sures and in­cen­tives were nec­es­sary if tree plant­ing was to keep pace with pop­u­la­tion growth and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. Over the past two decades, leg­is­la­tion and reg­u­la­tions re­lated to both gen­eral and ur­ban tree-plant­ing have pro­lif­er­ated. As a re­sult the cap­i­tal has ex­pe­ri­enced im­pres­sive progress in tree plant­ing over the past 32 years. Its for­est cov­er­age rate has in­creased from 12,83% in 1980 to 38,6% by the end of 2012. The per­cent­age of green cov­er­age in the ur­ban area has risen from 20,08% to 46,2% ac­cord­ing to the Bei­jing Mu­nic­i­pal Bureau of Land­scape and Forestry. Over 32 years more than 78 mil­lion peo­ple have planted more than 189 mil­lion trees with a sur­vival rate of more than 88%. In 1979, the Chi­nese cen­tral com­mit­tee des­ig­nated March 12 as a na­tional tree plant­ing day. In 1981, the fourth ses­sion of the fifth na­tional peo­ple’s congress adopted a “res­o­lu­tion on the un­fold­ing of a na­tion­wide vol­un­tary tree plant­ing cam­paign” This res­o­lu­tion stip­u­lated that ev­ery able-bod­ied cit­i­zen be­tween the ages of 11 and 60 should plant three to five trees per year or do the equiv­a­lent work in seedling, cul­ti­va­tion or pro­vide funds equiv­a­lent to the work re­quired or pay heavy fines. Sup­port­ing doc­u­men­ta­tion in­structs all units to re­port pop­u­la­tion statis­tics to the lo­cal af­foresta­tion com­mit­tees as a ba­sis for work­load al­lo­ca­tion. The tree plant­ing cam­paign was, there­fore, ac­tu­ally com­pul­sory. It is be­lieved that at least one bil­lion trees have been planted in China since 1982. The 1982 pro­vi­sional rules and reg­u­la­tions on the for­est and gar­den man­age­ment of cities de­clare that his­toric, rare and large trees are State prop­erty and that their pres­ence should be doc­u­mented, mar­keted and pro­tected. Tree cut­ting should be done with per­mis­sion from the Bei­jing Forestry Bureau and no­ti­fi­ca­tion of the Bei­jing In­sti­tute of Land­scape and Gar­den­ing and heavy fines are im­posed if trees are cut with­out per­mis­sion. Forests are home to 80% of all ter­res­trial bio­di­ver­sity. The forests of the world sup­ply a sig­nif­i­cant amount of mois­ture that cre­ates rain thus con­tribut­ing to the hy­dro­log­i­cal cy­cle. Fur­ther­more, trees can be used to im­prove the qual­ity of hu­man life by soak­ing up pol­lu­tion and dust from the air, re­build nat­u­ral habi­tats and ecosys­tems, mit­i­gate global warm­ing since forests fa­cil­i­tate bio se­ques­tra­tion of at­mo­spheric car­bon diox­ide, and harvest for tim­ber. How­ever, here in Zim­babwe, we are los­ing forests at an in­cred­i­bly higher rate with spo­radic and unco-or­di­nated ef­forts to re­for­est. Each year more than 13 mil­lion hectares of forests are lost in the whole world. Recog­nis­ing the im­por­tance of forests and find­ing ways to de­crease de­for­esta­tion has been at the fore­front of cli­mate change ne­go­ti­a­tions for the last few years. Among ne­go­tia­tors, gov­ern­ment and ob­servers, it is clearly recog­nised that to com­bat cli­mate change, re­for­esta­tion should be se­ri­ously con­sid­ered. Zim­babwe has about 54% (21 mil­lion ha) pro­por­tion of land cov­ered by for­est with an es­ti­mated rate of de­for­esta­tion of 1,5% per year. Over the years, Zim­babwe has wit­nessed a re­duc­tion in the quan­tity and qual­ity of its nat­u­ral re­sources, mainly as a re­sult of un­con­trolled de­for­esta­tion due to er­ratic power sup­ply and lack of al­ter­na­tive and clean en­ergy sources. The ma­jor­ity of peo­ple in Zim­babwe both in the ru­ral and ur­ban ar­eas live off nat­u­ral re­sources for farm­ing and en­ergy and this has led to in­creas­ing de­for­esta­tion and land degra­da­tion across the coun­try. The quest for sur­vival has given birth to ram­pant cut­ting down of trees im­pact­ing neg­a­tively on the en­vi­ron­ment. We have wit­nessed mas­sive sil­ta­tion of mi­nor and ma­jor rivers alike across the whole coun­try as a re­sult of soil ero­sion caused by the loss of tree cover, the end re­sult be­ing that of a de­cline in agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. Zim­babwe has reg­is­tered a de­cline in maize crop pro­duc­tion for the past decade and ac­cord­ing to Fews­net, 38% of the pop­u­la­tion is food poor and need­ing food as­sis­tance be­gin­ning of 2020. The de­crease is mainly at­trib­uted to the late on­set of rains, the er­ratic rain­fall pat­tern and oc­cur­rence of pro­longed dry spells dur­ing plant­ing sea­sons, ev­i­dence of the global cli­matic changes. The Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Plan ( TSP) ac­knowl­edges that agri­cul­ture, be­ing the back­bone of our econ­omy un­der­pin­ning eco­nomic growth, food se­cu­rity and poverty erad­i­ca­tion con­tin­ues to ex­pe­ri­ence sys­tem­atic chal­lenges ex­ac­er­bated by pro­longed pe­ri­ods of drought caused by cli­mate change. SDG Goal 15 talks about the pro­tec­tion, restora­tion and pro­mo­tion of sus­tain­able use of ter­res­trial ecosys­tems, sus­tain­ably man­age forests, com­bat de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion, and halt and re­verse land degra­da­tion and halt bio­di­ver­sity loss. Ac­cord­ingly, there is need to in­te­grate the prin­ci­ples of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment into coun­try poli­cies and pro­grammes to re­verse the loss of en­vi­ron­men­tal re­sources. Re­for­esta­tion, which is the nat­u­ral or cal­cu­lated re­stock­ing of ex­ist­ing forests and wood­lands that have been de­pleted, usu­ally through de­for­esta­tion is one such initiative to­wards at­tain­ing the above-men­tioned goal. This is a call on the part of gov­ern­ment to ur­gently ad­dress re­for­esta­tion in an en­deav­our to come up with strate­gies to re­store food se­cu­rity in the coun­try. The gov­ern­ment, through the En­vi­ron­ment, Wa­ter and Cli­mate min­istry in con­junc­tion with the Forestry Com­mis­sion, En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment Agency, lo­cal au­thor­i­ties with sup­port from de­vel­op­ment part­ners and civil so­ci­ety should come up with an ag­gres­sive and com­pul­sory na­tional re­for­esta­tion plan. The plan should set out the aims, over­all lay­out, pri­or­i­ties for re­for­esta­tion ef­forts in the coun­try. Re­for­esta­tion projects are not just about re­gen­er­at­ing forests, other el­e­ments like liveli­hood gen­er­a­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, bet­ter agri­cul­tural prac­tices, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, pro­mo­tion of FDI, restora­tion of bio­di­ver­sity and catch­ment pro­tec­tion will be in­te­grated in or­der to har­ness full ben­e­fits from the project. As gov­ern­ment is cur­rently seized with work on the na­tional de­vel­op­ment strat­egy, it is crit­i­cal that cli­mate change is­sues be main­streamed into the plan as this will im­pact agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity and ul­ti­mately the GDP of the econ­omy thereby caus­ing in­clu­sive growth and de­vel­op­ment of the na­tion. There is need to lever­age on the tech­ni­cal and fi­nan­cial sup­port from de­vel­op­ment part­ners for a re­sound­ing suc­cess in the initiative. IMF man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva, at the vir­tual launch of the Global Cen­tre on Adap­ta­tion Africa held in Septem­ber 2020 said: “More than any other re­gion, Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa is vul­ner­a­ble to the im­pact of cli­mate change, which threat­ens lives and liveli­hoods and un­der­mines eco­nomic growth and after the cur­rent COVID-19 cri­sis, boost­ing re­silience is an ur­gent pri­or­ity so it is vi­tal we share the knowl­edge and best prac­tice that can help ac­cel­er­ate cli­mate adap­ta­tion.” • Read full ar­ti­cle on www.newsday.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161229,China’s Africa pol­icy ad­dresses poverty,"China has since proved that it is de­voted to the all­round de­vel­op­ment of friendly re­la­tions with Africa. CHINA’S pol­icy to­wards Africa has the po­ten­tial to lift the con­ti­nent out of poverty if all its con­tents are im­ple­mented ac­cord­ingly. In the last nine years, the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant re­leased two po­si­tion pa­pers on its pol­icy on Africa, which act as guide­lines to its deal­ings with the con­ti­nent. The un­der­ly­ing in­put of the poli­cies is that African coun­tries are sovereign states with their own cho­sen paths to de­vel­op­ment. China makes it clear that it will not in­ter­fere with the in­ter­nal af­fairs of any African coun­try, but will as­sist them to de­velop and be­come mod­ern so­ci­eties. The China’s pri­or­i­ties in Africa are the con­ti­nent’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and help­ing it to mod­ernise its agri­cul­ture. The ba­sis be­ing that with­out in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, African so­ci­eties will re­main back­yard economies and not much progress will be made in the up­lift­ing of the stan­dards of liv­ing. Agri­cul­ture re­mains the main­stay of most African economies and its mech­a­ni­sa­tion will go a long way in ad­dress­ing food in­se­cu­rity and at­tract­ing the much-needed for­eign cur­rency through food ex­ports. China’s sec­ond African pol­icy was re­leased by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in South Africa last year, dur­ing the Sec­ond Sum­mit of the Forum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion. The first pa­per, which set a new era in China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion was re­leased in 2006. What is im­por­tant at the mo­ment is that pro­vi­sions of these pol­icy pa­pers be car­ried out fully and ef­fec­tively, since they play an im­por­tant guid­ing role in all-round de­vel­op­ment of China-Africa re­la­tions. But this re­quires African coun­tries to play their part, es­pe­cially af­ter China has al­ready shown its will­ing­ness to as­sist the con­ti­nent in its de­vel­op­ment. The African coun­tries should pro­pose vi­able projects for fund­ing by Chi­nese in­sti­tu­tions, con­sid­er­ing that most of the projects are now be­ing funded by the pri­vate sec­tor. Chi­nese fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions such as the China Ex­port and Im­port Bank, China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund and the newly formed Asian In­fras­truc­ture In­vest­ment Bank are now at the fore­front of pro­vid­ing fund­ing for projects in Africa. Chi­nese multi-bil­lion Sta­te­owned en­ter­prises and pri­vate com­pa­nies are also in­creas­ingly get­ting in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing in Africa. These have been re­spon­si­ble for the huge in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment that has been tak­ing place in many African coun­tries. But all ef­forts from the Chi­nese govern­ment and African firms are guided by the Asian coun­try’s Africa pol­icy doc­u­ments. This is be­cause the pol­icy demon­strates China’s de­ter­mi­na­tion and good­will to de­velop friendly and co­op­er­a­tive re­la­tions with African coun­tries. Ac­cord­ing to the pol­icy, China be­lieves it has a com­mon and shared fu­ture with the African con­ti­nent, with the re­la­tion­ship dat­ing back many cen­turies ago. The re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two is anchored on sin­cer­ity, friendship and equal­ity. And this ex­plains why China and Africa have com­mit­ted them­selves to mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion and com­mon de­vel­op­ment. In deal­ing with Africa, the buzz words for China are strate­gic part­ner­ship, po­lit­i­cal equal­ity, mu­tual trust, eco­nomic win-win co­op­er­a­tion and cul­tural ex­change. It is eco­nomic win-win co­op­er­a­tion that is fast prov­ing to be the main­stay of this re­la­tion­ship, as it is bring­ing real de­vel­op­ment that had eluded African coun­tries for so long. Since 2009, for ex­am­ple, China has been Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, and trade vol­umes rose four times that of 2006. In the same vein, China’s con­tri­bu­tion to Africa’s eco­nomic growth has sig­nif­i­cantly in­creased. In the pol­icy, China will pri­ori­tise sup­port for Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, which has be­come a key area of fo­cus in the friendly re­la­tions. The pol­icy states that al­low­ing in­dus­trial align­ment and ca­pac­ity co­opera- tion to play a lead­ing role in bring­ing about over­all de­vel­op­ment will help ac­cel­er­ate the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of Africa. This will pro­vide a solid foun­da­tion for Africa’s eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence as well as self-re­liant and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. This in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process will be heav­ily sup­ported by the de­vel­op­ment of spe­cial eco­nomic zones, in­dus­trial parks and sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy parks to at­tract in­vest­ment and tal­ent. “China will give pri­or­ity to build­ing pilot in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion demon­stra­tion zones in African coun­tries with ap­pro­pri­ate con­di­tions,” states the pol­icy. An­other im­por­tant area of China’s pol­icy on Africa is agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion. It is hoped that a vi­brant agri­cul­tural sys­tem will have an in­creased out­put and help ex­pand the in­dus­trial base of African coun­tries. In this re­gard, China says it is will­ing to share its ex­pe­ri­ence and tech­nol­ogy in agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment with African coun­tries. The Asian coun­try sup­ports ef­forts by African coun­tries to im­prove their agri­cul­tural tech­nol­ogy and tech­niques to pro­duce and process agri­cul­tural, live­stock and fish­ery prod­ucts. Prac­ti­cal ac­tion in this re­gard in­clude the set­ting up of High-Qual­ity and High Yield Agri­cul­ture Demon­stra­tion Projects in African coun­tries. This has been com­pli­mented by peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, which now see al­most three mil­lion vis­its made be­tween China and Africa ev­ery year. China has since proved that it is de­voted to the all-round de­vel­op­ment of friendly re­la­tions with Africa. The prin­ci­ples of China’s Africa pol­icy are backed by sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith, up­hold­ing of val­ues and friendship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests. Sin­cer­ity Ac­cord­ing to the Chi­nese po­si­tion pa­per on Africa, sin­cer­ity means that “China in­sists on the prin­ci­ples of equal­ity, mu­tual trust, sol­i­dar­ity and mu­tual sup­port. This en­tails China re­spect­ing the choices of African coun­tries when it comes to de­vel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties. China says it is ready to ex­change gov­er­nance ex­pe­ri­ence with African coun­tries “on the ba­sis of equal­ity and vol­un­tarism, and pro­mote mu­tual un­der­stand­ing and ac­cep­tance of and learn­ing from each other’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem and de­vel­op­ment path”. Prac­ti­cal re­sults The pol­icy states that it ad­heres to hon­our­ing com­mit­ments with real ac­tions and re­sults. China em­ploys its tra­di­tional phi­los­o­phy of “build­ing a nest to at­tract the phoenix and teach­ing peo­ple how to fish”. In this en­deav­our, the pol­icy states that China will sup­port African coun­tries’ ef­forts in in­fras­truc­ture and hu­man re­sources de­vel­op­ment. This will help the African coun­tries overcome the above con­straints that have been the ma­jor stum­bling blocks in Africa’s de­vel­op­ment. Affin­ity China’s Africa pol­icy states that the Chi­nese and African peo­ple should live to­gether in har­mony, and “pro­mote in­ter-cul­tural di­a­logue and en­hance ex­changes of ideas, pol­icy align­ment and mu­tual un­der­stand­ing”. This is meant to pro­vide a solid and pop­u­lar ba­sis for China-Africa friendship. China says in its pol­icy on Africa that it will give “full play to fi­nanc­ing plat­forms and tools, which in­clude pref­er­en­tial loans and other means of pol­icy-based fi­nance, the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund, spe­cial loans for African small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.” There are also the Africa Grow­ing To­gether Fund, China-Africa in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion fund, and the BRICS’ New De­vel­op­ment Bank to of­fer fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to African coun­tries. The pol­icy states that China will en­cour­age more African com­modi­ties to en­ter its mar­ket and con­tinue to grant zero-tar­iff treat­ment to 97 per­cent of tax­able items from the least de­vel­oped coun­tries. China says it will strengthen qual­ity con­trol of the goods ex­ported to Africa and build more sales chan­nels, re­in­force co­op­er­a­tion in in­spec­tion and quar­an­tine with African coun­tries, and jointly crack down on coun­ter­feit or sub­stan­dard im­port and ex­port goods. As the largest devel­op­ing coun­try, China has al­ready pro­vided as­sis­tance to African coun­tries for a long time and will con­tinue to do so within its ca­pa­bil­ity, notes the pol­icy. China’s pol­icy on Africa touches on many other ar­eas which are meant to up­lift re­la­tions be­tween the two sides. But it takes po­lit­i­cal will from both sides for the pro­vi­sions of the pol­icy, which is sup­ported by the 10-Point Plan as enun­ci­ated by Pres­i­dent Xi in South Africa last year, for the pol­icy to be suc­cess­fully im­ple­mented.",津巴布韦

The rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the EPA fol­lows the with­drawal of the UK from the Euro­pean Union, mean­ing it can no longer trade un­der the Eastern and South­ern Africa-EU EPA. Last year, South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Eswa­tini, Le­sotho and Mozam­bique signed the same EPA UK trade deal. Writ­ing on his Twit­ter han­dle, @ Min­is­terSBMoyo, For­eign Af­fairs and In­ter­na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter, Dr Sibu­siso Moyo said the rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the deal was a big step in the coun­try’s re-en­gage­ment ef­forts. “This is a huge step for Zim­babwe’s re-en­gage­ment ef­forts. The sign­ing of this part­ner­ship will un­doubt­edly bring in­creased trade and in­vest­ment to Zim­babwe,” said Min­is­ter Moyo. UK Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Ms Melanie Robin­son wel­comed Zim­babwe’s de­ci­sion to rat­ify the EPA. “Glad Zim­babwe has rat­i­fied the Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship Agree­ment with the UK. This en­sures that ex­porters con­tinue to en­joy tar­iff and quota free ac­cess to the UK mar­ket. “The UK sup­ports Zim­bab­wean busi­nesses and jobs for eco­nomic devel­op­ment,” she wrote on her twit­ter han­dle. Bri­tain voted to leave the EU fol­low­ing a ref­er­en­dum held in June 2016 and has since been ne­go­ti­at­ing sep­a­rate trade deals. EPAs are devel­op­ment- fo­cused trade agree­ments that aim to pro­mote in­creased trade and in­vest­ment. They con­trib­ute to sus­tain­able growth and poverty re­duc­tion in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Gov­ern­ment’s re- en­gage­ment ef­forts have been premised on eco­nomic diplo­macy and has been on a drive to boost ties with var­i­ous coun­tries across the world. Some of the deals that have born fruit in­clude the thrash­ing of an agree­ment with US com­pany John Deere for the sup­ply of trac­tors and other agri­cul­tural equip­ment. In a sim­i­lar deal, the coun­try has also taken de­liv­ery of trac­tors and other farm­ing im­ple­ments from Be­larus, while top US firm Gen­eral Elec­tric, to­gether with Power Con­struc­tion of China, have been se­lected to build a US$ 4 bil­lion hy­dropower project strad­dling the Zim­bab­wean and Zam­bia bor­ders.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201103,Fast-grow­ing China per­fect tem­plate to achieve Vi­sion 2030,"VI­SION 2030 is an eco­nomic growth out­look be­ing pur­sued by Gov­ern­ment, the key goal is for the coun­try to have an up­per-mid­dle in­come econ­omy by the said year. An up­per mid­dle in­come coun­try is de­scribed by the World Bank as a coun­try whose cit­i­zens make be­tween US$4 125, but not more than US$12 736 read­ing what is known as Gross Na­tional In­come per capita. It is un­der this clus­ter that you find coun­tries like China, Jor­dan, Iran and Belarus. Done right, this means thou­sands, if not mil­lions, are go­ing to be el­e­vated from poverty to a life of fair com­fort. The good thing is Zim­babwe, will not be shoot­ing in the dark, there is a prece­dent to be fol­lowed plus there is po­lit­i­cal will. One of the coun­tries it en­joys good re­la­tions with, man­aged to suc­cess­fully im­ple­ment one of the most iconic eco­nomic as­cen­sions the mod­ern world has seen. China has just over­taken the United States to be­come the world’s largest econ­omy. Per­haps, now is the best time to put our al­liance to good use and learn from them what they did right. There is need to fol­low the trail to see how they man­aged to turn around their econ­omy for the bet­ter of their peo­ple. Some of the pol­icy di­rec­tions taken by Gov­ern­ment show that we are on the right path. Fight Against Cor­rup­tion Ever since get­ting into of­fice, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has de­clared war against abuse of of­fice and mis­ap­pro­pri­a­tion of pub­lic funds. Cor­rup­tion has been bleed­ing the coun­try of re­sources which are sup­posed to be di­rected to­wards in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment projects. Be­fore Op­er­a­tion Re­store Legacy and the sub­se­quent ush­er­ing of the Sec­ond Re­pub­lic, graft had be­come en­demic to the ex­tent that even traf­fic po­lice of­fi­cers were mount­ing road­blocks purely for fundrais­ing pur­poses with very lit­tle in­ter­est in road safety. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa enun­ci­ated a war on cor­rup­tion, which has seen a num­ber of high-rank­ing mem­bers of so­ci­ety and pub­lic of­fice hold­ers be­ing ar­rested. Two Cab­i­net min­is­ters, lost their jobs af­ter be­ing im­pli­cated in cor­rup­tion cases. While many have cases which are still go­ing through due pro­cesses of law, some have al­ready been con­victed of fi­nan­cial im­pru­dence while in pub­lic of­fice. This in­cludes for­mer di­rec­tor of State Res­i­dences Dou­glas Tap­fu­maneyi who was sen­tenced to four years in pri­son for crim­i­nal abuse of of­fice. For­mer En­ergy Min­is­ter Sa­muel Un­denge was also slapped with a twoand-a-half year sen­tence af­ter fi­nan­cial dis­hon­esty when he held pub­lic of­fice. The con­vic­tions and the re­con­sti­tu­tion of the Zim­babwe Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion shows that Zim­babwe is tak­ing elab­o­rate steps to ar­rest cor­rup­tion. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa promised to en­sure that the fight against cor­rup­tion re­mains well funded and on track. Ad­dress­ing the 345th Polit­buro ses­sion in Harare, this week, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa warned peo­ple in his party ZANU PF against cor­rup­tion say­ing the law will not re­spect af­fil­i­a­tion. “I thus ex­hort party cadres and the citizenry at all lev­els in line with our na­tional de­vel­op­ment agenda to be guar­an­tors of a cor­rupt free Zim­babwe. Re­port all cases of cor­rup­tion to the Zim­babwe Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion and the Zim­babwe Re­pub­lic Po­lice,” he said. In the fight against cor­rup­tion, the most com­pli­cated el­e­ments are those who try and cush­ion them­selves us­ing in­sti­tu­tions, es­pe­cially po­lit­i­cal par­ties which con­trol the levers of power and Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa was right to blow that cover. Pre­sent­ing the Min­istry of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment’s PreBud­get Pa­per re­cently, Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube said there will be more bud­getary sup­port to ZACC and other in­sti­tu­tions that fight graft in Zim­babwe. Di­rect­ing fi­nan­cial re­sources to a pol­icy po­si­tion is the best form of po­lit­i­cal will. This is sim­i­lar to what China has done over the years in its fight against cor­rup­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in his book, The Gover­nance of China Vol­ume 3 speaks on the im­por­tance for peo­ple in his Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party to ab­stain from graft un­der all cir­cum­stances. “We must de­velop a pos­i­tive and healthy po­lit­i­cal cul­ture in the Party and im­prove the Party’s po­lit­i­cal ecosys­tem, res­o­lutely cor­rect mis­con­duct in all its forms, and show zero tol­er­ance for cor­rup­tion,” Pres­i­dent Xi wrote to his fel­low CPC mem­bers. In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment An eco­nomic re­cov­ery strat­egy which does not give prece­dence to the de­vel­op­ment of in­fra­struc­ture is at best rhetoric po­etry. Good roads, dams, bridges, well-func­tion­ing fac­to­ries are part of what many mar­vel at when they look at the so-called de­vel­oped coun­tries. Aca­demics Kobus Jonker and Bryan Robin­son in a chap­ter in their book China’s Im­pact on the African Re­nais­sance ar­gue that in­fra­struc­ture is the most im­por­tant en­abler of or­ganic growth in Africa. For­tu­nately, for Zim­babwe, the pre­vi­ously ne­glected in­fra­struc­ture ques­tion which was in the past rel­e­gated is fi­nally be­ing an­swered. The new dis­pen­sa­tion has placed pri­or­ity on in­fra­struc­ture. Across the coun­try, there have been ef­forts to in­sti­tute road im­prove­ments, dam re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and a gen­eral im­prove­ment of in­fra­struc­ture. Trans­port and In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter, Joel Big­gie Ma­tiza listed the Harare-Beit­bridge road as the up­per­most pri­or­ity for the Gov­ern­ment. “This in­volves re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, con­struc­tion and widen­ing of the road to 12,5 me­tres in line with the SADC Trans­port and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Com­mis­sion stan­dard from the cur­rent seven me­tres,” Min­is­ter Ma­tiza said. The im­prove­ment of the busiest high­way in the SADC re­gion stands as a state­ment of in­tent on how far the coun­try is will­ing to go in en­sur­ing that there is en­abling in­fra­struc­ture. Zim­babwe, should con­sider align­ing it­self with the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive which is China’s global in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment strat­egy, which has been in ef­fect for the past seven years. Ex­plain­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive idea, Pres­i­dent Xi said: “The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive is de­signed for eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, not for geopo­lit­i­cal or mil­i­tary al­liance. It is an open and in­clu­sive process which does not ex­clude any party. “It is not de­signed to form an ex­clu­sive bloc or a `China club’ its par­tic­i­pa­tion is not based on ide­ol­ogy and it is cer­tainly not a zero-sum game. Any coun­try that wants to par­tic­i­pate in this ini­tia­tive is free to do so.” Zim­babwe may want to make the best of its good re­la­tion with the Asian gi­ants which will feed into the coun­try’s na­tional de­vel­op­ment strat­egy for 2030. De­cen­tral­i­sa­tion One of the ma­jor is­sues af­fect­ing Zim­babwe was the cen­tral­i­sa­tion of sys­tems to the cap­i­tal, Harare. This cre­ated bot­tle­necks as ev­ery­thing needed one over­ar­ch­ing sig­na­ture to make things move. Zim­babwe is seek­ing to cre­ate a new way of op­er­at­ing, by im­ple­ment­ing de­vo­lu­tion, a con­sti­tu­tional pro­vi­sion call­ing for the de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion of pro­cesses. Zim­babwe re­cently took a bold step to ap­point pro­vin­cial co­or­di­na­tors who will lead the process of ush­er­ing in de­vo­lu­tion. The pro­vin­cial co­or­di­na­tors will be as­sist­ing Min­is­ters of State for Pro­vin­cial Af­fairs with “tech­ni­cal and ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port” needed to pro­mote eco­nomic growth, cre­ate jobs and up­lift peo­ple’s liv­ing stan­dards. In­ter­linked with spe­cial eco­nomic zones, in which ge­o­graph­i­cal ar­eas play to their ad­van­tage, de­vo­lu­tion can be a way to stim­u­late growth in pre­vi­ously ne­glected ar­eas. This dove­tails into how China en­sured the birth of new cities and pro­duc­tive re­gions. Out­lin­ing the guide­lines for co­or­di­nated re­gional de­vel­op­ment Pres­i­dent Xi said there is need to “give full play to the com­par­a­tive strengths of dif­fer­ent re­gions, and pro­mote ra­tio­nal flow and con­cen­tra­tion of re­sources.” Zim­babwe`s Vi­sion 2030 may look like a lofty pro­jec­tion but in essence it is a work­able plan that may ma­te­ri­alise if there is po­lit­i­cal will to im­ple­ment. China has al­ready shown how it is done and there is no need to rein­vent the wheel. We can learn from what they have achieved, im­prove on it and crys­talise our path to glory. Our good re­la­tions with them can al­low a smooth ex­change of notes and per­spec­tives. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210115,De­mo­li­tions: A case of stolen hu­man dig­nity,"ZIM­BABWE has a long but sad his­tory of de­mol­ish­ing houses des­ig­nated as il­le­gal with the hall­mark being the May 2005 gov­ern­men­tled Op­er­a­tion Mu­ram­bat­sv­ina/Re­store Or­der. The bru­tal ex­er­cise di­rectly af­fected 700 000 peo­ple and 2,4 mil­lion oth­ers in­di­rectly, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions (UN). The ur­ban clean-up ex­er­cise had far­reach­ing con­se­quences on the pop­u­lace with the UN con­demn­ing the act as a “dis­as­trous ven­ture” and in vi­o­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional law. Post-2005, the ur­ban hous­ing de­mo­li­tions have be­come a con­tin­uum rather than episodic. Sev­eral in­hu­mane ex­pe­ri­ences of homes razed to the ground have been wit­nessed mainly in Harare and Chi­tung­wiza for the past 15 years as des­per­ate home-seek­ers stand ac­cused of build­ing on il­le­gal land. The rea­sons for these il­le­gal set­tle­ments vary. Some fam­i­lies were duped by land barons bent on lin­ing their pock­ets while oth­ers ben­e­fit­ted from du­bi­ous al­lo­ca­tions by am­bi­tious politi­cians aim­ing to build a power­base. The lat­est de­mo­li­tion episode in­volves Chi­tung­wiza Mu­nic­i­pal­ity which is plan­ning to de­stroy 11 000 prop­er­ties built on wet­lands, rail­way servi­tudes, power wayleaves and sewer lines. A court or­der is still to be ob­tained to carry out the de­mo­li­tions. But ques­tions abound as to who should shoul­der the blame for the peren­nial prob­lem. Politi­cians have on many in­stances shame­fully hi­jacked cri­sis mo­ments to score points as Zanu PF and the MDC-Al­liance trade ac­cu­sa­tions and counter-ac­cu­sa­tions. With the mori­bund econ­omy as a re­sult of nearly 40-years of mis­rule by the late for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe, fam­i­lies are forced to se­cure al­ter­na­tive ac­com­mo­da­tion to es­cape as­tro­nom­i­cal rentals. Not­with­stand­ing a de­pressed econ­omy and un­prece­dented high lev­els of cor­rup­tion, res­i­dents have to play their part; ad­here to city by-laws and do due dili­gence on land sale trans­ac­tions to save their hard earned money. The hous­ing back­log re­mains high at about 1,5 mil­lion with Harare alone con­tribut­ing half a mil­lion. There is no quick so­lu­tion in sight de­spite sev­eral pa­per tigers such as the Own-Your-Home Scheme un­der the 2013-2018 ZimAs­set, which set an am­bi­tious tar­get of ser­vic­ing and pro­vid­ing 300 00 stands for res­i­den­tial house con­struc­tion. The stands re­main a pie in the sky. Cabi­net, in Novem­ber 2020, ap­proved a Zim­babwe Na­tional Hu­man Set­tle­ments Pol­icy with a chief ob­jec­tive to ease the hous­ing and so­cial ameni­ties back­log in line with Vi­sion 2030 and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. But with the high num­ber of blue­prints, Zim­babwe’s econ­omy could be among the BRICS (Brazil, Rus­sia, India, China and South Africa) but lack of im­ple­men­ta­tion has sig­nif­i­cantly stalled progress. Thus, ad­dress­ing the acute hous­ing short­age in ur­ban ar­eas and at­ten­dant poverty stalk­ing the ru­ral folk re­quires more action than rhetoric. Both cen­tral gov­ern­ment and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have to put hands on deck to pull the pop­u­lace out of the eco­nomic dol­drums that have birthed sprawl­ing il­le­gal set­tle­ments.",津巴布韦

The state­ment was in re­sponse to Nor­ton leg­is­la­tor Temba Mliswa’s sug­ges­tion that the co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Harare and Bei­jing was not ben­e­fi­cial to the lat­ter in light of its eco­nomic chal­lenges.

He added that China has ex­tended a US$58 mil­lion to Zim­babwe to com­plete post cy­clone re-con­struc­tion and other projects. “A few days ago, China de­cided to pro­vide an­other new batch of grant of 400 mil­lion RMB (US$58 mil­lion) to Zim­babwe to help the coun­try com­plete post-cy­clone re­con­struc­tion and other im­por­tant projects. “It is not only log­i­cally ab­surd, but also morally un­ten­able to sim­ply blame that Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic dif­fi­cul­ties can be at­trib­uted to China’s in­vest­ment not be­ing good for Zim­babwe. It is uni­ver­sally recog­nised that whether a coun­try can get rid of poverty and achieve sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment mainly re­lies on its own ef­forts,” he said. Re­spond­ing to some ac­cu­sa­tion by Mliswa that dur­ing the con­struc­tion of the new Par­lia­ment build­ing, min­eral ex­trac­tion is the or­der of the day, the Am­bas­sador said the par­lia­ment pro­ject in is fi­nanced by the grant from the Chi­nese Gov­ern­ment. “The New Par­lia­ment Pro­ject is a pro­ject fi­nanced by the grant from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. It does not have any at­tached pro­ject, nor does it spend a sin­gle penny from the Zim­bab­wean gov­ern­ment’s cof­fer. “This pro­ject is a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the pro­found friend­ship be­tween the two gov­ern­ments and the peoples of China and Zim­babwe and brooks no one’s smear or dis­tort­ing,” he said. He added that the two coun­tries en­joy a pro­found tra­di­tional friend­ship. “China-Zim­babwe re­la­tions will not be af­fected by slan­der or vil­i­fy­ing by any in­di­vid­ual. The Chi­nese em­bassy in Zim­babwe is firmly op­posed to the move by cer­tain in­di­vid­ual or me­dia to un­der­mine the friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries through fling­ing abuses, fab­ri­cat­ing ru­mours and ma­li­cious slan­der. “This does no good to Zim­babwe’s own de­vel­op­ment. We sin­cerely hope that the Zim­bab­wean side will con­tinue to cre­ate a more favourable en­vi­ron­ment for all for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, in­clud­ing Chi­nese en­ter­prises,” he added. The two coun­tries have al­ways ren­dered each other strong sup­port on is­sues con­cern­ing each other’s core in­ter­ests. On the tile plant Am­bas­sador Guo said the Chi­nese em­bassy at­taches im­por­tance to Mr Mliswa’s crit­i­cisms and pro­pos­als con­cern­ing the tiles fac­tory and has since co­or­di­nated the two sides to solve the prob­lem through di­a­logue and con­sul­ta­tion on sev­eral oc­ca­sions. “With the fa­cil­i­ta­tion of the Chi­nese em­bassy, the di­a­logue be­tween the two sides is still go­ing on and we ex­pect it to pro­duce pos­i­tive re­sults. If the rel­e­vant is­sues can­not be re­solved through con­sul­ta­tion, the two sides may settle them ra­tio­nally through le­gal chan­nels,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150510,Smart goals: Pre­ven­tion the way to go,"By Septem­ber, the world’s 193 gov­ern­ments will meet in New york and agree on a set of am­bi­tious, global tar­gets for 2030. Over the next 15 years th­ese tar­gets will di­rect the $2,5 tril­lion to be spent on devel­op­ment as­sis­tance, as well as count­less tril­lions in na­tional bud­gets. Based on peer-re­viewed analy­ses from 82 of the world’s top econ­o­mists and 44 sec­tor ex­perts or­gan­ised by the Copen­hagen Con­sen­sus, three of us — Finn, Tom and Nancy — have pri­ori­tised more than a hun­dred of the pro­posed tar­gets in terms of their value-for-money. They are cer­tainly not all equal. Some tar­gets gen­er­ate much higher eco­nomic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal benefits than oth­ers, per dollar spent. The nat­u­ral po­lit­i­cal in­cli­na­tion is to prom­ise all good things to ev­ery­one, and the UN is cur­rently poised to pick 169 well-in­ten­tioned tar­gets. But the ev­i­dence at hand, although limited, in­di­cates pretty clearly that some of th­ese tar­gets are much more promis­ing than oth­ers. The analy­ses of the ex­perts sug­gest that some of the tar­gets are barely worth­while, pro­duc­ing only a lit­tle more than $1 in so­cial benefits per dollar spent, while oth­ers pro­duce much higher so­cial re­turns. We have se­lected the 19 tar­gets that we ex­pect to pro­duce the great­est benefits. The ex­pert analy­ses sug­gest that if the UN con­cen­trates on th­ese top 19 tar­gets, it can get $20 to $40 in so­cial benefits per dollar spent, while al­lo­cat­ing it evenly across all 169 tar­gets would re­duce the fig­ure to less than $10. Be­ing smart about spend­ing could be bet­ter than dou­bling or qua­dru­pling the aid bud­get. Our short list cov­ers a lot of ground, but the thread that con­nects the in­di­vid­ual tar­gets is the benefits they will pro­vide for peo­ple around the world in terms of health, the en­vi­ron­ment, and eco­nomic well-be­ing, the three head­ings the UN has dubbed “peo­ple, planet and pros­per­ity”. Con­sider a cou­ple of tar­gets that help peo­ple di­rectly through health benefits. Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (TB) is a “hid­den” dis­ease. Over two bil­lion peo­ple carry the bac­terium that causes it, about 10% of those peo­ple will de­velop TB at some point, and about 1,5 mil­lion peo­ple each year die from TB. But treat­ment is in­ex­pen­sive and, in most cases, highly ef­fec­tive. Spend­ing a dollar on di­ag­no­sis and treat­ment is a low-cost way to give many more years of pro­duc­tive life to many peo­ple. Ebola may get the head­lines, but TB is a much big­ger prob­lem. Re­duc­ing child­hood mal­nu­tri­tion is an­other ex­cel­lent tar­get. Peo­ple of ev­ery age de­serve to be well-nour­ished, but nu­tri­tion is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal for young chil­dren. A good diet al­lows their brains and mus­cles to de­velop bet­ter, pro­duc­ing life-long benefits. Well-nour­ished chil­dren stay in school longer, learn more and end up be­ing much more pro­duc­tive mem­bers of so­ci­ety. The avail­able ev­i­dence sug­gests that pro­vid­ing bet­ter nu­tri­tion for 68 mil­lion chil­dren each year would pro­duce over $40 in long-term so­cial benefits for ev­ery dollar spent. There are ex­cel­lent tar­gets in­volv­ing the planet as well. Gov­ern­ments around the world still sub­sidise the use of fos­sil fu­els to the tune of over $500 bn each year. Cut­ting th­ese sub­si­dies would re­duce pol­lu­tion and free up re­sources for in­vest­ments in health, ed­u­ca­tion, and in­fra­struc­ture. Pro­tect­ing coral reefs turns out to be a sur­pris­ingly ef­fi­cient tar­get as well. There are benefits in terms of bio­di­ver­sity, but healthy reefs also pro­duce more tan­gi­ble and im­me­di­ate benefits. They in­crease fish stocks — ben­e­fit­ting both fish­er­men and con­sumers, and at­tract vis­i­tors who ex­plore their beau­ties — ben­e­fit­ting ev­ery­one work­ing in the tourist in­dus­try, as well as the tourists them­selves. Per­haps the most im­por­tant, over-arch­ing prob­lem fac­ing the world is poverty, which still af­flicts bil­lions of peo­ple. Poverty is the ul­ti­mate source of many other prob­lems. Poor fam­i­lies have trou­ble pro­vid­ing their chil­dren with ad­e­quate food, ed­u­ca­tion, and med­i­cal care. The im­me­di­ate re­sult is high rates of in­fant mor­tal­ity, as well as poor cog­ni­tive skills and re­duced pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity among sur­viv­ing chil­dren. The ul­ti­mate re­sult is a cy­cle of poverty. Bet­ter nu­tri­tion and bet­ter schools will help al­le­vi­ate poverty, but there is an­other tar­get that prom­ises to be even more ef­fec­tive: low­er­ing bar­ri­ers to in­ter­na­tional trade. The his­tor­i­cal ev­i­dence on this point is com­pelling. In China, South Korea, In­dia, Chile and many other coun­tries, re­duc­ing trade re­stric­tions has lifted in­comes and re­duced poverty, and trig­gered decades of rapid in­come growth. Poverty re­duc­tion was the first item in UN’S list of Mil­len­nium Devel­op­ment Goals, and the nu­mer­i­cal tar­get was achieved. Why? In­come growth in China was a big part of the story. And how did the Chi­nese achieve that re­mark­able feat? Most ev­i­dence sug­gests that in­ter­na­tional trade was a key in­gre­di­ent. Trade pro­duces im­me­di­ate benefits by open­ing up mar­kets, but it also fa­cil­i­tates the flow of ideas and tech­nolo­gies, pro­duc­ing even greater benefits over a longer hori­zon. A suc­cess­ful Doha free trade agree­ment could lift 160 mil­lion peo­ple out of ex­treme poverty. Our list of tar­gets will not solve all the world’s prob­lems, but nei­ther can any list un­der re­al­is­tic bud­gets. Our list can help the UN make its choices like a savvy shop­per with limited funds. Choos­ing good tar­gets will vastly in­crease the benefits to peo­ple around the world, as well as gen­er­a­tions to come. Gov­ern­ments should forgo the in­stant grat­i­fi­ca­tion of promis­ing ev­ery­thing to ev­ery­one, and in­stead fo­cus on choos­ing smart devel­op­ment goals.

zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150111,Free trade makes you US$231 richer an­nu­ally,"With one sim­ple pol­icy — more free trade — we could make the world US$500 tril­lion bet­ter off and lift 160 mil­lion peo­ple out of ex­treme poverty. If there is one ques­tion we have to ask our­selves, it is: why don’t we? In 2000, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity agreed a set of im­por­tant tar­gets to im­prove the world’s poor­est by 2015, the Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals. Many of th­ese goals were ex­tremely suc­cess­ful in vi­tal ar­eas such as re­duc­ing poverty and hunger, but there is still much to be done. Through the UN, world lead­ers are now work­ing on the next set of tar­gets for 2015-2030. As the world will spend US$2,5 tril­lion just on de­vel­op­ment aid over that pe­riod, and count­less tril­lions in na­tional bud­gets, there are lots of con­tenders for th­ese tar­gets. That is why my think tank, Copen­hagen Con­sen­sus, has asked some 60 of the world’s top econ­o­mists to look at the eco­nomic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal costs and ben­e­fits of many dif­fer­ent tar­gets, in ar­eas like health, nu­tri­tion and ed­u­ca­tion. And th­ese are all im­por­tant. But one is­sue is of­ten miss­ing. As ar­gued in a new pa­per by pro­fes­sor Kym An­der­son of the Univer­sity of Ade­laide, re­duc­ing trade bar­ri­ers not only makes the world richer, it is a great en­abler for re­duc­ing poverty, cur­tail­ing hunger, im­prov­ing health, and restor­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. Freer trade es­sen­tially means that each coun­try can fo­cus on do­ing what it does best, mak­ing all coun­tries bet­ter off. Big strides have been made in lib­er­al­i­sa­tion since the Sec­ond World War, but the lat­est phase — the Doha De­vel­op­ment Agenda — seems stalled, with lit­tle hope of a res­o­lu­tion. This is dread­ful, par­tic­u­larly for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, be­cause two of the main ar­eas where agree­ment is elu­sive are agri­cul­ture and tex­tiles, both sec­tors where lower wage coun­tries in the trop­ics and sub-trop­ics have a com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage. A suc­cess­ful Doha round could get Africa bet­ter prices for agri­cul­tural pro­duce and tex­tile, which would make Africa richer. But more im­por­tantly, free trade could make Africa fo­cus on what it does best, which would boost growth just like it has hap­pened for China. Anal­y­sis shows that there would be sub­stan­tial re­wards for com­plet­ing the Doha round. The di­rect eco­nomic ben­e­fits would be a 1,1% in­crease in global GDP. This sounds mod­est. But be­cause it would im­pact the en­tire world econ­omy, by 2030 we would be about US$1,5 tril­lion richer ev­ery year. But open economies also grow faster. In the last 50 years, coun­tries as di­verse as South Korea, Chile and In­dia have seen their rate of growth shoot up by 1,5% per an­num on av­er­age, shortly after lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. If Doha can be com­pleted, it is es­ti­mated that the global econ­omy will grow by an ex­tra 0,6% for the next few decades. By 2030, such dy­namic growth would make the world econ­omy US$11,5 tril­lion larger each year, leav­ing us 10% more re­sources to fix all other prob­lems. And a large part of the ben­e­fit will go to the de­vel­op­ing world, which by 2030 would see its econ­omy US$7 tril­lion larger each year. On av­er­age, this in­creased GDP is equiv­a­lent to US$1 000 more for ev­ery per­son in the de­vel­op­ing world. Trans­lated di­rectly to Zim­babwe, this would mean the av­er­age per­son could be mak­ing an ex­tra US$231 per year. By the end of the cen­tury, free trade could leave our grand­kids 20% bet­ter off, or with US$100 tril­lion more ev­ery year than they would oth­er­wise have had. For now, pow­er­ful vested in­ter­ests make it hard for politi­cians to com­pro­mise. The jobs that are lost from free trade are ob­vi­ous and con­cen­trated — wit­ness Western farm­ers protest­ing los­ing their sub­si­dies. But the ben­e­fits are spread out — for ex­am­ple, food will be a bit cheaper for ev­ery­one and Third World farm­ers will see greater prof­its Yet we need to keep a sense of pro­por­tion. There are real costs from free trade in terms of work­ers need­ing re­train­ing and the pro­vi­sion of un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits. Th­ese out­lays will oc­cur mostly over the next decade and will cost US$100-US$300 bil­lion. But the ben­e­fits will ac­crue for at least the next nine decades, and to­tal US$500 tril­lion in present day dol­lars. For ev­ery dol­lar spent, we will achieve more than US$3 000 of ben­e­fits. And this will have huge im­pacts for the world’s poor. We know that eco­nomic growth has been one of the ma­jor driv­ers of poverty re­duc­tion — China’s rapid growth over the past 30 years has pulled 680 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, the most ever achieved in hu­man his­tory. Yet we still have about 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple liv­ing in ab­ject poverty to­day. With fu­ture growth, this num­ber will likely be re­duced to a still chok­ingly high 700 mil­lion by 2030. But if we achieve freer trade through the Doha round, the faster growth could lift an ex­tra 160 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty by 2030. It is worth step­ping back and re­al­is­ing this amaz­ing op­por­tu­nity for the world. Yes, we should help in ar­eas like food, ed­u­ca­tion, health, and the en­vi­ron­ment. But if we could just get it right on free trade, we could pos­si­bly do more good here than any­where else — leav­ing the world US$500 tril­lion bet­ter off, with 160 mil­lion fewer poor.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210224,Re­sources to pro­cure suf­fi­cient vac­cines in place,"CAB­I­NET re­ceived an up­date on the coun­try’s re­sponse to the Covid-19 out­break, which was pre­sented by the Min­is­ter of De­fence and War Vet­er­ans Af­fairs as the chair­per­son of the In­ter-Min­is­te­rial Task Force on the Covid-19 Out­break. Cab­i­net was in­formed that as at 19 Fe­bru­ary 2021, Zim­babwe’s cu­mu­la­tive Covid-19 cases had in­creased to 35 315, with 30 979 re­cov­er­ies, 1 414 deaths, a Case Fa­tal­ity Rate (CFR) of 4 per­cent, and a re­cov­ery rate of 88 per­cent. Thirty-three thou­sand six hun­dred and eighteen of the cases were at­trib­uted to lo­cal trans­mis­sion. Ac­tive cases now stand at 2 922, while the cu­mu­la­tive num­ber of in­fected Health Care Work­ers is 3 999, with 18 deaths. While the coun­try’s epi­demic curve is show­ing a gen­eral down­ward trend since mid-Jan­uary 2021, com­mu­ni­ties are urged not to be­come com­pla­cent and to con­tinue ob­serv­ing pre­cau­tion­ary Covid-19 mea­sures as pre­scribed by the Min­istry of Health and Child Care and the WHO guide­lines in or­der to main­tain the de­clin­ing trend. Se­cu­rity per­son­nel have there­fore been di­rected to in­ten­sify mon­i­tor­ing and en­force­ment in or­der to en­hance com­pli­ance. Re­gard­ing pri­mary and sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion, the re­spon­si­ble Min­istry con­tin­ues to work with the Min­istry of Health and Child Care to pre­pare for the in­evitable re-open­ing of schools. Mean­while, the train­ing of school health co­or­di­na­tors and the as­sess­ment of the schools’ prepa­ra­tions for the re­sump­tion of learn­ing is on­go­ing. Govern­ment is do­ing its best to en­sure that ad­e­quate pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures are taken be­fore schools are opened. PROGRESS RE­PORT ON THE PRO­CURE­MENT AND ROLL-OUT OF COVID19 VAC­CINES Cab­i­net re­ceived a progress re­port on the pro­cure­ment and roll-out of the Covid19 vac­cines, which was pre­sented by the Hon­ourable Vice Pres­i­dent Chi­wenga as Min­is­ter of Health and Child Care. Cab­i­net was in­formed that the Covid-19 roll-out pro­gramme was launched on Thurs­day Fe­bru­ary 17, 2021 at Wilkins In­fec­tious Dis­eases Hos­pi­tal. Vac­cine distri­bu­tion and train­ing of vac­ci­na­tors are un­der­way across the coun­try. Vac­ci­na­tion of tar­get groups com­menced on Fe­bru­ary 22, 2021 in all the prov­inces. Mea­sures have been put in place to guar­an­tee a steady flow of vac­cine doses, and to en­sure that tar­geted groups re­ceive their doses at the ap­pro­pri­ate time. The Republics of In­dia and the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion have do­nated Covid-19 vac­cines to the tune of 75 000 and 12 000 doses to Zim­babwe, re­spec­tively. The vac­cines come on the back­drop of an­other 200 000 doses do­nated by the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China. Mean­while, Govern­ment of Zim­babwe has put to­gether re­sources suf­fi­cient to pro­cure Covid-19 vac­cines to cover the herd im­mu­nity of 10 mil­lion peo­ple (60 per­cent). Cab­i­net has ap­proved the re­quest by the Min­istry of In­for­ma­tion, Pub­lic­ity and Broad­cast­ing Ser­vices to in­clude jour­nal­ists in Phase One of the in­oc­u­la­tion be­cause jour­nal­ism is listed as an es­sen­tial ser­vice in SI 93 of 2020 and the me­dia plays a cru­cial role in pro­vid­ing in­for­ma­tion that saves lives. Sim­i­larly, the Min­istry of Trans­port and In­fras­truc­tural De­vel­op­ment re­quested the Min­is­ter of Health and Child Care to des­ig­nate the Roads Sec­tor as an Es­sen­tial Ser­vice un­der the lock­down reg­u­la­tions. The main rea­sons for the re­quest in­clude, but are not lim­ited to the fol­low­ing: ◆ Roads cre­ate an en­abling environment in any econ­omy as they bridge the con­veyance gap be­tween sup­ply and de­mand; ◆ The im­por­tance of roads is fur­ther am­pli­fied in re­sponses to dis­as­ter sit­u­a­tions; and ◆ The cur­rent above-normal rains have brought se­vere dam­age to the na­tional road net­work, leav­ing com­mu­ni­ties cut off from as­sess­ing es­sen­tial ser­vices; and ◆ The Pres­i­dent has since de­clared roads in our towns and cities dys­func­tional and Govern­ment has com­mit­ted to take over roads in ur­ban ar­eas for re­pairs. THE INSURANCE BILL, 2020 Cab­i­net con­sid­ered and ap­proved the amend­ments to the Insurance Bill, 2020 which was pre­sented by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral on be­half of the Chair­man of the Cab­i­net Com­mit­tee on Leg­is­la­tion. Among the amend­ments, Cab­i­net was in­formed that the Bill seeks to re­peal the Insurance Act and in­tro­duce best prac­tices in Zim­babwe’s insurance sec­tor, which plays an im­por­tant role in so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Through the pro­posed amend­ments, Govern­ment in­tends to strengthen the in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity of the Insurance and Pen­sion Com­mis­sion and the reg­u­la­tory frame­work to cre­ate a ro­bust and in­ter­na­tion­ally re­spected insurance and pen­sion in­dus­try reg­u­la­tor; syn­chro­nise the main acts that guide the reg­u­la­tion of the insurance and pen­sions in­dus­try; ad­dress iden­ti­fied de­fi­cien­cies in the cur­rent leg­is­la­tion; and align insurance and pen­sion leg­is­la­tion to in­ter­na­tional best prac­tices in or­der to build a stronger reg­u­la­tory frame­work that pro­mote growth and de­vel­op­ment of the insurance and pen­sions in­dus­try. The Bill sets out the rules to be fol­lowed in merg­ing insurance so­ci­eties, in the trans­fer of insurance busi­ness to an­other reg­is­tered in­surer, and in the pay­ment of pre­mi­ums to the reg­is­tered in­surer when­ever an insurance bro­ker re­ceives the pre­mi­ums from pol­icy hold­ers. Cab­i­net stressed that in or­der to guard against in­sol­vency by insurance so­ci­eties, ev­ery reg­is­tered in­surer will now be re­quired to main­tain a pre­scribed level of sol­vency. It will now be com­pul­sory for insurance so­ci­eties to sub­mit fi­nan­cial state­ments within ninety days of each fi­nan­cial year. The state­ments must be pre­pared in ac­cor­dance with gen­er­ally ac­cepted ac­count­ing prac­tices. All in­sur­ers will be re­quired to sub­mit to the Com­mis­sion an ac­tu­ar­ial valu­a­tion re­port which must be har­monised with the rel­e­vant au­dit re­port. In­sur­ers who wish to con­duct elec­tronic busi­ness must get Com­mis­sion ap­proval, while the is­suance of dis­abil­ity ben­e­fits in life poli­cies will be ac­cord­ing to clearly spelt out con­di­tions. An insurance fund shall not be ex­e­cutable by cred­i­tors who are not the pol­icy own­ers. A reg­is­tered in­surer may not place as­sets out­side Zim­babwe with­out Com­mis­sion ap­proval, in­clud­ing on per­cent­ages that may be pre­scribed. In the event of cur­rency change, Cab­i­net noted that steps must be taken by the reg­is­tered per­son, in­clud­ing the ac­tu­ar­ial valu­a­tion of the insurance busi­ness in or­der to re-cal­cu­late the li­a­bil­i­ties and as­sets in line with the new cur­rency. This pro­vi­sion is ex­pected to en­hance the pro­tec­tion of pol­icy hold­ers. I NSURANCE AND COM­MIS­SION BILL, 2020 Cab­i­net con­sid­ered and ap­proved the Insurance and Pen­sions Com­mis­sion (Amend­ment) Bill, 2020 which was pre­sented by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral on be­half of the Chair­man of the Cab­i­net Com­mit­tee on Leg­is­la­tion. The Amend­ment Bill mainly seeks to en­sure the main­te­nance of a fair, safe and sta­ble insurance and pen­sions sec­tor for the ben­e­fit and pro­tec­tion of pol­icy hold­ers and pen­sion fund mem­bers. The Bill gives the Insurance Com­mis­sion the pow­ers to ac­credit ac­tu­ar­ies, au­di­tors, as­set man­agers, credit rat­ing agencies and other ser­vice providers. The com­mis­sion will con­duct in­ves­ti­ga­tions where it sees fit for the purpose of pre­vent­ing con­tra­ven­tions in the insurance sec­tor through pro­vi­sions of the Bill. The Com­mis­sion may co­op­er­ate with any PEN­SIONS su­per­vi­sory au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing for­eign law en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties or insurance and pen­sions au­thor­i­ties in in­ves­ti­ga­tions, en­force­ment, co-or­di­na­tion and har­mon­i­sa­tion of laws, pro­ce­dures and stan­dards. Among other func­tions, the board of the Insurance and Pen­sions Com­mis­sion shall en­sure com­pen­sa­tion is paid to ben­e­fi­cia­ries for losses they may in­cur, and shall de­ter­mine the level of such com­pen­sa­tion, based on the dif­fer­ent classes of insurance poli­cies or type of pen­sion or prov­i­dent fund. Above all, the Com­mis­sion shall keep and main­tain as­set reg­is­ters for in­sur­ers, insurance bro­kers, pen­sions and prov­i­dent funds. The Na­tional So­cial Se­cu­rity Author­ity, med­i­cal aid so­ci­eties and any other per­sons con­duct­ing insurance busi­ness will now be sub­ject to reg­u­la­tion by the com­mis­sion. The Insurance and Pen­sions Com­mis­sion Bill will there­fore strengthen the in­tegrity of the insurance sec­tor and en­able it to play its role in su­per­vis­ing the sec­tor. PRIN­CI­PLES OF THE AMEND­MENT TO THE CHAR­TERED SEC­RE­TARIES (PRI­VATE) ACT [CHAP­TER 23:07] Cab­i­net con­sid­ered and ap­proved the Prin­ci­ples for the Amend­ment of the Char­tered Sec­re­taries (Pri­vate) Act [Chap­ter 23:07], which were pre­sented by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral on be­half of the Min­is­ter of Jus­tice, Le­gal and Par­lia­men­tary Af­fairs. Cab­i­net was in­formed that the pro­posed amend­ments seek to ex­pand the man­date of the In­sti­tute of Char­tered Sec­re­taries and Ad­min­is­tra­tors in Zim­babwe to en­cour­age the study and prac­tice of ac­coun­tancy and au­dit­ing by mem­bers and stu­dents of the In­sti­tute. The aim is to pro­mote in­for­ma­tion and ed­u­ca­tion on ac­coun­tancy and au­dit­ing mat­ters by all ap­pro­pri­ate means, and to help the In­sti­tute to ac­quire any rights or priv­i­leges which the In­sti­tute may re­gard as nec­es­sary or con­ve­nient for its purpose in life. The amend­ments will also pro­vide for do­na­tions for pro­mot­ing the in­ter­ests of the Char­tered Gov­er­nance and Ac­coun­tancy pro­fes­sion. The In­sti­tute, to be re­named “The Char­tered Gov­er­nance and Ac­coun­tancy In­sti­tute in Zim­babwe”, will pro­vide ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing in pro­fes­sional branches which en­com­pass cor­po­rate sec­re­taries, man­agers, ad­min­is­tra­tors, tax con­sul­tants, fi­nan­cial man­agers, ac­coun­tants and au­di­tors. RE-TAR­GET­ING OF THE FOOD DEFICIT MIT­I­GA­TION PRO­GRAMME BEN­E­FI­CIA­RIES Cab­i­net ap­proved the pro­posed re-tar­get­ing of the Food Mit­i­ga­tion Pro­gramme ben­e­fi­cia­ries as pre­sented by the Min­is­ter of Pub­lic Ser­vice, Labour and So­cial Wel­fare as Act­ing Chair­man of the Cab­i­net Com­mit­tee on So­cial Ser­vices and Poverty Erad­i­ca­tion. This was in view of the need to en­sure that the pro­gramme tar­gets clearly de­serv­ing ben­e­fi­cia­ries in light of the need for flex­i­bil­ity and to do away with the de­pen­dency syn­drome among the cit­i­zenry. UN­WAR­RANTED PRICE HIKES IN SHOPS Cab­i­net takes ex­cep­tion to the re­cent un­war­ranted hikes in prices of goods and ser­vices by un­scrupu­lous busi­ness peo­ple. Govern­ment would like to in­form the na­tion that in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the mat­ter are cur­rently un­der­way, and that Govern­ment will leave no stone un­turned un­til it brings the cul­prits to book.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20201106,Key ex­pec­ta­tions for the 2021 bud­get,"ZIM­BABWE’S 2021 na­tional bud­get will be pre­sented this Novem­ber, with a lot at stake in terms of im­prove­ments in pub­lic ser­vice de­liv­ery from the gov­ern­ment.  e bud­get comes when the econ­omy is grad­u­ally re­cov­er­ing from the Covid-19 in­duced busi­ness shut­down and when par­tial dol­lar­i­sa­tion is help­ing to re­cal­i­brate the econ­omy from years of cur­rency dis­tor­tions, costly con­sump­tion sub­si­dies and high lev­els of in­fla­tion. e mar­ket has seen some mea­sure of price sta­bil­ity in the last four months due to the tight­en­ing of money sup­ply and chan­nel­ing of for­eign cur­rency to­wards the auc­tion mar­ket. How­ever, civil ser­vice wage dis­putes have grounded the ed­u­ca­tion and health sec­tors to a halt at a time when poverty lev­els have risen sharply. Sim­i­larly, in­fla­tion still re­mains very high with year-on-year in­fla­tion for Septem­ber recorded at 659%. e In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) ex­pects the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy to de­cline by 10,4% in 2020 be­fore reg­is­ter­ing a 2,5% growth in 2021.  e World Bank projects a 10% con­trac­tion in 2020, be­fore re­cov­er­ing to 2,8% growth rate in 2021. In 2019, tax and non-tax rev­enue col­lec­tions were pro­jected at ZW$58,6 bil­lion while ex­pen­di­ture was bud­geted at ZW$63,6 bil­lion, leav­ing a bud­get deficit of ZW$5 bil­lion. How­ever, high lev­els of in­fla­tion meant that the gov­ern­ment has so far col­lected ZW$84,97 bil­lion in nine months from Jan­uary to Septem­ber 2020. Rev­enue pro­jec­tions for the whole of 2020 are there­fore ex­pected to eclipse ZW$140 bil­lion (US$1,72 bil­lion). is means that the trea­sury has lost more than 50% of the tax rev­enue it col­lected in 2017 and 2018. Crit­i­cally, the econ­omy sank deeper than the of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment fig­ures in the last two years. Covid-19 has se­verely bat­tered the lo­cal econ­omy, with the Tourism and Hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor writ­ing down over US$1 bil­lion in for­eign earn­ings. Sim­i­larly other key sec­tors such as re­tail­ing, trans­porta­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion, real es­tate and man­u­fac­tur­ing have also lost mil­lions due to trade re­stric­tions and eco­nomic shut­down. Re­cur­ring eco­nomic con­straints for Zim­babwe in­clude suc­ces­sive droughts and low pro­duc­tiv­ity from agri­cul­ture, high lev­els of in­fla­tion (from un­re­strained money sup­ply), power and for­eign cur­rency short­ages, over­reg­u­la­tion, cur­rency dis­tor­tions and policy in­con­sis­ten­cies. As such ex­pec­ta­tions are very high that the bud­get will ad­dress the fol­low­ing thorny as­pects: Civil ser­vice re­mu­ner­a­tion e past two years have seen a se­ri­ous wage com­pres­sion for the civil ser­vice with en­try level (B1) civil ser­vants cur­rently earn­ing ZW$11 350 (US$140) if the Covid-19 al­lowance of US$75 is fac­tored in.  is means that most civil ser­vants can­not af­ford the con­sumer food bas­ket of six which costs ZW$21 000 (US$258) as of Septem­ber 2020.  e To­tal Con­sump­tion Poverty Line (TCPL) for a fam­ily of five cost ZW$18 000 (US$221) in the same month, this means that by Zim­bab­wean stan­dards al­most all civil ser­vants are liv­ing in ab­ject poverty. e gov­ern­ment has been on record to sell its bud­get sur­pluses or achiev­ing rev­enue col­lec­tion tar­gets in a de­clin­ing econ­omy.  e bud­get should there­fore ad­dress civil ser­vice re­mu­ner­a­tion gaps and con­di­tions of ser­vice so that ser­vice de­liv­ery is re­stored in key sec­tors such as ed­u­ca­tion and health care. With­out fully ad­dress­ing re­mu­ner­a­tion as­pects, Zim­babwe will con­tinue to lose its highly trained per­son­nel in all gov­ern­ment de­part­ments and the pri­vate sec­tor as well. So­cial safety nets Re­cur­ring droughts, high in­fla­tion and ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment lev­els have trig­gered an in­crease in ex­treme poverty lev­els in the last two years.  e World Food Pro­gramme (WFP) es­ti­mates that over 7,7 mil­lion Zim­bab­weans are in need of food aid be­fore the har­vest sea­son be­gins in March 2021. e World Bank pre­dicts that the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing in ex­treme poverty is pro­jected to in­crease from 6,6 mil­lion in 2019 to 7,6 mil­lion (50% of the Zim­bab­wean Pop­u­la­tion) in 2020. Eco­nomic de­cline has seen an in­crease of in­for­mal­i­sa­tion with most jobs in the Small to Medium En­ter­prises (SMEs) lack­ing job se­cu­rity, in­come con­sis­tency and in­surance. With this in mind, trea­sury needs to in­crease its bud­get al­lo­ca­tions for health and child care, ba­sic ed­u­ca­tion, so­cial ameni­ties, dis­abil­ity ben­e­fits and other fa­cil­i­ties for the so­cially vul­ner­a­ble such as chil­dren and preg­nant women.  ese so­cial ser­vices will also need to fac­tor in poor ur­ban house­holds who have been af­fected by Covid-19 lock­downs and in­crease in un­em­ploy­ment. Sim­i­larly, there is need to al­lo­cate more fund­ing to­wards wa­ter pro­vi­sion in Harare and Bu­l­awayo where more than 2,5 mil­lion res­i­dents do not have ac­cess to safe drink­ing wa­ter. Zim­bab­weans have been call­ing on gov­ern­ment to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce its mil­i­tary ex­pen­di­ture and in­crease spend­ing on so­cial ser­vices. Eco­nomic in­cen­tives e eco­nomic de­cline wit­nessed in 2020 re­quired a gen­er­ous stim­u­lus pack­age for the econ­omy es­pe­cially for sec­tors se­verely bat­tered by the pan­demic such as tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity. How­ever there has been no trace on the bene­fac­tors of the ZW$18 bil­lion (US$222 mil­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age an­nounced by the gov­ern­ment in May 2020 with the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe In­dus­tries (CZI) and Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ZNCC) not aware of any ben­e­fi­cia­ries. Gov­ern­ment claimed that over ZW$6 bil­lion (US$74 mil­lion) had been directed to­wards farm­ers, though this was never ver­i­fied or au­dited. To boost eco­nomic pro­duc­tiv­ity and re­duce the cost of do­ing busi­ness, trea­sury needs to re­duce Ex­cise Duty paid on fuel and re­duce the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate. Tax in­cen­tives should also be con­sid­ered for the tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor to pro­mote do­mes­tic tourism (in light of in­come ero­sion), curb des­ti­na­tion costs and at­tract for­eign tourists as for­eign travel re­stric­tions are be­ing lifted. It will take months be­fore ho­tels, gam­ing, travel and tours and leisure ser­vices get the pre-Covid tourist num­bers, hence in­cen­tives are key in get­ting re­trenched work­ers back to work in re­sort hotspots such as Vic­to­ria Falls, Kariba, Mutare, Nyanga, Vumba, Mato­pos and oth­ers. In­fra­struc­ture e state of pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture has never been as dire as it is now. Years of un­der­in­vest­ment in the coun­try’s rail­way net­work, high­ways and ur­ban roads, en­ergy gen­er­a­tion plants, sports fa­cil­i­ties, bor­der posts, wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion fa­cil­i­ties has left the coun­try be­hind in terms of in­fra­struc­ture stand­ing in South­ern Africa. In the first half of 2020, only of ZW$2,1 bil­lion was in­vested in in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment out of the bud­geted ZW$12 bil­lion. To ad­dress this in­fra­struc­ture deficit, trea­sury needs to set up an ex­plicit pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship (PPP) Act that ad­dresses thorny as­pects such as re­pay­ment terms and rem­edy for con­trac­tual dis­putes among other as­pects so as to at­tract pri­vate sec­tor fund­ing. e ex­pec­ta­tion from the bud­get is that more than 30% of the bud­get is di­rectly chan­neled to­wards in­fra­struc­ture projects such as city dams and wa­ter projects. To ad­dress the poor state of ur­ban roads, the gov­ern­ment needs to con­sider re­vert­ing back to per­mit­ting ur­ban coun­cils col­lec­tion of ve­hi­cle term li­censes, un­der a trans­par­ent mech­a­nism where funds are ring fenced from coun­cils’ abuse on re­cur­ring ex­pen­di­ture. Toll fees can be chan­neled to­wards ru­ral district coun­cil roads and high­way main­te­nance. Debt man­age­ment Cur­rently there is no clar­ity on the up to date lev­els of for­eign debt, do­mes­tic debt and debt con­tracted by the cen­tral bank to fi­nance the auc­tion sys­tem and other quasi fis­cal op­er­a­tions in the last three years. Trea­sury is ex­pected to state these fig­ures and the re­pay­ment terms for the ben­e­fit of the tax­payer. Sim­i­larly, there is an ur­gent need for a debt re­pay­ment plan es­pe­cially on for­eign debt as­sumed by the cen­tral bank from var­i­ous lo­cal pro­duc­ers in 2019.  e debt is af­fect­ing raw ma­te­rial im­ports and new lines of credit. Zim­babwe has not tabled any cred­i­ble debt re­pay­ment plan since the Lima agree­ment fell through. Over­all the up­com­ing bud­get needs to break away from the past bud­gets where more taxes are loaded on the tax payer while bil­lions are al­lo­cated to mil­i­tary ex­pen­di­ture at the ex­pense of crit­i­cal ser­vices such as ed­u­ca­tion and health care.  e Covid-19 pan­demic and global eco­nomic de­cline also calls for eco­nomic stim­u­lus through tax cuts and var­i­ous other sup­ply side poli­cies aimed at re­duc­ing the cost of do­ing busi­ness. Zim­babwe’s tax model needs to be sim­pli­fied and re­mod­eled to boost ex­ports and lo­cal pro­duc­tion in­stead of im­port­ing fin­ished goods from China, Sin­ga­pore and South Africa. Pub­lic ser­vice de­liv­ery can only be ef­fi­cient if civil ser­vants are re­warded with liv­ing wages that are ad­justed in line with in­fla­tion and in­crease in rev­enue col­lec­tions by the trea­sury.",津巴布韦

Clr Manyenyeni used the plat­form, which is meant to pool in­sights from non-gov­ern­men­tal sec­tors in China and African coun­tries and pro­mot­ing prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two, to high­light in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in Zim­babwe. “The coun­try has the land, hard­work­ing peo­ple, favourable weather con­di­tions, among other char­ac­ter­is­tics; hence, those who in­tended to in­vest af­ter the elec­tions could find them­selves be­hind the boat,” he said. Over 400 par­tic­i­pants - in­clud­ing Heads of State and lo­cal govern­ment lead­ers from African coun­tries and China, in­clud­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives from busi­ness and com­merce - at­tended the fo­rum, which was of­fi­cially opened by China’s Vice Pres­i­dent Mr Wang Qis­han. Run­ning un­der the theme “Poverty Al­le­vi­a­tion and Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment”, the two-day fo­rum saw del­e­gates de­lib­er­at­ing on key top­ics, namely train­ing of tal­ents as a driv­ing force for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and co­op­er­a­tion for pro­duc­tion; ca­pac­ity en­hance­ment as a means to push for­ward joint de­vel­op­ment of China and Africa. “The coun­try is cur­rently op­er­at­ing un­der a mantra of ‘We are open for busi­ness’. What that means is that the coun­try that has been for­got­ten - about, that has been avoided for rea­sons po­lit­i­cal, is now say­ing to the world come and talk to us, come and work with us; let’s do things to­gether,” he said. “… The new Pres­i­dent (Mnan­gagwa) has worked on a scheme to make Zim­babwe more at­trac­tive. He is en­gag­ing out­wardly for new part­ner­ships, new op­por­tu­ni­ties. He is send­ing the mes­sage of Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170615,China en­sures its po­si­tion in Africa,"China’s grow­ing global in­flu­ence now reaches deep into Africa — at a time when Western pow­ers are re­treat­ing from the con­ti­nent. THE re­la­tion­ship is crit­i­cal to China’s eco­nomic fu­ture as it sources much of its en­ergy and re­sources from Africa. To en­sure its po­si­tion and to ward off any crit­i­cism of be­ing “a new coloniser”, China is pour­ing bil­lions into African in­fra­struc­ture and ed­u­ca­tion. At Ren­min Univer­sity, one of the best in China, this new ap­proach is clearly in ev­i­dence. Michael Dizha is a re­cip­i­ent of a con­fu­cius schol­ar­ship that pro­vides tu­ition, ac­com­mo­da­tion, food and other liv­ing ex­penses. He is just one of 60 000 African stu­dents cur­rently re­ceiv­ing such schol­ar­ships, and that will in­crease to al­most 100 000 in three years. Mr Dizha says his aim is to be­come a mid­dle­man when he re­turns home af­ter his stud­ies. “I’m learn­ing Chi­nese lan­guage and cul­ture so I can make my coun­try­men fully un­der­stand what the Chi­nese are do­ing, as more and more Chi­nese are com­ing to Zim­babwe,” he said. The schol­ar­ships are an im­por­tant plank in China’s soft power push into Africa. It is a way to bind Africa’s next gen­er­a­tion of elites to China. Mr Dizha’s room­mate Sad­son Mku­mira, also from Zim­babwe, says the African stu­dents will act as a bridge. “We will be lead­ers and I hope to con­vince more in­vestors to come to Zim­babwe but in favourable terms. I ex­pect 50/50, a win for ev­ery­body,” he said. China needs Africa’s raw ma­te­ri­als to fuel its fu­ture growth, and to make sure it gets them, China is in­vest­ing an­other $60 bil­lion in roads, rail­ways, ports, pipe­lines and com­mu­ni­ca­tion net­works. Pro­fes­sor He Wen­ping from the Chi- nese Academy of So­cial Sci­ences says it is a win-win sit­u­a­tion. “China needs a new mar­ket to off­load its over­ca­pac­ity, Africa needs to be in­dus­tri­alised and de­vel­oped. So, it’s a per­fect com­bi­na­tion,” he said. Since 2009, Africa has be­come China’s top trad­ing part­ner. It is China’s sec­ond big­gest source of crude oil — from coun­tries like Nige­ria, An­gola and Su­dan. Namibia will pro­vide ura­nium for China to be­come a world leader in nu­clear power. Iron ore, cop­per, zinc and di­a­monds are also flow­ing out of the con­ti­nent. China’s trade with Africa has in­creased forty­fold in the last 20 years. Ini­tially, much of the trade was one way and some la­belled China as ‘the new colo­nial­ists’ and there were al­le­ga­tions of cor­rup­tion, mis­treat­ment and shoddy work. Pro­fes­sor He says that view is driven by western pow­ers and is now out­dated. It is not a curse, but a bless­ing. It im­proves African peo­ple’s liv­ing stan­dard, and cre­ates more busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties. It is not forced but based on mu­tual ne­go­ti­a­tion. In the last decade, China has re­vamped its ap­proach and there is more tech­nol­ogy and skills trans­fer now. Har­riet Kar­iuki from Kenya, who is study­ing a doc­tor­ate at Peking Univer­sity, sees China as the best op­tion as its de­vel­op­ment model has lifted half-a-bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty, but be­lieves Africans still have to get more out of the re­la­tion­ship. “Africans in gen­eral should use this as a chance to learn from mis­takes of colo­nial­ism pe­riod and ac­tu­ally put their own poli­cies that en­force col­lab­o­ra­tion and learn from Chi­nese,” she said. China’s soft power ap­proach in Africa, un­like other parts of the world, is hav­ing some suc­cess. Re­cent poll re­sults from the Pew Re­search Cen­tre found 75 per cent of Africans have a favourable view about China’s in­flu­ence.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20141205,China and Brazil slam rich world over cash pledged to deal with cli­mate crises,"China and Brazil have crit­i­cised the amount of money wealthy coun­tries have pledged to help poorer na­tions deal with global warm­ing in a sign that seal­ing a cli­mate treaty next year still faces se­ri­ous snags. Speak­ing on the eve of this week’s UN cli­mate talks in Lima, Peru, top ne­go­tia­tors from both coun­tries said the nearly $10bn that the US, Ja­pan and Euro­pean coun­tries have promised in re­cent months was far from the $100bn in an­nual cli­mate fi­nanc­ing that de­vel­op­ing na­tions are ex­pect­ing from 2020. The crit­i­cisms came as Ox­fam said that Brazil should also start chan­nelling money to poorer coun­tries, de­spite be­ing deemed a de­vel­op­ing coun­try by the UN. Howev- er, the aid agency - which based its cal­cu­la­tions on in­come dis­tri­bu­tion, poverty lev­els and green­house gas emis­sions since 1990 - did not in­clude China. Ox­fam said the pledged an­nual $100bn cli­mate fund would not be enough to both curb global warm­ing and help coun­tries adapt to a chang­ing cli­mate. “Sub-Sa­ha­ran African coun­tries alone will need $62bn per year to invest in cli­mate adap­ta­tion,” it said. José An­to­nio Mar­con­des de Car­valho, Brazil’s chief cli­mate ne­go­tia­tor, said the money pledged so far was wel­come. “But we are also mind­ful of the com­mit­ments [OECD] coun­tries made to bring $100bn a year from 2020 on­ward into fight­ing cli­mate change.” Xie Zhen­hua, China’s chief cli­mate ne­go­tia­tor, said: “The num­ber is not ideal be­cause $10bn is still far away from $100bn.” Their com­ments are a jolt­ing re­minder of the hur­dles that re­main ahead of a global cli­mate deal due to be signed in Paris at the end of next year, de­spite the ex­cite­ment gen­er­ated by the US and China when they jointly an­nounced plans to com­bat global warm­ing nearly three weeks ago. A stand-off be­tween the two big­gest green­house gas emit­ters has blocked years of ef­fort to pro­duce a mean­ing­ful in­ter­na­tional cli­mate treaty, along with squab­bles over the level of aid from de­vel­oped coun­tries deemed most re­spon­si­ble for global warm­ing. The UN Green Cli­mate Fund said on Fri­day that it had raised $9.7bn from 22 coun­tries in its first fundrais­ing drive this year. This is one of the big­gest amounts raised in such a short pe­riod.

China con­tin­ued to sup­port African de­vel­op­ment into the 21st Cen­tury and Africa’s grow­ing com­mit­ment to en­hance its col­lec­tive strength through unity. The phrase “African de­vel­op­ment” in­di­cates the fo­cus of China’s ex­cep­tion­ally im­por­tant role in Africa in sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ment ac­cord­ing to Africa’s own agenda, as well as South-South Co­op­er­a­tion, Africa-Asia col­lab­o­ra­tion, and com­mon de­vel­op­ment goals. China has also sup­ported Africa’s ef­forts to ap­ply eco­nomic growth to so­cial de­vel­op­ment. “Africa is at the ini­tial stage of an eco­nomic take-off and China is striv­ing to achieve mod­erni­sa­tion. “Both sides are fast in­te­grat­ing into the on­go­ing eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion,” Premier Li Ke­qiang said at the African Union head­quar­ters in Ethiopia in 2014, in an Africa Pol­icy State­ment from the new Chi­nese ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping. “China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion, which is con­sis­tent with the trend of the world, re­quires that we base our­selves on our re­spec­tive de­vel­op­ment stages, give con­sid­er­a­tion to each other’s con­cerns, and con­stantly seek and ex­pand the ar­eas of con­verg­ing in­ter­ests.” “We should not limit our co­op­er­a­tion to en­ergy, re­sources and in­fra­struc­ture but ex­pand it to in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, ur­ban­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion and many other ar­eas, and put greater em­pha­sis on green and low-car­bon de­vel­op­ment as well as eco­log­i­cal and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion,” Premier Li said. “What is more, we should com­bine the role of the mar­ket with that of the gov­ern­ment, en­hance the syn­ergy of busi­ness-so­ci­ety in­ter­ac­tions and in­no­vate on prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion, so as to make China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion a model of com­ple­men­tar­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults and ef­fi­ciency.” This is known as the 4-6-1 speech. It con­tains four main prin­ci­ples, in­clud­ing equal­ity, sol­i­dar­ity, in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment and in­no­va­tive, prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion. Six ar­eas are pro­posed to up­grade co­op­er­a­tion, in­clud­ing in­dus­trial and fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion, poverty re­duc­tion, eco­log­i­cal and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, peace and se­cu­rity. Th­ese will in­form the forth­com­ing Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa in De­cem­ber, fol­low­ing the 6th min­is­te­rial meet­ing of Focac. Premier Li spoke of the need to deepen the China-Africa re­la­tion­ship by en­hanc­ing col­lec­tive di­a­logue and prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion through Focac. He noted that, com­ing to the 15th an­niver­sary of Focac in 2015, there is need to im­prove this mech­a­nism, en­rich its con­tent, and make the plat­form more prac­ti­cal and ef­fi­cient. More and more African coun­tries have be­gun to “look east” in the new mil­len­nium, in­clud­ing South Africa which is a mem­ber of the BRICS group­ing of emerg­ing economies — Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China, South Africa. “Zim­babwe’s Look East pol­icy has yielded pos­i­tive re­sults that have be­come an in­spi­ra­tion for many African coun­tries,” one African am­bas­sador said. The two-way trade vol­ume has in­creased, as has China’s in­vest­ment and project con­tract­ing, and co­op­er­a­tion has ex­panded rapidly in the ar­eas of agri­cul­ture, in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy, among oth­ers. China is Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, hav­ing de­vel­oped a mu­tual, vi­brant part­ner­ship with trade vol­umes in­creas­ing ex­po­nen­tially over the past decade, ris­ing from US$10 bil­lion in 2000 to al­most US$200 bil­lion in 2012, and was pro­jected to reach US$220 bil­lion for 2014. Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa has grown over the past decade, with direct in­vest­ment es­ti­mated at more than US$30 bil­lion in 2014. China has be­come Zim­babwe’s sec­ond largest trad­ing part­ner af­ter South Africa, with the trade vol­ume reach­ing $1.24 bil­lion for the five-year pe­riod since 2010, which is dou­ble the vol­ume recorded for the pre­vi­ous five years. Zim­babwe and at least 15 other African coun­tries have re­ceived Ap­proved Des­ti­na­tion Sta­tus, as a des­ti­na­tion for Chi­nese tourists, al­though Africa is still viewed as an un­known des­ti­na­tion and vis­i­tor num­bers re­main low. Two-thirds of Chi­nese tourists visit neigh­bour­ing coun­tries in Asia. China’s prin­ci­pled ac­tion in the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, es­pe­cially over the Zim­babwe is­sue in 2008, has drawn ever more re­spect among African coun­tries who see China as a re­li­able de­vel­op­ment part­ner that re­spects their as­pi­ra­tions and sovereignty. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment “does not agree to any form of sanc­tions against Zim­babwe.” Al­though there was no doubt about the course of ac­tion, it was costly, as China had to ex­pend its own po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal at a time when it was seek­ing to strengthen re­la­tions with Europe and the United States. China ap­pre­ci­ates the con­sis­tency of Zim­babwe’s for­eign pol­icy in its sup­port for China’s as­pi­ra­tions on re­uni­fi­ca­tion through the One-China Pol­icy, and “views Zim­babwe as a trust­wor­thy friend and an im­por­tant part­ner.” Now that China has sur­passed the United States as the world’s largest econ­omy, a feat achieved in De­cem­ber 2014, the woo­ing is in re­verse, and China’s Pres­i­dent Xi was feted this year in Wash­ing­ton and in Lon­don, where he resided at Buck­ing­ham Palace as guest of the Bri­tish royal fam­ily. To­gether, China and Africa are press­ing for re­form in global gov­er­nance through the United Na­tions struc­tures, and es­pe­cially rep­re­sen­ta­tion on the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. Agri­cul­ture and food se­cu­rity has been a main fo­cus of Chi­nese co­op­er­a­tion with Zim­babwe, through the con­struc­tion of dams and wa­ter treat­ment plants, as well as pro­vi­sion of trac­tors and com­bine har­vesters for ru­ral de­vel­op­ment. The way for­ward re­quires deeper un­der­stand­ing of the re­al­i­ties of Past, Present and Fu­ture re­la­tions, in­clud­ing cul­tural and his­tor­i­cal, as well as greater in­ter­ac­tion through aca­demic and me­dia ex­changes, vol­un­teers, tourism, peo­ple-to-peo­ple and other sec­tors, and ex­pand­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties for joint re­search be­tween in­sti­tu­tions and in­di­vid­u­als in var­i­ous pri­or­ity ar­eas, such as in­fra­struc­ture, poverty erad­i­ca­tion, and history. A key area of co­op­er­a­tion is that of shar­ing in­for­ma­tion and knowl­edge, strength­en­ing the plat­form for col­lec­tive di­a­logue and ex­change of views, aca­demic ex­change of ideas, and an ed­u­ca­tional ini­tia­tive to strengthen un­der­stand­ing of China-Zim­babwe re­la­tions and po­ten­tial. Both sides are frank in their as­sess­ment of the dearth of ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion and re­li­able per­spec­tives, and the need for more aca­demic ex­changes be­tween uni­ver­si­ties, re­search in­sti­tutes and think tanks, as well as ed­u­ca­tion, sports, arts and cul­ture, among oth­ers. Sym­posia on China-Africa and China-Zim­babwe re­la­tions are a good ex­am­ple of the kind of in­ter­ac­tion that can be strength­ened be­tween Chi­nese and African in­sti­tu­tions and in­di­vid­u­als, and seven have been held in Zim­babwe over the past seven years, in­volv­ing some very se­nior schol­ars from both sides. The es­tab­lish­ment of Sardc’s In­sti­tute for China-Africa Stud­ies in Southern Africa, in Harare, is an­other mile­stone in this re­gard.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20190610,"22 un­der­aged chil­dren get mar­ried a minute, high­est preva­lence in Africa","AN es­ti­mated 115 mil­lion boys and men around the world were mar­ried as chil­dren, Unicef has said in its first ever in-depth anal­y­sis of child grooms. Of these, one in five chil­dren, or 23 mil­lion, were mar­ried be­fore the age of 15. Us­ing data from 82 coun­tries, the study re­veals that child mar­riage among boys is preva­lent across a range of coun­tries around the world, span­ning sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean, South and East Asia as well as the Pa­cific. “Mar­riage steals child­hood,” said Unicef’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, Hen­ri­etta Fore. “Child grooms are forced to take on adult re­spon­si­bil­i­ties for which they may not be ready. Early mar­riage brings early father­hood, and with it added pres­sure to pro­vide for a fam­ily, cut­ting short ed­u­ca­tion and job op­por­tu­ni­ties.” Ac­cord­ing to the data, the Cen­tral African Repub­lic has the high­est preva­lence of child mar­riage among males (28%), fol­lowed by Nicaragua (19%) and Mada­gas­car (13%). The new es­ti­mates bring the to­tal num­ber of child brides and child grooms to 765 mil­lion. Girls re­main dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fected, with one in five young women aged 20 to 24 years old get­ting mar­ried be­fore their 18th birth­day, com­pared to 1 in 30 young men. Speak­ing from Nige­ria on Fri­day, James El­der, Unicef’s eastern and South­ern Africa chief of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, said the num­bers were “over­whelm­ing”. “When you break it down it’s around 12 mil­lion new child brides or grooms per year. So, when you’re liv­ing in the mo­ment, that trans­lates to 22 mar­riages per minute. “One as­so­ciates mar­riages with hap­pi­ness and cel­e­bra­tion, and yet, child mar­riages are quite the op­po­site. A mar­riage should be a union of peo­ple try­ing to in­crease their chances to take on and do well in the world. Child mar­riages do the op­po­site — they deprive kids of op­por­tu­ni­ties.” “For ex­am­ple, we know for a fact that ev­ery year of ad­di­tional school­ing can in­crease a per­son’s wages by about 10%, and yet we know that chil­dren who get mar­ried tend to drop out of school, they tend to have chil­dren younger, and those chil­dren then suf­fer poor nu­tri­tion, poor stim­u­la­tion, poor health care, and so the cy­cle of poverty is per­pet­u­ated,” says El­der. El­der says the stag­ger­ing num­ber of child mar­riages has taken away a world of op­por­tu­ni­ties from mil­lions of boys and girls. There are many fac­tors, says El­der. “Poverty, the per­cep­tion that mar­riage will pro­vide pro­tec­tion, fam­ily hon­our, so­cial SU­DANESE po­lice have fired tear gas at protesters tak­ing part in a “civil dis­obe­di­ence” cam­paign, called in the wake of a deadly crack­down on demon­stra­tors, that be­gan yes­ter­day. Protesters gath­ered tyres, tree trunks and rocks to build new road­blocks in Khar­toum’s north­ern Ba­hari district, an un­named wit­ness told AFP news agency, but riot po­lice swiftly moved in and fired tear gas to dis­perse the crowd. “Al­most all in­ter­nal roads of Ba­hari have road­blocks. Protesters are even stop­ping res­i­dents from go­ing to work,” said the wit­ness. The lat­est bid by demon­stra­tors to close off streets in the cap­i­tal comes nearly a week after a deadly raid on a sit-in out­side the army head­quar­ters that killed dozens. The bloody crack­down last Mon­day prompted the Su­danese Pro­fes­sion­als’ Association (SPA), which norms like cus­tom­ary and religious laws that con­done the prac­tice, as well as in­ad­e­quate leg­isla­tive frame­works. All those things are at play, but it is a com­pli­cated is­sue.” Ac­cord­ing to El­der, child mar­riage is preva­lent through­out the world. “Where I live and work in eastern and south­ern Africa there are a lot of child mar­riages. “In South Africa alone, around 6% of girls marry be­fore they turn 18. But that fig­ure might be higher be­cause a lot of it doesn’t get re­ported. “Asia used to be the area with the high­est per­cent­age, and it still has the high­est num­ber, but the high­est per­cent­age now goes to this re­gion.” El­der says fig­ures in Latin Amer­ica are also very high. “It is a global phe­nom­e­non that Unicef works on around the world. Ethiopia used to [be] one of the top five coun­tries in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa for child mar­riage, and that preva­lence has dropped by about a third in the past 10 years. So, things can be done where there is will from com­mu­ni­ties all the way up to the govern­ment.” But it is not easy, says El­der. “You’re deal­ing with a per­cep­tion in a fam­ily or com­mu­nity or cus­tom­ary or religious laws — these are big things to chal­lenge.” Some of these per­cep­tions are that early mar­riage pro­tects chil­dren, es­pe­cially girls, and that it can help re­duce poverty. “But we have the stats to show that it ac­tu­ally ac­cen­tu­ates rather than re­duces poverty. And it cer­tainly doesn’t pro­tect girls, it puts them more at risk of in­juries dur­ing child­birth, or death . . . The big­gest so­lu­tion is to em­power ado­les­cent girls and that is such a right in prac­tice and a right in prin­ci­ple, but that takes time.” “Com­mu­ni­ties and coun­tries need to start un­der­stand­ing that gen­der bal­ances are not just a phrase. There is prob­a­bly no more pow­er­ful way to in­crease a coun­try’s econ­omy than to keep girls in school and give them a qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion. “As Unicef we are lis­ten­ing to com­mu­ni­ties and then start­ing a con­ver­sa­tion around why, de­spite cus­tom­ary or religious laws or tra­di­tions, child mar­riage is ac­tu­ally work­ing against the pros­per­ity of those com­mu­ni­ties as well as against the health and well-be­ing of girls.” With boys, the con­cerns are tak­ing on early father­hood and missing out on for­mal school­ing, re­duc­ing the chance of gain­ing good or in­deed any em­ploy­ment, says El­der. “With girls it’s even more pro­nounced. Their odds of ex­pe­ri­enc­ing do­mes­tic vi­o­lence are in­creased, they are more likely to be­come preg­nant dur­ing ado­les­cence... “So, the eco­nomic prac­tice of keep­ing them in school as long as pos­si­ble de­lays their moth­er­hood. We know a woman who has re­ceived a sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion in­creases the chances of her daugh­ter re­ceiv­ing an ed­u­ca­tion three­fold. “All those things in­crease a mother’s abil­ity to care for her child and pro­vide ba­sic nu­tri­tion, make sure the child is vac­ci­nated, which en­sure early brain de­vel­op­ment. South Africa is ac­tu­ally a leader in this. “You are build­ing moms and dads who play with their chil­dren, stim­u­late them, tell them sto­ries, play games — these things have a huge in­flu­ence on a child’s brain. “But when you have a 15-year-old be­com­ing a mom or dad . . . they don’t know that. And so, you lose a huge op­por­tu­nity to stim­u­late that baby — for free, there is no cost to some­thing like that,” El­der said. — AFP THIRTY years after the Chi­nese govern­ment crushed a stu­dent-led demon­stra­tion for demo­cratic re­form and against govern­ment cor­rup­tion, a for­mer AP pho­tog­ra­pher says the coun­try needs to move for­ward and “come clean on what hap­pened.” China has voiced its “strong dis­sat­is­fac­tion and firm op­po­si­tion” towards com­ments by the United States on the 30th an­niver­sary of the Chi­nese govern­ment’s vi­o­lent re­sponse to stu­dent-led protests in Bei­jing’s Tianan­men Square. In a state­ment on Mon­day, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo urged Bei­jing to mark the June 4 an­niver­sary by pro­vid­ing a full ac­count of the bloody crack­down and re­leas­ing all pris­on­ers jailed for fight­ing hu­man rights abuses. His com­ments elicited a strong re­sponse on Tues­day by the Chi­nese em­bassy in the US, which said in a state­ment that Pom­peo’s re­marks were made “out of prej­u­dice and ar­ro­gance” and grossly in­ter­fered with China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs. It added that the Chi­nese govern­ment and peo­ple reached a ver­dict long ago on what it called “the po­lit­i­cal in­ci­dent of the late 1980s”, and that China’s “rapid” eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and “con­tin­u­ous progress in democ­racy and the rule of law” showed it was fol­low­ing the right path. Rights groups and wit­nesses say the num­ber of those killed in the vi­o­lence could run into the thou­sands. Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties have never re­leased a full death toll and have banned any pub­lic com­mem­o­ra­tion. “China’s hu­man rights are in the best pe­riod ever,” it said. Thirty years ago, the Chi­nese govern­ment ended a weeks-long stand­off with pro-democ­racy demon­stra­tors by declar­ing mar­tial law and or­der­ing armed troops into Tianan­men Square to break up the protests. Bei­jing has never given a toll on how many died in the vi­o­lent crack­down in the heart of the cap­i­tal, but es­ti­mates by hu­man rights groups and ac­tivists range from a few hun­dred to thou­sands. In com­ments made yes­ter­day dur­ing a ma­jor Asian se­cu­rity sum­mit in Sin­ga­pore, China’s De­fence Min­is­ter de­fended the crack­down as the “cor­rect” pol­icy to end “po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence” at the time. The na­tion­al­is­tic state-run tabloid Global Times hailed the govern­ment’s han­dling of Tianan­men as a “vac­ci­na­tion” for Chi­nese so­ci­ety “against any ma­jor po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in the fu­ture”. — AFP In a bid to re­vive the ne­go­ti­a­tions, the Ethiopian prime min­is­ter held sep­a­rate meet­ings with the two sides in Khar­toum on Fri­day. “The army, the peo­ple and po­lit­i­cal forces have to act with courage and re­spon­si­bil­ity by tak­ing quick steps towards a demo­cratic and con­sen­sual tran­si­tional pe­riod,” Abiy said in a state­ment after the meet­ings. “The army has to pro­tect the se­cu­rity of the coun­try and its peo­ple and po­lit­i­cal forces have to think about the fu­ture of the coun­try.” But three mem­bers of an op­po­si­tion del­e­ga­tion who met the Ethiopian prime min­is­ter were later ar­rested, their aides said on Satur­day. Op­po­si­tion politi­cian Mo­hamed Es­mat was ar­rested on Fri­day, and Is­mail Jalab, a leader of the rebel Su­dan Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Move­ment-North (SPLM-N), was taken from his home. SPLM-N spokesman Mubarak Ar­dol was also ar­rested. — Al Jazeera",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20171008,The lit­tle things that make China great,"AN IN­TER­EST­ING three weeks, no doubt. Bri­tish sci­en­tists dis­cov­ered that the Earth was shaped via the melt­ing and evap­o­ra­tion of a num­ber of mini-plan­ets. Good ol’ Don­ald Trump emerged from the line of scrim­mage no bet­ter than a spar­row on a driz­zly morn­ing af­ter squar­ing up against NFL play­ers and sup­port­ers of the grid­iron sport. And Kim Jong Un rat­tled many with his mis­sile tri­als, brew­ing lots of con­ster­na­tion in lands yon­der. But as this un­folded, some­thing was ris­ing else­where, softly but em­phat­i­cally im­print­ing gi­ant im­pres­sions on the globe. China un­leashed its high-speed train on the Bei­jing-Shang­hai track on Septem­ber 21. At 350km/h, the rail beast is the fastest in the world, clock­ing the 1 250km jour­ney within just four-and-a-half hours! What is more, the tech­nol­ogy was de­vel­oped do­mes­ti­cally; un­der­girded by ever-evolv­ing in­no­va­tions never fath­omed in the West. This cer­tainly makes Eurostar, Deutsche Bahn and oth­ers seem like Mary Pop­pins fan­tasies. But hey, there is sullen re­flec­tion in the midst of this show of might, es­pe­cially for an African heart. China — like much of Africa to­day — was sad­dled with poverty not so long ago. It has, nev­er­the­less, spec­tac­u­larly leapfrogged most “su­per­pow­ers” at a speed its lat­est bul­let train can only cap­ture metaphor­i­cally. With its hu­mon­gous US$7 tril­lion-plus re­serve and a run of year-on-year eco­nomic growth span­ning one decade, the Ori­en­tal na­tion even has mighty Amer­ica fret­ting. Yet, the lin­ger­ing ques­tion is: Where is Africa in this pic­ture? What keeps ar­rest­ing its in­cli­na­tion to de­vel­op­ment? The an­swer is quite sim­ple. The ar­ras sep­a­rat­ing the con­ti­nent and progress partly com­prises un­savoury sub-cul­tures that have been al­lowed to mu­tate over years. We have ex­punged seem­ingly minute de­tails of our ex­is­tence, re­plac­ing them with foul at­ti­tudes to­wards so­cial or­der and a creepy work ethic. Since Freud and Pi­aget, con­tem­po­rary psy­chol­o­gists have con­tin­ued to ham­mer home the point re­gard­ing how hu­mans de­velop cul­ture from prac­tice. It fol­lows that who we are and what we shall be­come is ex­trap­o­lated from the self-por­trait we cap­ture through habit, char­ac­ter and, even­tu­ally, cul­ture. And it goes with­out say­ing that that cul­ture ul­ti­mately per­vades an en­tire so­ci­ety’s psy­che. That is pre­cisely why such seem­ingly lit­tle things as dodg­ing of­fi­cial en­ter­prise daily and then unashamedly col­lect­ing pay cheques monthly, short-cuts, lit­ter­ing, and lack­ing so­cial graces and deco­rum won’t drive Africa any­where. At the cen­tre of our trans­for­ma­tion prob­lem is a wrong men­tal­ity/at­ti­tude and not poverty, the oft-touted scape­goat in this un­canny brand of thought. The Chi­nese wrapped their minds around this fact quickly enough. That is why they are in the fast lane and Africa is yet to get off the blocks. Much can be ex­tracted from China’s work ethic. It could be the stuff that sep­a­rates knaves and no­bles; that could spur Africa’s de­vel­op­ment. In 2011, South African aca­demics An­dre Slab­bert and Wil­bert I. Ukpere pub­lished a pa­per ti­tled “A Com­par­a­tive Anal­y­sis of the Chi­nese and South African Work Ethic”. Their re­search tar­geted help­ing ar­rest South Africa’s then low na­tional pro­duc­tiv­ity and rapidly el­e­vat­ing it to China’s glob­ally com­pet­i­tive level. Slab­bert and Wil­bert’s find­ings were un­sur­pris­ing. The Chi­nese work ethic proved su­pe­rior and this fed into high pro­duc­tiv­ity. The pa­per says, “Para­dox­i­cally, a num­ber of other vari­ables ex­ist which im­pact on the pro­duc­tiv­ity phe­nom­e­non, thus ren­der­ing a strict causal re­la­tion­ship be­tween work ethic and pro­duc­tiv­ity ten­u­ous in na­ture. “De­spite this, it is a recog­nised real­ity that there is a sub­stan­tive ‘neg­a­tiv­ity’ in the work ethic of the South African labour force, pos­si­bly in re­la­tion to his­tor­i­cal and cul­tural fac­tors. The Chi­nese work ethic is di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed to that of South Africa.” And there were no prizes for guess­ing the sep­a­rat­ing fac­tor be­tween the two coun­tries. It’s a fact that ap­plies to most of Africa. The pa­per con­tin­ues thus: “In dis­cus­sions with Chi­nese work­ers held in 2010, four pri­mary schools of thought emerged: a firm be­lief that hard work will bring de­sired re­sults; pride in per­sonal ac­com­plish­ments and hard work; fear of em­bar­rass­ment or shame in case of fail­ure; and im­mense pa­tri­otic pride in China and its achieve­ments. “It is the present au­thors’ con­vic­tion that none of these ap­ply to the South African labour force, and that most cer­tainly could be partly re­spon­si­ble for the eco­nomic dis­par­i­ties be­tween the two coun­tries. Hence, ad­di­tional re­search should be con­ducted to im­prove the cur­rent state of affairs.”",津巴布韦

The largely un­known com­pa­nies, to which lo­cal po­lit­i­cally con­nected elites have been linked, have ratch­eted their min­ing op­er­a­tions de­spite a Septem­ber 2020 govern­ment ban on river-bank min­ing. Some of the min­ing out­fits, how­ever, seem to have lo­cal own­er­ship. In­ves­ti­ga­tions car­ried out by The Stan­dard, work­ing in col­lab­o­ra­tion with In­for­ma­tion De­vel­op­ment Trust, a non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion sup­port­ing in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ism, es­tab­lished that Mashona­land Cen­tral and Man­i­ca­land prov­inces are par­tic­u­larly af­fected by the shady min­ing ac­tiv­i­ties. Mil­i­tary touch? “Ini­tially, the grant­ing of li­cences was done to de­silt the rivers and in the process, mine gold,” Welling­ton Takavarasha, the Zim­babwe Small-Scale Min­ers Fed­er­a­tion CEO, said. A se­nior em­ployee at one of the com­pa­nies, Tres Balla Syn­di­cate that is in­volved in stream bank min­ing along Ma­zowe River in Mashona­land Cen­tral prov­ince, name-dropped a top army of­fi­cer who he claimed was Vi­cePres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga’s brother. Chi­wenga was the Zim­babwe De­fence Forces com­man­der be­fore leav­ing the bar­racks to go into pol­i­tics fol­low­ing a mil­i­taryas­sisted re­moval of the late in­cum­bent Robert Mu­gabe from the pres­i­dency in Novem­ber 2017. Dur­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, Tres Balla was found us­ing heavy equip­ment on Ma­zowe River, an il­le­gal gold pan­ning hotspot. A man of Asian ex­trac­tion, who was only iden­ti­fied as Harry, was di­rect­ing the pro­cess­ing of gold at the site. A huge ex­ca­va­tor and tip­per were on site as wa­ter was be­ing drawn from a huge wa­ter tank perched next to a wash­ing ta­ble. Harry re­fused to com­ment on the com­pany’s op­er­a­tions, re­fer­ring ques­tions to Tadi­wanashe Jakarasi, the site man­ager who claimed that Tres Balla be­longed to Chi­wenga’s brother. “The mine is owned by Colonel Gu­vheya, the brother of Vi­cePres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga. He is called Obert Bas­tion Gu­vheya,” Jakarasi said. Vice-Pres­i­dent Chi­wenga of­fi­cially uses Gu­vheya as one of his names. Harry said Gu­vheya was in a part­ner­ship with the state-owned Zim­babwe Min­ing De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (ZMDC). But it was not im­me­di­ately clear if, in­deed, the named colonel was the real owner or a rel­a­tive of the vice-pres­i­dent, or was just be­ing bandied around for po­lit­i­cal pro­tec­tion. Com­pany doc­u­ments seen by The Stan­dard show that Tres Balla Syn­di­cate is owned by one Mike Gra­ham, an elec­tri­cal and me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer with a min­ing his­tory. Both Gra­ham and Gu­vheya could not be tracked for com­ment, but, in Zim­babwe, it is com­mon for in­vestors to use prox­ies for a range of rea­sons that in­clude dis­guis­ing one’s own iden­tity es­pe­cially where busi­ness deals are murky. Ban These rev­e­la­tions come as an In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group report pub­lished on Novem­ber 24, 2020 claimed that an un­prece­dented 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple have turned to ar­ti­sanal min­ing in Zim­babwe due to poverty wors­ened by Covid-19 and a de­te­ri­o­rat­ing econ­omy. Pro­lif­er­a­tion of gold deal­ers from coun­tries such as China and Be­larus has seen ar­ti­sanal min­ers ven­tur­ing into eco­log­i­cally sen­si­tive ar­eas such as rivers in search of overnight riches, in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed. Fol­low­ing a pub­lic outcry over moves by two Chi­nese com­pa­nies to set up coal mines in­side Hwange Na­tional Park ear­lier this year, the govern­ment on Septem­ber 8 said it had banned min­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in na­tional parks and rivers. Only two rivers — Angwa and Save — were ex­empted from the ban and govern­ment said de­sil­ta­tion would be al­lowed to con­tinue un­der strict con­di­tions. The ban, how­ever, was not ac­com­pa­nied by any new law and some min­ers are tak­ing ad­van­tage of the le­gal vac­uum to con­tinue min­ing in eco­log­i­cally frag­ile sites, river banks in­cluded.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191102,Tak­ing Africa to the next level,"IF one vis­its China to­day, they are likely to be sur­prised about the lit­tle knowl­edge that or­di­nary Chi­nese have about Africa, that is for those who know such a place ex­ists. Many of the Chi­nese, upon see­ing a black per­son on the streets are likely to shout “Meiguo”, the Chi­nese name for Amer­ica. The as­sump­tion be­ing that if you are a black per­son, then you should be a black Amer­i­can. Although Africa is known as “Feizhou” in Chi­nese, very few of them would recog­nise you as com­ing from the con­ti­nent. Through ar­range­ments on peo­ple- to- peo­ple ex­change programmes, a num­ber of Africans are now visit­ing China, mak­ing the Chi­nese get used to peo­ple com­ing from the con­ti­nent. But there are still ex­ist­ing gaps in terms of prej­u­dices that some Chi­nese hold when it comes to re­lat­ing with the Africans. It is these gaps which have in­spired Zim­bab­wean Sa­man­tha Sibanda, who lives in China, to come up with an or­gan­i­sa­tion called Ap­pre­ci­ate Africa Net­work to fight such prej­u­dices. Sa­man­tha says she is keen to cre­ate aware­ness and pro­mote the val­ues of Africa’s so­cio-cul­tural and eco­nomic con­tri­bu­tions in the world through her or­gan­i­sa­tion formed in 2013.Head­quar­tered in Bei­jing, China, Ap­pre­ci­ate Africa has also spread to the whole of the Asia Pa­cific re­gion. Sa­man­tha faced racial dis­crim­i­na­tion in class in China as she was the only black among Euro­peans, Latin Amer­i­cans and Chi­nese, which pushed her to de­sire to teach peo­ple about Africa and Africans. “The push re­ally came when one of the Pro­fes­sors who was Span­ish de­cided to show a Ma­sai man from Kenya and then told the class, ‘Imag­ine if you put this man in a car he will die of heart at­tack, but he would sur­vive if you put him in a den of Lions”, she said. To pro­mote African progress, she went to African em­bassies in Bei­jing to get posters show­ing Africa’s tourist places, min­er­als in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and col­lected a list of in­no­va­tions done in dif­fer­ent African coun­tries. As her project in col­lege, she did African aware­ness, which led to the birth of Ap­pre­ci­ate Africa Net­work. Sa­man­tha then cam­paigned and spoke against use of African peo­ple’s im­ages when de­scrib­ing poverty and other ills like HIV and Aids. “The great­est achieve­ment of all was when I wrote a pe­ti­tion to have a Chi­nese pro­vin­cial mu­seum stop an ex­hi­bi­tion showcasing Africans and liken­ing them to an­i­mals,” she said. “I met and asked them for a writ­ten apol­ogy to the African com­mu­nity all over the world. “An­other suc­cess for me was when I was se­lected as one of the Most In­flu­en­tial 100 peo­ple of African De­scent un­der 40 in 2018 and the first Zim­bab­wean to rep­re­sent Africans in China at the United Na­tions Fel­low­ship of Peo­ple of African De­scent in Geneva.” Sa­man­tha has hosted Plus Size Global Pro­gramme which seeks to make women who are big in shape feel com­fort­able with their bod­ies. Her or­gan­i­sa­tion hosts many other ac­tiv­i­ties that of­fer Africans an op­por­tu­nity to par­tic­i­pate and mar­ket their coun­tries in China. She has a “Africa Night Speech Con­test” for African stu­dents study­ing in China to talk about their coun­tries to a cos­mopoli­tan au­di­ence. The net­work also runs the Africa Got Tal­ent Show which scouts for tal­ent among Africans liv­ing in China in the fields of mu­sic, dance, poetry, drama and magic. In an ef­fort to prop up African en­trepreneurs in China, Ap­pre­ci­ate Africa Net­work runs the Africa Achiev­ers Awards, which recog­nises African com­mu­nity builders in Asia. Talk­ing of the Plus Size Global Progamme, Sa­man­tha said: “Be­ing in Asia, peo­ple think when a woman is big she is ugly, unattrac­tive and lazy, hence we pro­mote body pos­i­tiv­ity for women to love them­selves and learn how they can dress them­selves to feel beau­ti­ful and live as proud plus size women.” Sa­man­tha has also hosted Dis­cover Africa Academy that pro­vides after school programmes for in­ter­na­tional schools that ed­u­cate stu­dents about Africa. She is work­ing on stim­u­lat­ing mu­tual busi­ness in­ter­ests be­tween Zim­babwe, China and the world. “There has also been too much neg­a­tiv­ity in the press about Zim­babwe, but de­spite that, our coun­try has a lot to of­fer and the world should know how proud we are to be Zim­bab­weans,” said Sa­man­tha. She said for one to suc­ceed, they have to turn the neg­a­tives into pos­i­tives. “If you look closely at ev­ery­thing I do, it was de­rived from sit­u­a­tions that I found my­self in and I tell you there was noth­ing good about those sit­u­a­tions, but I de­cided to turn the neg­a­tives and make them pos­i­tive,” said Sa­man­tha. “I was racially dis­crim­i­nated and I started Ap­pre­ci­ate Africa Net­work and Dis­cover Africa Academy in an ef­forts to cor­rect the mind­sets of such abusers.” Sa­man­tha is an artiste in her own right, hav­ing starred in the Chi­nese film, China 1911, done in 2011. The film is about the Xin­hai Rev­o­lu­tion that ended the Qing Dy­nasty (1644 – 1911), the last im­pe­rial dy­nasty in China, lead­ing to the for­ma­tion of the Re­pub­lic of China.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210227,A Pan­golin bus bound for South Africa picks up pas­sen­gers at Mbudzi Round­about along Harare-Masvingo Road yes­ter­day de­spite a Govern­ment ban on in­ter­city and long-dis­tance bus ser­vices to cur­tail the spread of Covid-19.,"LAXITY and cor­rup­tion at po­lice check­points have seen some long-dis­tance con­ven­tional buses and com­muter om­nibuses il­le­gally op­er­at­ing in fla­grant vi­o­la­tion of Covid-19 na­tional lock­down, The Her­ald has es­tab­lished. The lock­down mea­sures, which tem­po­rar­ily banned in­ter­city travel, were in­tro­duced to curb the spread of Covid-19, but bus crews are al­legedly brib­ing po­lice of­fi­cers on the roads to gain pas­sage. On February 15 this year, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa ex­tended the na­tional lock­down Level Four by another two weeks as the coun­try seeks to en­sure that deaths from Covid-19 fur­ther come down, while giv­ing health pro­fes­sion­als time to in­ves­ti­gate and mon­i­tor the pres­ence of new vari­ants of the virus. The mea­sures in­cluded ban­ning of in­ter­city and in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel. Re­gard­less of the Pres­i­dent’s direc­tive and the statu­tory in­stru­ments bar­ring in­ter­city travel, some pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors have since re­sumed busi­ness in dis­re­gard of the reg­u­la­tions. Al­most daily, com­muter om­nibus crews ply­ing the Harare-Mu­toko High­way en­gage in a cat-and-mouse game with the po­lice along Samora Machel Av­enue, op­po­site Hol­i­day Inn. As soon as the po­lice move to other points, they cap­i­talise on their ab­sence and ferry pas­sen­gers, be­fore driv­ing off. The same is also hap­pen­ing on a daily ba­sis along the Harare-Bin­dura road, where some buses and kom­bis ferry pas­sen­gers from Harare to ar­eas like Mt Dar­win and Muzara­bani. At Mbudzi round­about along the Harare-Masvingo High­way, pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tors ferry pas­sen­gers in broad day­light, rais­ing ques­tions on the se­ri­ous­ness of of­fi­cers en­trusted with en­forc­ing the lock­down mea­sures. Once the pas­sen­gers board the buses, ex­emp­tion let­ters are not a re­quire­ment as the crews are the ones who “deal” with the po­lice at check­points. A Her­ald re­porter went un­der­cover and boarded a Gokwe-bound con­ven­tional bus owned by a lo­cal op­er­a­tor us­ing the name “Sea­sons Coaches”. The bus de­parted Harare around 11am on February 23, des­tined for Chitekete in Gokwe. This writer joined shop own­ers and ven­dors who had come to Harare to buy goods for re­sale. Sea­son Coaches picks pas­sen­gers and goods at Sto­dart Hall in Mbare and charges US$15 from Harare to Gokwe. Af­ter board­ing the bus at Harare Show­grounds bus stop, the re­porter paid the fare and was is­sued with a ticket (Num­ber 1622) in­scribed Sea­sons Coaches. The bus picked up a few other pas­sen­gers at the show­grounds illegal bus stop, in full view of po­lice of­fi­cers pa­trolling the area. Touts also swarmed the bus, bring­ing in more pas­sen­gers for a fee. The re­porter asked a mem­ber of the bus crew how some­one with­out an ex­emp­tion let­ter could be as­sisted at po­lice check­points, but he was as­sured of smooth pas­sage. “Just re­lax, no one will ask for it. Po­lice do not care about let­ters on th­ese ma­jor roads,” came the re­ply. While on the bus, most pas­sen­gers were fa­mil­iar with each other, con­firm­ing they were reg­u­lar trav­ellers who use the bus. This re­porter sat next to a mid­dle-aged wo­man des­tined for Gokwe, and a con­ver­sa­tion en­sued. Dur­ing the con­ver­sa­tion, the wo­man who iden­ti­fied her­self as Mrs Sibanda, re­vealed that she was a ven­dor and had come to Harare to buy wares for her busi­ness. “I buy and sell var­i­ous goods,” she said. “To­day, I came to buy some T-shirts and hand­bags. We al­ways come here us­ing this bus.” The bus passed the Nor­ton check­point with­out any glitches, and stopped about 50 me­tres away to ferry more pas­sen­gers. Just af­ter the Kwekwe road­block near Truck Inn, the bus stopped and those go­ing to Gweru and Bu­l­awayo were told to dis­em­bark. A Toy­ota Wish was wait­ing to ferry them to their fi­nal des­ti­na­tions. The bus made a U-turn be­fore it passed through the same road­block and turned left head­ing for Gokwe. At a road­block just be­fore Zhombe Busi­ness Cen­tre, the bus was stopped by the po­lice and a co-driver dis­em­barked, and briefly talked to a po­lice of­fi­cer. He handed the of­fi­cer some money in full glare of the pas­sen­gers, but the re­porter could not es­tab­lish the amount. At Bomba Shop­ping Cen­tre, some 20km be­fore Gokwe Cen­tre, all the pas­sen­gers were or­dered to dis­em­bark af­ter the bus crew got in­for­ma­tion that the only team of of­fi­cers who had re­sisted bribes and ar­rested them the pre­vi­ous week were mount­ing a road­block near Gokwe Cen­tre. Fur­ther en­quiries by the re­porter re­vealed that there were “un­friendly” and strict of­fi­cers at a check­point be­fore Gokwe Cen­tre, hence the bus crew feared ar­rest. Zim­babwe Pas­sen­ger Trans­port Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ZPTO) chair­per­son Mr Sam­son Nhan­hanga con­demned those op­er­at­ing dur­ing the lock­down. “As an as­so­ci­a­tion, we do sup­port that Govern­ment was clear when it or­dered us to stop op­er­at­ing,” he said. “All our mem­bers are com­ply­ing with the lock­down (reg­u­la­tions) and if you see any­one dis­re­gard­ing Covid-19 mea­sures, he or she is not af­fil­i­ated with us. “All bus op­er­a­tors must com­ply with the law. If Govern­ment says stop, then we must lis­ten. When it opens up the routes for us, we will then re­sume op­er­a­tions.” On February 25 in the evening, the re­porter boarded a Toy­ota Hi­ace com­muter om­nibus from Gokwe to Em­press shop­ping cen­tre on the re­turn jour­ney. The re­porter could not find trans­port un­til 1:45am when the Nis­san Car­a­van com­muter om­nibus ply­ing the Em­press-Harare route ar­rived. It was al­most half full when the re­porter jumped in and was charged US$10 to Harare. Un­like the Sea­son Coaches bus crew, the Nis­san Car­a­van crew are ex­perts in evad­ing road­blocks. Where there was a road­block, the crew would use al­ter­na­tive roads to avoid the po­lice. But the Nor­ton road­block was not easy to evade. Po­lice stopped the crew around 4am yes­ter­day and the driver quickly dis­em­barked, while hold­ing a US$10 note that he handed over to a po­lice of­fi­cer. The com­muter om­nibus was al­lowed to pass. Most of the pas­sen­gers were ven­dors from Em­press busi­ness cen­tre com­ing to Harare to buy their wares for re­sale. The Nis­san Car­a­van ar­rived in Mbare around 5am and en­tered the gate at House Num­ber 3291, 4th Street. All pas­sen­gers dis­em­barked and the kombi crew ad­vised the pas­sen­gers that the same kombi would leave Mbare back to Em­press in the evening. No sani­ti­sa­tion was done on the con­ven­tional bus to Gokwe and the com­muter om­nibus back to Harare. A hand­ful of pas­sen­gers were putting on masks, with a few wear­ing them cor­rectly. Na­tional po­lice spokesper­son As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Paul Ny­athi said they were con­duct­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the mat­ter. “Po­lice are con­duct­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions into this mat­ter,” he said. “We will give you a de­tailed re­sponse once we are done with our in­ves­ti­ga­tions.” Re­cently, po­lice warned the pub­lic against vi­o­lat­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions and urged com­pli­ance with the reg­u­la­tions in place. Un­be­known to him, his wives had con­nived to take con­tra­cep­tives and each had a place in her gar­den where the com­mu­nity health worker went and dropped the pills. It was nor­mally un­der a stone by the corner pole of the gar­den. The women had got­ten tired of work­ing for the children. Madz­ibaba Joha never worked ex­cept in the bed­room. Each wife was sup­posed to fend for her fam­ily. The deal was sys­tem­atic, the wives took con­tra­cep­tives at sunset ev­ery day, hence they would go to the gar­den ev­ery sunset with­out fail BACK in the vil­lage in the prover­bial land of milk, honey and dust, or Gu­ruve, good for­tune has its own con­se­quences: if you have five wives you have five tongues and five brains to deal with. In as much as you have a buf­fet of love, at times it morphs into a cock­tail of prob­lems. Dur­ing the last Christmas hol­i­day, this vil­lager, the son of a peas­ant, vis­ited a cousin, a mem­ber of the Jo­hanne Marange Apos­tolic sect and hey, he has quite a job sat­is­fy­ing the needs of his five wives, I mean in virtually ev­ery­thing. Madz­ibaba Joha, as he is af­fec­tion­ately known in the vil­lage, has at the age of 40 fa­thered 34 children with his five wives and, ac­cord­ing to him, the sky is the limit. God will­ing, he could fa­ther more children with the same women or God will­ing, he could still marry more wives from the church. Madz­ibaba Joha is wor­ried that in the past year or so, none of his wives has fallen preg­nant, yet ac­cord­ing to church doc­trine, none of them uses con­tra­cep­tives. He has tried prayer af­ter prayer, but the women keep on telling him to try harder. Pray harder. Try harder. Harder, harder, harder and harder! Harder! Harder in bed! He has changed an­tics and styles, but to no avail. In such oc­ca­sions, even the best cook­ing pot does not pro­duce food, do they not say that in the vil­lage? But you see, in the vil­lage poverty un­der­stands and com­plies with the game of num­bers. Poverty is a good math­e­ma­ti­cian, when it counts more stom­achs, it re­duces the earn­ings and then, you be­come syn­ony­mous with a dearth of sup­plies. Dear reader, this vil­lager will go back to the rea­son why Madz­ibaba Joha is now “fir­ing blanks”, yet church doc­trine says re­pro­duce and be as many as the grains of sand. Madz­ibaba Joha’s homestead is built a spit­ting dis­tance from Dande River. A foot­path leads to the river. Here Dande River flows gen­tly, over gleam­ing stones pol­ished smooth over the ages by run­ning wa­ter. Dande never dries up on this stretch and thick­ets of trees on the banks ac­com­pany wa­ter fur­ther down un­til it emp­ties its con­tents into a silty sand swamp at its con­flu­ence with Manyame River, near Mushumbi Pools. The river gives life to the whole vil­lage. An in­tri­cate net­work of foot­paths from var­i­ous home­steads con­verges on the river­banks like arms of an oc­to­pus. Like a Catholic fa­ther con­fes­sor, Dande River has lis­tened to many quar­rels, be­tween wash­ing and bathing women, good and bad gos­sip, news and scan­dals. It has wit­nessed bud­ding ro­mances be­come mar­riages and wed­dings. It has seen many things, but re­mained mum. It keeps se­crets. The veg­etable gar­dens on its banks are another source of life. They have their own sto­ries too. Dande never tells those sto­ries. Madz­ibaba Joha’s homestead is a vil­lage on its own. It con­sists of a large grass-thatched main house, around which are sev­eral such sim­i­lar huts. On the kitchens, the grass used for thatch­ing is now dark brown with age, the weather and soot from the fires lit in­side, for cook­ing, light and warmth. The huts have char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally low-hang­ing roofs with eaves that al­most ob­scure the door­ways. The walls are dec­o­rated with chalk and each writ­ten scorn­ful mes­sages, typical of a polyg­a­mous set up. The names of his children also tell sto­ries. Real life sto­ries from af­fec­tion, con­quest up to dis­gruntle­ment. The smaller huts tend to re­cede to­wards the edge of the perime­ter fence, giv­ing each wife and his children space, the much-needed space. Madz­ibaba Joha and this vil­lager sat by the shed, talk­ing fam­ily mat­ters and men’s is­sues and were soon joined by a boy who had just teth­ered their goats and penned up their cat­tle. One af­ter the other the wives brought food and the more than 10 boys sat around and set upon each plate as it came. This vil­lager noted with amuse­ment that the boys fell for each plate of food like mag­gots and made the food dis­ap­pear as soon as it ar­rived. It was akin to moths be­ing at­tracted by light. Madz­ibaba Joha and this vil­lager pro­ceeded to eat slowly and care­fully, mak­ing sure we ate from each plate, throw­ing some of the food into the children’s plate and feed­ing the dogs at the same time — to make sure each wife’s plate went back to the kitchen empty. It is the badly cooked or the taste­less that was given to the boys and a neigh­bour’s dogs. It is the one with­out meat as rel­ish that was rel­e­gated to the boys and the dogs. Madz­ibaba Joha knew each of his wives and how they cooked! At times, he never al­lowed the food from the bad cook­ers to be tasted by this vil­lager. “This one is cer­tainly for the dogs. You won’t like it. She just can­not cook. She is like that ev­ery day. She boils and boils and never goes fur­ther to fry or spice like oth­ers. “This wo­man!’’ he mum­bled to make sure it was in­audi­ble to the children around. One good thing about Madz­ibaba Joha, this vil­lager no­ticed, each wife would think her food was eaten. It has kept the huge fam­ily at great peace. Madz­ibaba Joha spoke of the tac­tic of keep­ing fam­ily unity and how he has man­aged to do that. Sure, his big fam­ily is peace­ful when com­pared to even some monog­a­mous mar­riages. Wis­dom has been a part of him, but when it comes to his wives not con­ceiv­ing any­more, that seems to have eluded him. We later re­tired for the night, with­out in­ci­dent. The wife on duty came to pick him up for a bath, dis­turb­ing our deep talk about him no longer im­preg­nat­ing his wives. The fol­low­ing day, at about mid-morn­ing as the sun rose im­per­cep­ti­bly from the east, one by one his wives dis­ap­peared to the river. There they would wa­ter their gar­dens, but there was some­thing spe­cial there. On the par­tic­u­lar day, a wo­man, a vil­lage health worker, rode past on her bi­cy­cle and waved her hand, but never stopped. “You see that wo­man, she pro­vides con­tra­cep­tive for free to women in the vil­lage but does not stop by my home be­cause we are mem­bers of the church and my wives do not take con­tra­cep­tion. Ac­tu­ally, my wives do not even talk to her be­cause they know she is evil. It is evil to take con­tra­cep­tives. “It is killing, ac­tu­ally it is mur­der,’’ he nar­rated. Un­be­known to him, his wives had con­nived to take con­tra­cep­tives and each had a place in her gar­den where the com­mu­nity health worker went and dropped the pills. It was nor­mally un­der a stone by the corner pole of the gar­den. The women had got­ten tired of work­ing for the children. Madz­ibaba Joha never worked ex­cept in the bed­room. Each wife was sup­posed to fend for her fam­ily. The deal was sys­tem­atic, the wives took con­tra­cep­tives at sunset ev­ery day, hence they would go to the gar­den ev­ery sunset with­out fail. Mean­while, Madz­ibaba Joha laboured in bed, ex­pect­ing to drop one or two more children. No one told him. He suf­fered and nei­ther did the church prophets get the trick. The vil­lage sooth­sayer, the age­less au­tochthon of knowl­edge and wis­dom says “the day money is des­tined to die, it finds all trees slip­pery. “Where ze­bras hud­dle to­gether, the lion lies down hun­gry.’’ Women are a clever lot. The vil­lage never ceases to amaze me. Each visit has its in­ter­est­ing story to tell. The Dan­der River re­mains quiet. It shall not speak. SKILLS de­vel­op­ment is at­tract­ing height­ened in­ter­est in many coun­tries, and Zim­babwe is no ex­cep­tion. Hu­man cap­i­tal de­vel­op­ment is an in­dis­pens­able as­pect in the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion agenda of our coun­try. The process of de­vel­op­ing the re­quired hu­man cap­i­tal should be in­formed by ex­ist­ing and fore­cast crit­i­cal skills that drive key eco­nomic sec­tors. For our na­tion to at­tain the vi­sion of a mid­dle-in­come econ­omy by 2030, there is a need for a holis­tic skills de­vel­op­ment plan aimed at em­pow­er­ing our work­force with the nec­es­sary skills and knowl­edge to at­tain that goal. Our coun­try’s great­est as­set is its peo­ple, who are renowned for their hard work and un­quench­able zeal for ed­u­ca­tion. An or­gan­ised sys­tem of skills de­vel­op­ment will en­able Zim­bab­weans to have the op­por­tu­nity to master new skills, con­trib­ute their full tal­ents to our econ­omy, and be re­warded for it. Zim­babwe is in­creas­ingly recog­nis­ing that a well-de­fined na­tional skills de­vel­op­ment pol­icy is vi­tal for sus­tain­able and bal­anced growth. Most im­por­tantly, it pro­vides di­rec­tion and fo­cus to the skills sys­tem. By im­ple­ment­ing a na­tional skills pol­icy, a coun­try can, among oth­ers, bring co­her­ence to the sys­tem, fa­cil­i­tate co­or­di­nated re­forms, and clar­ify in­sti­tu­tional ar­range­ments. The Zim­bab­wean ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem is revered around the world. Ed­u­ca­tion in ev­ery sense is one of the fun­da­men­tal fac­tors of de­vel­op­ment, be­cause it raises peo­ple’s pro­duc­tiv­ity and cre­ativ­ity, pro­motes en­trepreneur­ship and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances. In ad­di­tion, it plays a cru­cial role in se­cur­ing eco­nomic and so­cial progress as well as im­prov­ing in­come dis­tri­bu­tion. Uni­ver­si­ties and col­leges must align their cur­ric­ula with cor­po­rates’ needs. We can­not con­tinue to send stu­dents to in­sti­tu­tions that can­not pro­duce mar­ket ex­pected out­comes. Pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions are the ma­jor cul­prits as they are in more for the money than ed­u­ca­tional pur­poses. Cre­at­ing a re-skilling rev­o­lu­tion in Zim­babwe will re­quire in­vest­ment, and this should not be left to the Govern­ment alone. There is a need for busi­ness col­lab­o­ra­tion, Govern­ment in­vest­ment and pub­lic-pri­vate col­lab­o­ra­tion to lower costs and achieve ex­pected out­comes. In or­der to at­tain the mid­dle or higher-in­come status as a coun­try, we must pro­duce the higher value added, higher qual­ity goods and ser­vices that can yield higher wages and prof­its. To do that we need a skilled work­force and an ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing sys­tem that ad­e­quately pre­pares young peo­ple to en­ter the labour mar­ket. This im­per­a­tive runs along­side cur­rent re­think­ing on the pat­tern of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, which seeks, not only rapid, but in­clu­sive growth. The Govern­ment of the Re­pub­lic of Zim­babwe is con­cerned about and com­mit­ted to achiev­ing so­cial eq­uity, so­cial in­clu­sion, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and peace. The pol­icy frame­work that grows out of this in­creased in­ter­est in skills de­vel­op­ment as an im­por­tant means of ad­dress­ing eco­nomic, so­cial and de­vel­op­men­tal con­cerns is firmly rooted in the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1. There is a case for Zim­babwe to in­te­grate skills de­vel­op­ment in na­tional eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment strate­gies The NDS1 has made it clear that to en­gen­der ac­cel­er­ated growth in the econ­omy, the de­mand for skilled man­power in the coun­try be­comes im­per­a­tive. Zim­babwe has a young pop­u­la­tion, and we must har­ness this “de­mo­graphic div­i­dend” with a co­or­di­nated and stream­lined skills de­vel­op­ment process. Why skills de­vel­op­ment plan? The ar­gu­ments for for­mu­lat­ing a na­tional skills de­vel­op­ment pol­icy, as op­posed to merely im­prov­ing pro­grammes of skills de­vel­op­ment are com­pelling. A well for­mu­lated skills de­vel­op­ment plan will bring co­her­ence to the sys­tem. A na­tional pol­icy pre­sents a com­mon vi­sion of the skills sys­tem that a coun­try is aim­ing to build, and fa­cil­i­tate co­or­di­nated and planned ac­tions and re­forms. The pol­icy dis­sem­i­nates a set of re­quired changes to be pur­sued in or­der to achieve the vi­sion of the skills sys­tem in a co­or­di­nated man­ner. A na­tional pol­icy is con­ducive to a more holis­tic re­sponse to hu­man re­sources plan­ning that draws to­gether the var­i­ous Govern­ment agen­cies and providers of ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing. Any model to be suc­cess­ful needs a lot of sup­port from stake­hold­ers too. In the ab­sence of a buy-in from the cor­po­rate sector the progress of such ini­tia­tives is re­duced. Skills de­vel­op­ment has been a pri­or­ity of the Govern­ment of Zim­babwe, and this is demon­strated by the em­pha­sis placed in the NDS1. Skills de­vel­op­ment is key to the eco­nomic growth of the coun­try. It needs a co­or­di­nated ef­fort from all agen­cies, stake­hold­ers and stu­dents to make it suc­cess­ful. Covid-19 and new skills set Another skill that will be es­sen­tial as our global econ­omy re­builds from the dam­age done by Covid-19 is crit­i­cal think­ing. Dur­ing the pan­demic, we have seen a spike in fake news and mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions of data and stud­ies, as lead­ers, busi­nesses, and gov­ern­ments are try­ing to shift blame and di­vert at­ten­tion and proper scru­tiny. Those who can ob­jec­tively eval­u­ate in­for­ma­tion from di­verse sources to de­ter­mine what is cred­i­ble will be val­ued. Not all in­for­ma­tion should be trusted. Or­gan­i­sa­tions will need to rely on crit­i­cal think­ing to un­der­stand what in­for­ma­tion should in­form de­ci­sion-mak­ing. One of the changes in a world that is heav­ily aug­mented by the sup­port of ma­chines and where so­cial phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing and home-work­ing might con­tinue for the fore­see­able fu­ture, is that more peo­ple at all lev­els of an or­gan­i­sa­tion will be in a po­si­tion to lead oth­ers. The gig econ­omy is only go­ing to grow post-coro­n­avirus, and peo­ple will be work­ing in more flu­ent teams where they will be tak­ing the lead at dif­fer­ent times. Pro­fes­sion­als with strong skills in lead­er­ship, in­clud­ing how to bring out the best and in­spire teams as well as en­cour­age col­lab­o­ra­tion, will be in de­mand. Data is a crit­i­cal as­set for ev­ery com­pany. With the right data, com­pa­nies are able to bet­ter pre­dict the im­pact of fu­ture busi­ness dis­rup­tions. They are bet­ter able to serve cus­tomers with the right prod­ucts and ser­vices dur­ing or af­ter any pan­demic. Com­pa­nies that un­der­stand busi­ness trends and shifting cus­tomer needs are bet­ter able to re­spond in the right way should a fu­ture pan­demic come along. How­ever, the data is use­less to a com­pany, un­less there is data lit­er­ate-peo­ple equipped with skills to un­der­stand it, and make bet­ter de­ci­sions be­cause of it. Pro­fes­sion­als with data lit­er­acy will be even more ap­peal­ing to prospec­tive em­ploy­ers than ever be­fore. Chal­lenges The coun­try has a huge re­spon­si­bil­ity to tran­si­tion with its cor­po­rates for mean­ing­ful col­lab­o­ra­tion that will pri­ori­tise skills de­vel­op­ment and re-skilling em­ploy­ees af­fected by the fast-chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment. We must in­stil an attitude of ex­cel­lence and pas­sion for work as that will add value to pro­duc­tiv­ity-driven Zim­babwe. Skills ob­tained through train­ing and those re­quired by the job of­ten do not match, re­sult­ing in skills short­ages in some ar­eas, and si­mul­ta­ne­ously, a sur­plus of work­ers with skills that are not in de­mand, con­tribut­ing to un­em­ploy­ment. Also, there is lim­ited in­volve­ment of so­cial part­ners. There is a per­ceived lack of ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion of em­ploy­ers’ and work­ers’ or­gan­i­sa­tions which is es­sen­tial to en­sure the pro­vi­sion of rel­e­vant and ap­pro­pri­ate train­ing. Weak qual­ity as­sur­ance, too few or poorly qual­i­fied train­ers, poor work­ing con­di­tions for train­ers, and out­dated qual­i­fi­ca­tions, cur­ric­ula, train­ing ma­te­ri­als and meth­ods all in­hibit the qual­ity of train­ing. Lim­ited labour mar­ket in­for­ma­tion and in­abil­ity to trans­late such in­for­ma­tion into im­proved train­ing un­der­mines rel­e­vance. The other issue is lim­ited ac­cess to train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. Women and dis­ad­van­taged groups of­ten face ad­di­tional bar­ri­ers in ac­cess­ing train­ing. We also need to har­ness the sprawl­ing in­for­mal sector and how such skills can also be de­vel­oped. There may be a weak co­or­di­na­tion in the sys­tem as well. A large num­ber of ac­tors and providers (min­istries, agen­cies, cen­tral and re­gional gov­ern­ments, none-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, em­ploy­ers and work­ers) are in­volved in skills de­vel­op­ment. Their ef­forts of­ten over­lap and are not well co­or­di­nated, es­pe­cially in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Weak­ness in link­ing skills sup­ply and de­mand also lim­its pos­i­tive im­pact on em­ploy­ment and pro­duc­tiv­ity. Mea­sures for ef­fec­tive im­ple­men­ta­tion Zim­babwe has a na­tional skills de­vel­op­ment pol­icy in place, but the cru­cial ques­tion is: what are the key mea­sures to en­sure ef­fec­tive im­ple­men­ta­tion? How­ever com­pre­hen­sive and good it may be, a pol­icy is only as good as its im­ple­men­ta­tion. Ex­pe­ri­ence sug­gests that the fol­low­ing el­e­ments are es­sen­tial to ef­fec­tive pol­icy im­ple­men­ta­tion: set­ting achieve­ment tar­gets and milestones within a fixed time­frame; iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of a lead agency, or min­istry, for im­ple­men­ta­tion with clearly de­fined re­spon­si­bil­i­ties; clear im­ple­men­ta­tion plans at mul­ti­ple lev­els (e.g. na­tional, state/prov­ince and in­sti­tu­tional); as­sess­ment and, if nec­es­sary, im­prove­ment of the fit be­tween ex­ist­ing in­sti­tu­tions and man­dates and the pol­icy, and, if ap­pli­ca­ble, their ca­pac­ity build­ing in im­ple­ment­ing the pol­icy; iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of a key in­sti­tu­tion for mon­i­tor­ing progress; al­lo­ca­tion of ad­e­quate bud­getary and other re­sources, and a plan for re­source mo­bil­i­sa­tion; in­sti­tu­tion­al­i­sa­tion of mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion mech­a­nisms; and sus­tained po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment and lead­er­ship. Mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion mech­a­nisms Mon­i­tor­ing and eval­u­a­tion en­ables pol­icy im­ple­men­ta­tion and the im­pact of the pol­icy to be ob­jec­tively as­sessed. To this end, the pol­icy should in­clude pro­vi­sion for mid-term re­view, fi­nal re­view, and an im­pact as­sess­ment (nor­mally a few years af­ter the fi­nal year of the pol­icy) to cap­ture long-term ef­fects. South Africa adopted a model of us­ing nu­mer­i­cal in­di­ca­tors to mon­i­tor progress and achieve­ments. South Africa is unique in its strong fo­cus on re­dress­ing racial in­equal­ity in ac­cess­ing and ob­tain­ing skills. Zim­babwe could also learn from South Africa’s ex­pe­ri­ences on this use of quan­ti­ta­tive mea­sures. Ex­am­ples of the pro­posed in­di­ca­tors are: progress on pro­mot­ing eq­uity (on the ba­sis of class, race, gen­der, age, dis­abil­ity and HIV/AIDS status); broad tar­gets of num­bers to be trained by oc­cu­pa­tional level; pro­por­tion of young learn­ers and the em­ployed to be trained. In ad­di­tion, spe­cific tar­gets are to be set for large, medium and small firms in de­vel­op­ing and sub­mit­ting work­force skills plans. Vo­ca­tional train­ing pro­grammes should be in­cluded at pri­mary and sec­ondary school level. This model has been suc­cess­fully im­ple­mented in China. Pub­lic pri­vate part­ner­ships play a key role in the de­vel­op­ment and en­hance­ment of skills. It is im­por­tant to recog­nise the chang­ing na­ture of work in what is be­com­ing a global knowl­edge econ­omy, within which Zim­bab­wean en­ter­prises are op­er­at­ing. The ex­tent to which em­ploy­ers and work­ers ben­e­fit from the knowl­edge econ­omy will be de­ter­mined by our ca­pac­ity to con­duct in­no­va­tive re­search and ap­ply new knowl­edge in the work­place. This re­quires the de­vel­op­ment of re­search ca­pac­ity, par­tic­u­larly re­search re­lated to build­ing new knowl­edge linked to sector and na­tional in­dus­trial plans. For our coun­try to achieve high lev­els of eco­nomic growth and ad­dress so­cial chal­lenges of poverty and in­equal­ity, we must work to­gether to in­vest in train­ing and skills de­vel­op­ment. This will en­able us to achieve our vi­sion of a skilled and ca­pa­ble work­force to sup­port an in­clu­sive growth path in line with the tar­gets of NDS1. The key driv­ing force of a na­tional skills plan is im­prov­ing the ef­fec­tive­ness and ef­fi­ciency of de­vel­op­ment sys­tems. The NDS1 em­pha­sizes skills de­vel­op­ment, which rep­re­sents an ex­plicit com­mit­ment by the Govern­ment of Zim­babwe to en­cour­age the link­ing of skills growth to ca­reer paths, thus pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able em­ploy­ment and in-work pro­gres­sion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20161218,‘Peo­ple don’t eat democ­racy’,"LACK of pol­icy co-or­di­na­tion, po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity in the name of “democ­racy” and poor le­gal frame­works are sti­fling Africa’s de­vel­op­ment and ham­per­ing the con­ti­nent’s part­ner­ship with China, a se­nior of­fi­cial in Bei­jing has said. The Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral of the De­part­ment of African Af­fairs at the Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry, Am­bas­sador Lin Song­tian, said this in an ad­dress to del­e­gates rep­re­sent­ing civil so­ci­ety at a re­cent work­shop in Bei­jing. Am­bas­sador Lin said while China would never tell Africa what ide­o­log­i­cal po­lit­i­cal model to fol­low, bitter ex­pe­ri­ence had shown that “peo­ple don’t eat democ­racy”. He said three decades of the Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus had not de­liv­ered de­vel­op­ment, but, on the other hand, the Chi­nese model had lifted hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty in a shorter space of time. The Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus refers to a set of eco­nomic pol­icy pre­scrip­tions pro­moted pri­mar­ily by the United States govern­ment and the IMF and World Bank. The pre­scrip­tions re­late to mar­ket-led eco­nomic growth/ mar­ket fun­da­menta l ism (neo-lib­er­al­ism), free trade and re­duced state par­tic­i­pa­tion in the macro-economy. On the other hand, the Bei­jing Con­sen­sus — ac­cord­ing to for­mer Chi­nese govern­ment of­fi­cial Mr Zhang Wei­wei — is re­lated to down-to-earth prag­matic con­cern with serv­ing the peo­ple; con­stant ex­per­i­men­ta­tion/in­no­va­tion; grad­ual re­form as op­posed to neo-lib­eral shock ther­apy; a strong de­vel­op­men­tal state; se­lec­tive adop­tion of ap­pro­pri­ate for­eign ideas; and tack­ling easy re­forms first and the more dif­fi­cult ones later. It is within this con­text that Am­bas­sador Lin told African civil so­ci­ety del­e­gates re­cently to prop­erly ad­vise and part­ner gov­ern­ments by con­tribut­ing ideas and sup­port that fur­thered tan­gi­ble de­vel­op­ment ob­jec­tives. Am­bas­sador Lin is also the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of China’s Fol­low-Up Com­mit­tee for the Forum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Fo­cac). The work­shop was or­gan­ised and hosted by the deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the China Net­work for NGO Ex­changes, Mr Shi Gouhui. “Twenty-thirty years of the Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus have not brought food and jobs. . .The Bei­jing Con­sen­sus is very sim­ple: we are part­ners; we never force ideas, we want durable peace,” Am­bas­sador Lin said. “I was am­bas­sador to Malawi and Liberia some time ago. (When I was there) some peo­ple were say­ing China was not com­mit­ted to democ­racy and hu­man rights. “The Bri­tish had been in Malawi for 100 years be­fore China, but the peo­ple had no par­lia­ment (build­ing). I said we can’t dis­cuss democ­racy un­der a tree, and in a year we built a par­lia­ment. “Hu­man rights are the right to work, the right to eat, the right to health. We are cre­at­ing jobs which feed peo­ple, which ed­u­cate them and which pro­vide health­care for them. Western coun­tries want democ­racy that means go to the streets and demon­strate — but that’s your choice!” He gave the ex­am­ple of Zim­babwe, which he said be­fore land re­forms was held by the West as an ex­am­ple of democ­racy. “Be­fore Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe gave land to the ma­jor­ity he was a pi­o­neer of democ­racy. He was even recog­nised by the (Bri­tish) queen. ‘‘ Then sud­denly there were sanc­tions. Six months af­ter sanc­tions, the su­per­mar­kets were empty. “Is that democ­racy? Peo­ple are suf­fer­ing a lot in the name of democ­racy and hu­man rights. Let me be clear: we hate dic­ta­tor­ships and we love democ­racy — democ­racy the Chi­nese way. “Pur­sue a sys­tem that ben­e­fits the peo­ple. Look at the Arab Spring, now peo­ple are start­ing to un­der­stand Western democ­racy bet­ter. . .If it is good for the peo­ple and gives long-term sta­bil­ity, then it’s good. The out­come is all that matters and that is what so­cial­ism is all about.” Am­bas­sador Lin said as far as the West was con­cerned, a bad govern­ment was bet­ter than a sta­ble, last­ing regime; and Africa must deal with its fre­quent ad­min­is­tra­tive changes if it was to de­velop. “Malawi has 30 po­lit­i­cal par­ties, so the coun­try is pulling in 30 dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions. The DRC has more than 400 po­lit­i­cal par­ties. Why so many par­ties all in the name of democ­racy? “They (the West) want divi­sion; they can then in­ter­fere, even mil­i­tar­ily. They weaken lead­er­ship all in the name of democ­racy. . . “Democ­racy is good, but Western democ­racy has robbed Africa; it hasn’t found so­lu­tions to jobs and food. Peo­ple don’t eat democ­racy. For us there is only one en­emy, and that is poverty.” Am­bas­sador Lin said these di­vi­sions in the name of democ­racy meant pol­icy in­con­sis­tency, which worked against sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and eroded the strength of bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral part­ner­ships. “Fre­quent power shifts mean that na­tional pol­icy isn’t con­sis­tent. China ad­vises its in­vestors to tar­get African coun­tries where there are strong, sta­ble rul­ing par­ties. In­vestors need ca­pa­ble and sta­ble lead­er­ship.” He said where the sta­bil­ity pre­con­di­tion was met, there was also need to en­sure laws and reg­u­la­tions that pro­moted mu­tu­ally-ben­e­fi­cial in­vest­ment and trade. “Africa needs to im­prove the in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment. Many African coun­tries were more fa­mil­iar with aid and not in­vest­ment. Busi­ness is busi­ness, where there is no re­turn there will be no in­vest­ment. . . “An in­vestor is like a fly­ing bird. It looks for some­where safe to land, some­where with food and where it will be com­fort­able. Laws and reg­u­la­tions pro­vide that safety. “China is un­der the Com­mu­nist Party of China but Euro­pean and Amer­i­can in­vestors are flock­ing here for long-term in­vest­ment. They know they will make a profit. Profit comes from in­cen­tive poli­cies and ser­vices that en­sure in­vestors are com­fort­able. There is need to up­date African laws to meet mod­ern de­mands.” He gave the ex­am­ple of estab­lish­ment of spe­cial eco­nomic zones as a good cat­a­lyst for in­vest­ment that led to de­vel­op­ment; em­pha­sis­ing the at­trac­tive­ness of good laws, con­ces­sion­ary poli­cies and ser­vices.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170504,"In­vest in agri­cul­ture, Africa urged","AFRICAN gov­ern­ments should in­vest in agri­cul­ture, giving par­tic­u­lar at­ten­tion to the small scale farm­ers on whom the sec­tor and the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion are premised. Speaking dur­ing a de­bate here yes­ter­day on lead­er­ship in an era of dis­rup­tion, Ox­fam In­ter­na­tional Ex­ec­u­tive Di­rec­tor Win­nie Byany­ima said it was crit­i­cal for gov­ern­ments and the pri­vate sec­tor to in­vest in ir­ri­ga­tion equip­ment, in­fra­struc­ture such as dam and roads, and the avail­abil­ity of fi­nance fa­cil­i­ties to en­sure that the sec­tor reaches its po­ten­tial. Agri­cul­ture cre­ates at least 60 per­cent of Africa’s rev­enue while it en­sures food se­cu­rity. “In­vest­ment in agri­cul­ture can re­duce poverty five times more than any other eco­nomic sec­tor. So put resources into this sec­tor and stop peo­ple from dy­ing,” she said. Al­though the sec­tor was threat­ened by cli­mate change, it was crit­i­cal that mea­sures be put in place to con­front such chal­lenges as droughts. The con­ti­nent needed to put in place mea­sures to adapt to the changes tak­ing place in the sec­tor while also em­brac­ing new tech­nol­ogy. The session, the first ple­nary of WEF 2017, was mod­er­ated by Zim­bab­wean Vim­bai Ka­jese, a TV per­son­al­ity and en­tre­pre­neur based in China. She raised Zim­babwe’s flag high. Nige­ria’s Tony Ofumelu stressed the im­por­tance of vi­able agri­cul­ture as a strat­egy to erad­i­cate poverty. “How can you talk of de­vel­op­ment when you cant feed your­self?” We need to en­sure food se­cu­rity through in­vest­ment,” he said. Mr Ofumelu lamented the fact that mea­sures were adopted even at African Union level to bol­ster agri­cul­ture and other sec­tors of the econ­omy but many of these were hardly im­ple­mented. “In Africa the nar­ra­tive should change. Africa should call on all its lead­ers to im­prove the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment . . . to deal with poverty. The peo­ple who grow economies are SMEs,” he said. Agri­cul­ture also has the high­est po­ten­tial to create job and to re­duce the ru­ral to ur­ban mi­gra­tion that has crested more chal­lenges for most of the con­ti­nent’s cities. There­fore, in­vest­ing in agri­cul­ture would help re­duce poverty while re­duc­ing the ef­fects of cli­mate change. Most economies on the con­ti­nent are an­chored on Agri­cul­ture. Zim­babwe is one coun­try that has em­barked on an ag­gres­sive pro­gramme to re­source agri­cul­ture through the Com­mand Agri­cul­ture project lately. The land re­dis­tri­bu­tion pro­gramme was also an ini­tia­tive to en­sure Zim­babwe had ac­cess to land, one of the crit­i­cal fac­tors of pro­duc­tion.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200601,"Cor­rup­tion, not sanc­tions, crum­bling Zim","ZIM­BABWE has been grap­pling with cor­rup­tion for years now, dat­ing back to the time of the Wil­low­gate scan­dal, Grain Mar­ket­ing Board saga in which the late for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter Kumbi­rai Kan­gai was in­volved. In 1994, War Vic­tims Com­pen­sa­tion scan­dal; 1999 Na­tional Oil Com­pany of Zim­babwe scan­dal; 2016 Com­mand Agri­cul­ture scan­dal and 2018, Zesa scan­dal in­volv­ing Sa­muel Un­denge, just to men­tion a few. Zim­babwe ranks joint 160th out of 180 coun­tries in the 2016 Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional Cor­rup­tion Per­cep­tions In­dex. From the time the Zim­babwe Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion was formed, not even a sin­gle of­fi­cial was ar­rested, let alone tried. The late for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe used to talk about cor­rup­tion, but failed to take it head-on. Just like we see in this so-called sec­ond repub­lic to­day. Cor­rup­tion ex­ists in ev­ery coun­try and un­der­mines so­cial jus­tice in many. It di­verts pub­lic funds meant for de­vel­op­ment to rich elites, raids re­sources in­tended for poverty re­duc­tion and dis­torts the econ­omy, with the big­gest im­pact felt by the poor­est peo­ple in so­ci­ety. We have not been spared from this sce­nario. Ac­cord­ing to most economists, the root cause of cor­rup­tion lies in the del­e­ga­tion of power. It is the dis­cre­tionary use of that power and the of­ten mo­nop­o­lis­tic po­si­tion pub­lic of­fi­cials en­joy when deal­ing with con­tacts, which make cor­rup­tion pos­si­ble. The in­cen­tives and op­por­tu­ni­ties for cor­rup­tion de­pend on the size of the rents, or the per­sonal prof­its, which pub­lic agents can de­rive from al­lo­cat­ing con­tracts. I have seen these deal­ings in dif­fer­ent in­sti­tu­tions, from churches to govern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions. Cor­rup­tion, there­fore, oc­curs at point where po­lit­i­cal, bu­reau­cratic and eco­nomic in­ter­ests co­in­cide. There is also leg­isla­tive cor­rup­tion when politi­cians be­tray the elec­torate by sell­ing their votes to pres­sure groups and do­nat­ing goods and food do­nated by China or other coun­tries. An­other act of cor­rup­tion which we have wit­nessed in the coun­try was the abuse of the Zim­babwe Man­power De­vel­op­ment Fund money meant for skills de­vel­op­ment which was al­legedly di­verted by for­mer min­is­ter Jonathan Moyo and it was used to spon­sor Zanu PF ral­lies. We have also wit­nessed Zanu PF dol­ing out res­i­den­tial stands and giv­ing food to prospec­tive vot­ers in the coun­try. Peo­ple should be wary of such ten­den­cies. Jus­tice de­layed is jus­tice de­nied. Paras­tatals are the most tar­geted ar­eas of cor­rup­tion. Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa is read­ing from the same script which his pre­de­ces­sor al­ways read from about cor­rup­tion, but it looks like he is even worse than Mu­gabe. As long as we keep sweep­ing cor­rup­tion un­der the car­pet Zim­babwe will con­tinue to re­pel in­vestors. The level of cor­rup­tion in Zim­babwe has now reached crit­i­cal lev­els and if no ac­tion is taken the coun­try is go­ing to be a ba­nana repub­lic and a laugh­ing stock of other coun­tries. A once vi­brant and jewel of Africa econ­omy, Zim­babwe has now sunk deep in eco­nomic morass.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20190224,Un­der­stand­ing what you know,"ONE of the things that in­ter­est me is power dis­tri­bu­tion in the world. I love ob­serv­ing how power is moved from one per­son to the next, how peo­ple re­main pow­er­ful al­most from birth to death and how some try their en­tire lives to gain power and con­trol but seem to be do­ing it in vain. Gen­er­ally all peo­ple de­sire power, they de­sire con­trol of some sort. The ex­tent of the con­trol one may de­sire may dif­fer, but, they all de­sire to be in con­trol. Oth­ers may only want it as far as their home, they may de­sire to be in full con­trol of their home. Oth­ers may want it at work, some over a par­tic­u­lar in­dus­try, like Strive Masiyiwa and tele­coms. It all de­pends on the in­di­vid­ual. I read a statis­tic that blew my mind last week. Fifty years ago, China barely had roads. But to­day they build 6 000 miles of road net­works in a year. China is quickly be­com­ing a world power of note. Silently the Chi­nese have worked out a for­mula to be­come pow­er­ful and by the time we woke up, it was al­most late. These guys are al­ready in over­drive. I asked one Chi­nese man who is also a pow­er­ful man in his na­tion how China moved from in­signif­i­cance to power in a short space of time and his an­swer was sim­ple. Knowl­edge. He gave an ex­am­ple, he said, the West is far ahead of the rest of the world in un­der­stand­ing the way things work, so China has spent years send­ing their bright­est mines to the top uni­ver­si­ties in the West. That way, they have an un­der­stand­ing of how the world sys­tems func­tion and so un­der­stand how to ma­nip­u­late them. So power comes from knowl­edge. If you know what oth­ers don’t, you be­come pow­er­ful be­cause your mind puts you ahead of the pack. For knowl­edge to have an im­pact, it must be un­der­stood. You may know a lot of things, but if you do not un­der­stand what you know, then it is use­less knowl­edge be­cause it can­not be used as a tool to gain con­trol and power. Chris­tians know that the is­sue in Zim­babwe is not which party is in power, it is a spir­i­tual one. But they do not un­der­stand the mean­ing of this. So be­cause we Chris­tians do not un­der­stand the knowl­edge we have, it is hard for us to use it for any­thing sig­nif­i­cant. So Zim­babwe will re­main the way it is, be­cause Chris­tians do not un­der­stand what they know. If we un­der­stood what we know, we would pray more for our na­tion, if we un­der­stood what we know we would pray more for our lead­ers re­gard­less of how you feel about them. But be­cause we do not un­der­stand the spir­i­tual move­ment in this na­tion, we pray one thing, and im­me­di­ately af­ter, we de­stroy all our prayer ef­forts by speak­ing ill of the very thing we are pray­ing for. To cre­ate power, the knowl­edge you pos­sess must be un­der­stood by you that pos­sesses if. Fol­low this sim­ple train of thought with me. You know that the friends you have de­ter­mine who you are, hence the say­ing, show me your friends and I will show you who you are. You know that who you are de­ter­mines what you will be­come or who you be­come. You want to be a world class physi­cist, yet your friend is a mid­core mind. This does not make sense at all. It’s a per­fect ex­am­ple of some­one with knowl­edge but has no idea how to use it be­cause they do not un­der­stand what it means. I have al­ways said, ev­ery­one you see on the street in­clud­ing your­self is that way be­cause of the way they think. The way you think is sub­ject to what you know and your un­der­stand­ing of the knowl­edge you pos­sess. The poor are poor be­cause they have thought pat­terns that al­low poverty to grow. They un­der­stand how to per­pet­u­ate poverty. The rich are that way be­cause they have thought pat­terns that al­low wealth to grow. These thought pat­terns al­low wealth to know by the way they are put into ac­tion by the owner of the thoughts. This is re­gard­less of how one grew up or ex­po­sure. That is why a man born in the ru­ral ar­eas can be wealthy by the time he turns 30, and a child born in a rich fam­ily can be re­duced to liv­ing in the street in the same time frame. Priv­i­lege can only do so much for you, you will need to ap­ply your­self. It is all about how you use what you know. No one knows ev­ery­thing, so it is about util­is­ing the lit­tle you know to the max­i­mum in or­der to get the best re­sults and do­ing it again and again un­til you reach your tar­get. The word says, as a man thinks, so shall he be. Last year I ex­plained on the thought pro­cesses that de­ter­mine a king from a sim­ple man. The first thought is that you are a king be­cause your father in Heaven is a King. Yes, this is very true, it is sub­ject to what you choose to be­lieve which is sec­ond thought. If you choose to be­lieve that you were born to eat and die, then rest as­sured you big­gest achieve­ment will be chew­ing, di­gest­ing and the rest of the process, de­spite you be­liev­ing that you are the son of a King. What you then do about it de­pends on your thoughts. If your mind takes ad­van­tage of what is in the Bi­ble to bet­ter your life, then you will do well. But if you think they are just sto­ries read for us to feel good about a man that rose from the dead, then that is all you will be. Know you are a king, sift what you hear and al­low only pos­i­tive thoughts and force your mind to utilise what you know to bet­ter your life. You will make it with­out fail. Be blessed.",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170202,New era dawns as Sino-Zim ties strengthen,"THE sign­ing of the mega deals be­tween Zim­babwe and China worth bil­lions of dol­lars in the past three years, sig­nalled a new chap­ter in the two coun­tries’ re­la­tions. The deals are based on China’s win-win co­op­er­a­tion and mu­tual re­la­tions with Zim­babwe that have ex­isted for sev­eral decades. The scope of the mega deals, some of which are al­ready be­ing im­ple­mented, will change the sta­tus of the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy. It is a new era for Zim­babwe, which will emerge as the big­gest ben­e­fi­ciary in its re­la­tions with the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant. China has made it clear that it is willing to help not only Zim­babwe, but other African coun­tries to realise their long cher­ished dream of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. It is im­por­tant that the mega deals signed with Zim­babwe are in dif­fer­ent sec­tors of the econ­omy. Crit­ics of both gov­ern­ments have been at the fore­front of dis­cred­it­ing the mega deals, es­pe­cially when they think they are tak­ing too long to be im­ple­mented. For starters, the first of the deals were signed when Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe paid a State visit to China in 2014. The other deals were put on pa­per when Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping came to Zim­babwe on a sim­i­lar State visit at the end 2015. This was be­fore Pres­i­dent Xi pro­ceeded to South Africa for the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion, where he ex­panded on the new chap­ter in co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two coun­tries. At that meet­ing, Pres­i­dent Xi out­lined a 10-point plan which en­com­passes all the nec­es­sary as­pects of en­hanc­ing Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, with help from his coun­try. With Zim­babwe, it has been barely three years since the sign­ing of the mega deals. But some me­dia out­lets have been reg­u­larly cam­paign­ing to dis­credit them. Po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents of Zanu-PF, es­pe­cially op­po­si­tion of­fi­cials, have joined the band wagon in crit­i­cis­ing the mega deals. The im­pres­sion that peo­ple of like-mind want to cre­ate is that the mega deals have col­lapsed. Yet, this is con­trary to what ob­tains on the ground. The mega deals are alive and well, as ev­i­denced by the progress be­ing made, es­pe­cially in ar­eas of part­ner­ships be­tween firms from both coun­tries. The deals signed be­tween China and Zim­babwe were mainly aimed at kick-starting the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion of the econ­omy. The ma­jor driver of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is elec­tric­ity, which is nec­es­sary to power in­dus­tries and help mod­ernise sec­tors such as agri­cul­ture. With­out enough power gen­er­a­tion, most de­vel­op­men­tal as­pi­ra­tions of a coun­try can­not be achieved. This is why it is not sur­pris­ing that in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the mega deals, China and Zim­babwe have pri­ori­tised elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion. Those who crit­i­cise the mega deals al­ways make sure to avoid men­tion­ing progress be­ing made by Sino Hdyro in the ex­pan­sion of Kariba South Power Sta­tion. Sino Hy­dro is a Chi­nese firm in part­ner­ship with the Zim­babwe Power Com­pany in the Kariba project, which is part of the mega deals. The progress be­ing made at Kariba South rep­re­sents progress in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the deals. No coun­try can run a suc­cess­ful in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion pro­gramme with­out ad­e­quate sup­plies of elec­tric­ity. This is why China and Zim­babwe should be com­mended for tackling the im­por­tant is­sues first. The Kariba South project has be­come one of the pil­lars of the mega deals, as the suc­cess of most of them de­pends on the avail­abil­ity of elec­tric­ity. The good news is that by Christ­mas this year, the first unit of the new elec­tric­ity plant will be put on line, with the sec­ond ex­pected to start run­ning by March next year. Lat­est in­for­ma­tion shows that at least 75 per­cent of civil works have been com­pleted, while 30 per­cent of me­chan­i­cal in­stal­la­tions have been done. The project is ex­pected to add 300MW to the na­tional grid when at full throt­tle. Sino Hy­dro is al­ready work­ing on de­vel­op­ing the Hwange Seven and Eight power sup­ply units at Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion, which will add an­other 600MW. Zim­babwe gen­er­ates about 1 300MW against a peak de­mand of 2 200MW. For the ef­fi­cient op­er­a­tion of the econ­omy, the coun­try should also con­sider look­ing for part­ners to en­hance the power gen­er­a­tion of the other small power sta­tions. The small power sta­tions are in Harare, Bu­l­awayo and Mun­y­ati near Kwekwe . It should be com­mended that China and Zim­babwe have taken their time to work on the most im­por­tant as­pects of the mega deals. Once the elec­tric­ity sup­ply is up to scratch, the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the other deals will pick up pace. But that does not mean that all the work on the other deals has been stalled while wait­ing for Kariba South and Hwange Seven and Eight to start run­ning. The con­struc­tion of the new Par­lia­ment Build­ing in Mt Ham­p­den, for in­stance, has had fi­nan­cial clo­sure. The Chi­nese side is now ready to move in once Gov­ern­ment fin­ishes con­struct­ing the ac­cess road. Work on the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal hub, which is ex­pected to give a new im­pe­tus to the coun­try’s health delivery sys­tem, is just about to start. The estab­lish­ment of Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones and in­dus­trial parks in part­ner­ships with Chi­nese firms is now set to be re­alised. The im­ple­men­ta­tion of the zones was be­ing stalled by that there was no law fa­cil­i­tat­ing their estab­lish­ment. Last year, Gov­ern­ment worked with speed to en­act the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones Act, which will fa­cil­i­tate the estab­lish­ment of the spe­cial trade zones. These zones also need enough elec­tric­ity as they will de­pend on heavy in­dus­tries and rail­way trans­port, which need ad­e­quate and un­in­ter­rupted sup­plies of power. This is why the pri­or­ity of light­ing up Zim­babwe with enough elec­tric­ity is im­por­tant in the ma­trix of the mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion with China. Elec­tric­ity is cru­cial in all as­pects of de­vel­op­ment, es­pe­cially in in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, which goes hand in hand with trans­porta­tion. In fact, all types of in­dus­tries, be they for min­ing, agri­cul­ture, goods, tools, ve­hi­cles, air­craft, ma­chines, com­mu­ni­ca­tion equip­ment, need elec­tric­ity to func­tion ef­fec­tively. The ex­am­ple of de­vel­oped coun­tries which pri­ori­tised elec­tric­ity in their quest to im­prove them­selves, should be em­u­lated if Zim­babwe aims to progress to the next stage of its de­vel­op­ment. It is a fact that many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, with the ex­cep­tion of China and a few oth­ers, can­not gen­er­ate enough elec­tric­ity. And this has def­i­nitely af­fected their eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. Writ­ing a pa­per for The Asia-Pa­cific Jour­nal in 2012, John Mathews and Hao Tan in­di­cated that China’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion would not have been re­alised with­out ad­e­quate elec­tric­ity sup­ply. They ar­gue that China’s elec­tric­ity sup­ply strate­gies have been very ef­fec­tive. The strat­egy in­cludes har­ness­ing all the sources of en­ergy — gas, wind, so­lar, hy­dro and ther­mal, etc — to en­sure there is ad­e­quate sup­ply. Ac­tu­ally, in China, the de­vel­op­ment of power gen­er­a­tion was im­por­tant in fu­elling ur­ban­i­sa­tion, in­dus­trial growth and ris­ing the stan­dards of liv­ing. Ad­e­quate elec­tric­ity sup­ply in the Asian coun­try’s ru­ral ar­eas meant that in­dus­tries that de­pended on raw ma­te­ri­als from agri­cul­ture could eas­ily be set up. This contributed sig­nif­i­cantly to the up­lift­ing of the ru­ral folk from poverty, as enough elec­tric­ity sup­ply fa­cil­i­tated the mod­erni­sa­tion of agri­cul­ture. Zim­babwe is ex­actly in the same state that China was three decades ago and can learn vi­tal les­sons from how the Asian coun­try ex­tri­cated it­self from poverty.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150710,Data point to poorer global mid­dle class,"The global mid­dle class The global mid­dle class is both smaller and poorer than pre­vi­ously thought, ac­cord­ing to a new study, with hun­dreds of mil­lions who have re­cently emerged from poverty in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries still vul­ner­a­ble to fall­ing back into it. The re­search by the Washington-based Pew Re­search Cen­ter paints a pic­ture of en­trenched pros­per­ity in the rich economies of Europe and North Amer­ica and a world that is more di­vided than pre­vi­ous stud­ies have sug­gested. De­spite vast changes in China and other parts of Asia, there has only been in­cre­men­tal progress in large parts of the de­vel­op­ing world. Just 16 per cent of the world's pop­u­la­tion lives on in­comes that would take them safely above the US poverty line. The study will give pause to com­pa­nies that have bet heav­ily on a rapidly grow­ing mid­dle class in re­gions such as sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions such as Nestlé have al­ready be­gun to re­ex­am­ine strate­gies in what they had hoped would be strong growth mar­kets. The anal­y­sis is the first to pick apart the latest global house­hold sur­vey data avail­able and to use new es­ti­mates of rel­a­tive pur­chas­ing power re­leased by the World Bank last year to ex­am­ine trends in both the de­vel­op­ing and de­vel­oped world. Defin­ing what ""mid­dle class"" means is no­to­ri­ously dif­fi­cult and the source of much de­bate among de­vel­op­ment econ­o­mists. Past es­ti­mates have put the size of the global mid­dle class at up to 2bn peo­ple. The Pew re­searchers, how­ever, found that even tak­ing its broad­est def­i­ni­tion and count­ing those liv­ing on be­tween $10 and $100 a day, just 1.7bn peo­ple could be con­sid­ered mid­dle class at the end of the first decade of this cen­tury. ""The global mid­dle class is smaller than we think, it is less well off than we think, and it is more re­gion­ally con­cen­trated than we think,"" said Rakesh Kochhar, the lead au­thor. Glob­ally, Pew said, 71 per cent of the world's pop­u­la­tion still ranked as poor or low-in­come in 2011, the latest year for which all global data are avail­able, com­pared with 79 per cent in 2001. Al­most 670m peo­ple rose above the $2 a day global poverty line in the decade to 2011. That is far be­low the poverty line as de­fined in the US, which stood at $15.77 a day in 2011. The change still left 3.4bn peo­ple, or 56 per cent of the world's pop­u­la­tion, liv­ing only just above the global poverty line, on $2 to $10 a day - equiv­a­lent to a fam­ily of four earn­ing $2,920 to $14,600 a year. The num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing on $10 to $20 a day, dubbed ""mid­dle in­come"" by Pew, rose from 399m to 784m in the decade, with more than half in Asia and the South Pa­cific. China ac­counted for most of the in­crease, with its mid­dle in­come pop­u­la­tion swell- ing from just 32m to 235m be­tween 2001 and 2011. How­ever, the vast ma­jor­ity of the world's well-off house­holds - those liv­ing on more than $50 a day - are still in North Amer­ica and Europe. About 87 per cent of the world's ""high­in­come"" pop­u­la­tion lived in the two re­gions in 2011, down only marginally from 91 per cent in 2001. By con­trast, just 1 per cent of high-in­come pop­u­la­tions live in Africa, 4 per cent in South Amer­ica and 8 per cent in Asia and the South Pa­cific. The US is home to the big­gest high-in­come pop­u­la­tion, but the re­ces­sions of the 2000s took their toll on its per­for­mance rel­a­tive to Europe and Canada, the study found. In 2001 North Amer­ica ac­counted for 54 per cent of the world's ""high in­come"" peo­ple. By 2011 that fig­ure had fallen to 46 per cent. The share of the US pop­u­la­tion that is high­in­come fell from 58 per cent in 2001 to 56 per cent in 2011, even as Canada saw its share jump from 49 per cent to 56 per cent. The ranks of high-in­come in­di­vid­u­als also swelled in western Europe, ris­ing from 35 per cent to 44 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion. As a re­sult, a num­ber of Euro­pean coun­tries have crept ahead of the US when judged by the share of their pop­u­la­tions where a fam­ily of four earns $73,000 or more a year. In 2001 only Ger­many and Den­mark matched or ex­ceeded the US on this mea­sure, but by 2011 they were joined by Nor­way, Lux­em­bourg, the Nether­lands, Ice­land and Fin­land. Pew's fig­ures mea­sure gross in­comes, ex­clud­ing the ef­fects of Europe's higher taxes and so­cial con­tri­bu­tions, which would af­fect the pic­ture. The lack of progress among mid­dle-in­come Amer­i­cans has be­come a source of anx­i­ety and po­lit­i­cal de­bate in the US. Me­dian house­hold in­come fell from $53,646 in 2001 to $50,054 in 2011, cut by fac­tors in­clud­ing glob­al­i­sa­tion, the dis­place­ment of mid­dle-in­come jobs by tech­nol­ogy, and the de­cline of unions.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200601,Are we read­ing the signs of the COVID-19 times?,"A LOT of things are chang­ing across the world since the COVID-19 pan­demic started six months ago. It may not be easy to no­tice them as the rest of the world re­mains en­gulfed in the fight against the virus. Of course, some are just too blind to read the new signs of the times. In Zim­babwe, the po­lit­i­cal dust is vi­ti­at­ing our vi­sion. Emo­tional in­vest­ment in pol­i­tics is drain­ing logic and ra­tio­nal­ity. The main op­po­si­tion party is im­plod­ing, so ev­ery­one is wor­ried. The rul­ing party is aloof as ever, so ev­ery­one is an­gry. Al­most ev­ery­one is too po­lit­i­cally im­mersed, blink­ered and locked. The ob­ses­sion with triv­ial po­lit­i­cal bat­tles — some ar­chaic, ir­rel­e­vant and ego­is­tic — is un­par­al­leled. The sense of na­tional in­ter­est was lost at in­de­pen­dence. If the na­tion was not stu­pe­fied by triv­ial pol­i­tics, per­haps by now we would have fo­cused at­ten­tion on im­por­tant mat­ters. We would have re­alised that the fu­ture of na­tions after this pan­demic will be de­cided by how coun­tries read and ad­just to the signs of COVID-19 times. We will be in a dog eat dog sit­u­a­tion sooner than later. For ar­chaic lead­er­ship such as ours, these signs have no ma­te­rial sig­nif­i­cance to them given their in­abil­ity to wake up to the re­al­i­ties of COVID-19. The re­al­ity is that be­yond the health is­sue, COVID-19 is a ma­jor poverty, de­vel­op­men­tal and eco­nomic is­sue. The Fi­nance min­istry should be more wor­ried than his health coun­ter­part. It is called pro­gres­sive think­ing. Our an­a­lysts and aca­demics have a duty of help­ing our lead­er­ship to un­der­stand these signs of the times and in­ter­pret them in light of their medium to long-term im­pli­ca­tions both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally. They must de­ci­pher the signs of to­day and in­ter­pret their mean­ings. Some­times it is not al­ways about per­sis­tently re­mind­ing lead­er­ship how use­less they are. Some­times it is about re­fo­cus­ing an aloof lead­er­ship to what is likely to threaten their throne and awaken them to the real­i­sa­tion that threats such as COVID-19, know no big walls, mil­i­tary mighty or bound­aries. The only way to pro­tect them­selves from such is by de­vel­op­ing the na­tion. The ef­fects of poverty are now con­ta­gious than be­fore. One of the clear signs a les­son drawn from the COVID-19 ex­pe­ri­ence is that loot­ing and ex­ter­nal­is­ing na­tional re­sources comes to nil when the pan­demic ground the world to a halt. We have seen re­stric­tions plac­ing a wedge be­tween the loot­ers and their loot. This is a wake-up call to lead­ers who de­cide to steal that they now have to keep their wealth in coun­try. That way, the same re­sources can help in­ject liq­uid­ity into the econ­omy and can quickly be used to ad­dress ur­gent needs such as re­fur­bish­ing hos­pi­tals. The other sign, more dan­ger­ous than the plun­der by our lead­er­ship, is the rapid re-emer­gence of pro­tec­tion­ism, na­tion­al­ism and racism as well as xeno­pho­bia in other coun­tries. The mes­sage com­ing out of these de­vel­op­ments is sim­ple: ev­ery na­tion­al­ity is now on its own and gov­ern­ments are now pri­ori­tis­ing their own peo­ple and in­ter­ests. Re­sources and op­por­tu­ni­ties after the COVID-19 pan­demic will be lim­ited and gov­ern­ments, mainly those wise enough to read the signs of the times, are adopt­ing pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies, while their cit­i­zens are pushed by cir­cum­stances to be either racist or xeno­pho­bic in pro­tect­ing lim­ited op­por­tu­ni­ties. Pro­tec­tion­ism is a pol­icy when a coun­try shields its do­mes­tic in­dus­try from for­eign com­pe­ti­tion by im­pos­ing taxes and other re­stric­tions. In a con­text where economies are tum­bling, pro­tec­tion­ism is seen as the po­lit­i­cally right move to take to shield lo­cal busi­nesses and work­ers from for­eign com­peti­tors. In pre­vi­ous in­stal­ments, I have cau­tioned our lack of ac­tion or re­ac­tion on how neigh­bour­ing coun­tries are ad­just­ing to this new re­al­ity. Again, these is­sues have ways of back­fir­ing. South Africa an­nounced on May 7 that it is look­ing to for­malise a new em­ploy­ment pol­icy which will re­strict the num­ber of for­eign na­tion­als work­ing in spe­cific sec­tors of the econ­omy, mainly res­tau­rants which are staffed by for­eign­ers, largely Zim­bab­weans. On May 20, the govern­ment of Botswana is­sued a gazette an­nounc­ing mea­sures on spe­cific sec­tors to be wholly owned by lo­cals. Most of those out­lined in the gazette such as the con­struc­tion and the in­for­mal ser­vice sec­tors are dom­i­nated by for­eign­ers, mainly Zim­bab­weans. For a wise leader read­ing these signs of the times, this sim­ply means by the be­gin­ning of June, there is go­ing to be a mas­sive loss of jobs and eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­bab­weans in these two coun­tries. Most likely those af­fected will be pushed back home by either des­ti­tu­tion or new waves of xeno­pho­bia. This will also re­sult in a huge drop in re­mit­tances a source of vi­tal life­line for many fam­i­lies, re­duce the avail­abil­ity of hard cur­rency and fur­ther weak­en­ing the ex­change rate. These plus drought and a poor econ­omy will put Zim­babwe back on the re­gional and global agenda amid an un­fold­ing catas­tro­phe. That’s not all. In­ter­na­tional aid, both in cash or kind, will dras­ti­cally drop as donor coun­tries are pri­ori­tis­ing ad­dress­ing the do­mes­tic im­pact of the pan­demic or di­vert­ing re­sources to COVID-19-re­lated pro­grammes. The do­na­tions from China to Africa are most likely left­overs from their COVID-19 re­sponse. The fu­ture looks dry and lonely. We can only sur­vive it if we read and ad­just to the signs of the COVID-19 times now.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210101,"A toast for 2021, but...","We bid 2020 goodbye, the year many would want to quickly for­get con­trary to views, at least if one wears Zim­babwe’s po­lit­i­cal lenses. The past nine months have been no­to­ri­ous given the COVID-19, the March 30 Supreme Court judge­ment of the MDC-T lead­er­ship wran­gles, poor ser­vice de­liv­ery by lo­cal au­thor­i­ties, al­leged hu­man rights abuses through kid­nap­pings, ab­duc­tions and abuse of po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents by State ap­pa­ra­tuses, wors­en­ing of the econ­omy, shrink­ing of demo­cratic space and a step closer to one-party sys­tem in Zim­babwe. Whether, this bode well for democ­racy is another thing. But, if there is one thing Zimbabweans and the whole wide world agree on, it is that we badly need a New Year. Wel­come 2021, but, there’s no guar­an­tee that the new year will be “bright­ish.” We are hop­ing that COVID-19 vac­cine will help save lives. Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa this week waxed lyri­cal about achieve­ments of his govern­ment in 2020. He was ad­dress­ing the Zanu PF cen­tral com­mit­tee. His ut­ter­ances could not be fur­ther from the truth as the year was the apt description of an­nus hor­ri­b­lis. Health and ed­u­ca­tion sec­tors suf­fered the most dur­ing the year. The fail­ure by the govern­ment to im­prove the poor work­ing con­di­tions of nurses and to pro­vide them with per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment re­sulted in a strike by health work­ers which lasted more than three months. The dec­la­ra­tion by Vice-Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga that the coun­try would not al­low cit­i­zens to seek health care out­side Zim­babwe due to the loss of the much needed for­eign cur­rency but for him to fly out to China for treat­ment was not only shame­ful but an in­di­ca­tion of the govern­ment’s lack of trust in the coun­try’s health sys­tem which it has de­stroyed through a com­bi­na­tion of in­com­pe­tence and ne­glect. The pic­ture, which went vi­ral, of still­births at the Sally Mu­gabe Hos­pi­tal (for­merly Harare Cen­tral Hos­pi­tal) due to the sham­bolic run­ning of the health ser­vices sec­tor will for­ever re­main etched in the minds of cit­i­zens as the clear­est sign of govern­ment’s fail­ure to pro­vide ad­e­quate crit­i­cal health­care in 2020. It was no dif­fer­ent in the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor where teach­ers downed tools over poor work­ing con­di­tions dis­rupt­ing lessons and short­changed school­child­ren. Mnan­gagwa’s ut­ter­ances are tragic, to say the least. For it was in July this year that in­fla­tion sky­rock­eted to more than 800%. Although it has since come down to just over 400%, it re­mains the sec­ond high­est in the world only be­hind strife torn Venezuela. In 2020, the govern­ment was forced to climb down from the ridicu­lous Statu­tory In­stru­ment 142 which banned the multi-cur­rency regime and made the lo­cal cur­rency the sole le­gal ten­der af­ter the Zim­babwe dol­lar mas­sively lost value re­sult­ing in in­fla­tion which has eroded wages and in­comes de­nom­i­nated in the Zim­babwe dol­lar. The govern­ment then rein­tro­duced the multi-cur­rency regime un­der the dis­guise of ame­lio­rat­ing the im­pact of COVID-19. That, plus the clam­p­down on pro-de­moc- racy protests, ar­rests and their ab­duc­tions, his dec­la­ra­tion that 2020 was a year of achieve­ment is not only laugh­able but also delu­sional. Thus, we hope cit­i­zens will take ad­van­tage of the good rains ex­pected in the coun­try and grow their sta­ple, to cush­ion them­selves from the va­garies of poverty knock­ing on their doors.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200611,Tick­ing debt bomb in Africa threat­ens global ex­plo­sion,"THE new air­port serv­ing the An­golan cap­i­tal of Luanda was in­tended to be a bright and wel­com­ing sym­bol of the for­mer Por­tuguese colony’s re­nais­sance — a coun­ter­point to the three-decade civil war that ended in 2002. Two par­al­lel run­ways were to ac­com­mo­date even the big­gest jets, a new 40km rail line would whisk pas­sen­gers to the city cen­tre and a shim­mer­ing glass ter­mi­nal big­ger than the Pen­tagon was de­signed with dozens of restau­rants, bars, and shops for the 15 mil­lion vis­i­tors the gov­ern­ment ex­pected to pass through an­nu­ally. Six­teen years af­ter con­struc­tion crews broke ground, the ter­mi­nal — largely com­pleted in 2012 — is gath­er­ing dust in the flat scrub­land south­east of Luanda. The rail­way was never fin­ished, the run­ways have yet to see a com­mer­cial flight, and the open­ing date has been re­peat­edly pushed back — now ex­pected some­time in 2022 or 2023. What’s harder to push back, though, is the bil­lions of dol­lars in loans that funded con­struc­tion. While the gov­ern­ment hasn’t re­vealed the fi­nanc­ing de­tails, lo­cal me­dia es­ti­mate that An­gola owes Chi­nese cred­i­tors from $3 bil­lion to $9 bil­lion for the un­fin­ished fa­cil­ity. The Luanda air­port is just one of hun­dreds of megapro­jects that have su­per­charged African economies over the past decade. An­gola alone has built Kil­amba, a satel­lite city out­side the cap­i­tal that’s home to 80 000 peo­ple, two other air­ports, a state-of-the-art li­brary that was aban­doned half­way through con­struc­tion and four soc­cer sta­di­ums seat­ing as many as 50 000 spec­ta­tors. Across the con­ti­nent, gov­ern­ments have spent at least $77 bil­lion an­nu­ally since 2013, erect­ing ev­ery­thing from crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture such as bridges and hos­pi­tals to sump­tu­ous pres­i­den­tial vil­las and soar­ing mon­u­ments cel­e­brat­ing na­tional he­roes. The build­ing binge has been fu­elled by at least $600 bil­lion in loans, leav­ing African gov­ern­ments strug­gling with record debt. The obli­ga­tions were man­age­able — barely — when coun­tries in the re­gion were ex­pand­ing by as much as 10% an­nu­ally. But with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic shut­ting down trade and ham­mer­ing com­mod­ity prices, the debt bill threat­ens to un­ravel years of progress in for­ti­fy­ing economies and fight­ing poverty. Af­ter 25 years of un­in­ter­rupted growth, the re­gion this year will con­tract by 2,8%, the World Bank (WB) pre­dicts. The coro­n­avirus has cre­ated “the big­gest shock the global econ­omy has faced over the last cen­tury,” Charles Calomiris, a pro­fes­sor of pub­lic af­fairs at Columbia, said at a World Bank web meet­ing on June 1. And rapidly ex­pand­ing debt loads in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly Africa, will only mag­nify the dif­fi­cul­ties. “I’m scared to death,” he says. “The risks as­so­ci­ated with this pro­tracted and se­vere cri­sis com­ing from the un­payable debt prob­lem are go­ing to be un­prece­dented.” Pub­lic debt, which had dou­bled to about half the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic out­put since 2008, was rais­ing alarm bells at the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) even be­fore the COVID-19 pan­demic. The IMF says more than a third of African coun­tries are ap­proach­ing or al­ready ex­pe­ri­enc­ing “debt dis­tress” af­ter a slow­down in com­mod­ity prices in 2014. To­day, fall­out from the pan­demic makes the easy money of a few years ago an un­bear­able bur­den as the out­break threat­ens to over­whelm hos­pi­tals al­ready stretched thin by ill­nesses such as malaria and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis. “Our lead­ers have two choices: You ei­ther pay obli­ga­tions to bond­hold­ers or you buy medicine, food, and fuel for your pop­u­la­tion,” said Vera Songwe, head of the United Na­tions Eco­nomic Com­mis­sion for Africa. Africa’s strug­gle is be­com­ing a global prob­lem as the money has come from a China seek­ing to bol­ster its in­flu­ence in the re­gion and from global in­vestors hun­gry for re­turns in a world awash with neg­a­tive yields. African gov­ern­ments have sold al­most $60 bil­lion in bonds to pri­vate in­vestors in the past two years to pay for high­ways, fac­to­ries, and wages for their sprawl­ing bu­reau­cra­cies. A flurry of de­faults would threaten the new­found pros­per­ity that the debt buildup helped bring about. Boom­ing economies have re­duced poverty to the low­est lev­els since the 1990s and ush­ered in a new mid­dle class. Multi­na­tion­als sell­ing ev­ery­thing from cell­phones to soda raced to tap a mar­ket of more than one bil­lion con­sumers. But the UN pre­dicts the coro­n­avirus could add an ad­di­tional 29 mil­lion peo­ple to the more than 400 mil­lion Africans liv­ing in ex­treme poverty. The prob­lems could be even more dam­ag­ing than the re­gion’s last debt blowup, in the late 1990s — a han­gover from bor­row­ing that dated to the early 1960s, when newly in­de­pen­dent African coun­tries spent lav­ishly on in­fra­struc­ture and so­cial pro­grammes to forge na­tional iden­ti­ties and mod­ernise their economies. In 2005 wealthy na­tions and fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions agreed to write off $100 bil­lion in loans, but the cost to the re­gion was high: cur­rency de­val­u­a­tions that fu­elled hy­per­in­fla­tion and aus­ter­ity pro­grammes that forced steep cuts in so­cial spend­ing. Some in­vestors say the fears of a debt bomb are overblown and are bet­ting the eco­nomic fall­out of the pan­demic in Africa will be rel­a­tively mild. Yields on bonds from Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa have dropped to an aver­age of about 9% from al­most 13% in May, in­di­cat­ing that in­vestors are more op­ti­mistic about get­ting re­paid. Those lower yields mean gov­ern­ments may be able to raise funds in com­ing months even as their rev­enue plum­mets. And a re­cov­ery in prices for oil and min­er­als will help ex­port­ing coun­tries. But many aca­demics have be­gun com­par­ing the loom­ing debt cri­sis in Africa to the sov­er­eign and cor­po­rate de­faults that en­gulfed Latin Amer­ica fol­low­ing an in­flux of petrodol­lars in the 1980s. That calamity led to years of eco­nomic tur­moil in what be­came known as the re­gion’s lost decade as coun­tries starved for cash suf­fered re­cur­ring de­faults to in­ter­na­tional banks. “African growth will be stopped in its tracks,” says Pa­trick Bolton, a pro­fes­sor of busi­ness at Columbia. “The way things are play­ing out, there will likely be dif­fi­cult debt re­struc­tur­ings ahead.” Car­men Rein­hart, in­com­ing chief econ­o­mist at the WB, pre­dicts that any re­cov­ery will be slow and fraught with ten­sion. Most debtor coun­tries re­quire mul­ti­ple over­hauls to sta­bilise their economies, and ne­go­ti­a­tions with pri­vate cred­i­tors typ­i­cally drag on for four years or longer. “The re­struc­tur­ing process has this long backand-forth,” Rein­hart said at the June 1 WB web con­fer­ence. “I look at the re­struc­tur­ings of the 1920s and 1930s, and of the 1980s and 1990s, and what I see is a decade-long process.” The share of African gov­ern­ment rev­enue that goes to­wards external debt ser­vice has al­most tripled, to an aver­age of 13%, in the past 10 years, ac­cord­ing to the Ju­bilee Debt Cam­paign, a Lon­don group that ad­vo­cates relief for poor coun­tries. That’s more than gov­ern­ments in the re­gion spend on health­care, and the cost of pay­ing off loans is poised to climb fur­ther as economies shrink and lo­cal cur­ren­cies weaken. That, in turn, threat­ens to di­vert scarce re­sources from in­fra­struc­ture projects needed to fuel a re­cov­ery. The risk is great­est in coun­tries highly re­liant on sales of a sin­gle com­mod­ity. Zam­bia, which gets 70% of its for­eign ex­change from cop­per ex­ports, has seen its external gov­ern­ment debt jump sev­en­fold in a decade, to more than $11 bil­lion. In May it ap­pointed a fi­nan­cial ad­viser to re­struc­ture its obli­ga­tions. The IMF pre­dicts that debt ser­vice in An­gola, Africa’s num­ber two oil pro­ducer, this year will cost more than the gov­ern­ment’s to­tal rev­enue, and the Fi­nance min­istry has con­tacted China about reschedul­ing some loans. To stave off eco­nomic col­lapse, 25 African fi­nance min­is­ters in March wrote a let­ter to global lead­ers ask­ing for de­lays in $44 bil­lion in debt pay­ments due this year while they fo­cus on fight­ing the virus. In re­sponse, the Group of 20 lead­ing economies pro­posed an eight-month sus­pen­sion of pay­ments — to­talling about $11 bil­lion — from 73 of the world’s poor­est coun­tries, most of them in Africa. But progress has been slow, and only 12 coun­tries have got­ten a waiver so far. The G-20 gov­ern­ments have called on mul­ti­lat­eral lenders to join the mora­to­rium, but that may be dif­fi­cult. The WB and other de­vel­op­ment banks, which hold about a third of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa’s external pub­lic debt, says a sus­pen­sion threat­ens to tar­nish their own credit score; Fitch Rat­ings Inc has said a re­pay­ment freeze could spur a down­grade for de­vel­op­ment banks un­less share­hold­ers com­pen­sate them for losses. As an al­ter­na­tive, the WB has of­fered to ac­cel­er­ate de­liv­ery of tens of bil­lions of dol­lars in loans to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Pri­vate cred­i­tors have also been reluc­tant to join any sus­pen­sion, in­sist­ing that re­vamp­ing con­tracts could trig­ger credit down­grades and end up rais­ing in­ter­est on new debt that gov­ern­ments will need to bounce back from the pan­demic.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160505,China: Africa’s spring­board to in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion,"CHINA is fast prov­ing its met­tle on its com­mit­ment to help­ing African coun­tries come out of their sit­u­a­tions to oc­cupy global po­si­tions of pros­per­ity. While some peo­ple on the con­ti­nent are yet to wake up to that re­al­ity, the Asian coun­try has a drawn-out vi­sion which au­gurs well with the de­vel­op­men­tal as­pi­ra­tions of African coun­tries. That China has emerged as Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner in the last few years is undis­putable, with trade reach­ing $975,92 bil­lion be­tween 2011 and 2015. And many ob­servers have been won­der­ing why China has been able to oc­cupy such as po­si­tion with re­gards to Africa, which is of­ten por­trayed in neg­a­tive light by the West. The suc­cess of China’s in­vest­ment poli­cies in Africa can be at­trib­uted to the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant’s ap­proach to its re­la­tions with other na­tions. China has adopted a unique ap­proach in its for­eign pol­icy, which en­tails mu­tual re­spect, trust, equal­ity and mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion. That China and Africa have lived to­gether through dif­fi­cult times and have al­ways in­sisted on de­vel­op­ing mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion has acted as the ba­sis of their shared in­ter­est. What dis­tin­guishes China from other coun­tries in its re­la­tions with Africa is that the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant treats coun­tries on the con­ti­nent with sin­cer­ity. With glob­al­i­sa­tion tak­ing its toll on the world, in­clud­ing the down­ward trends in the world econ­omy, many had en­vis­aged the change of for­tunes in China-Africa re­la­tions. Yet China has never re­lented when it comes to Africa, con­tin­u­ing to com­mit for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in ar­eas such as in­fra­struc­ture, agri­cul­ture, con­struc­tion, min­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing. This ex­plains the growth in trade be­tween China and Africa as in­di­cated by the above high trade fig­ures. What is more im­por­tant in China-Africa re­la­tions is the fact that the Asian na­tion is clear that its poli­cies are the op­po­site of what for­mer colonis­ers want to prop­a­gate for Africa. This is re­flected in that China treats African coun­tries as equals, a move to­tally dif­fer­ent from how im­pe­ri­al­ist pow­ers con­duct their busi­ness on the con­ti­nent. China must be cred­ited for es­tab­lish­ing the ba­sis of such a flour­ish­ing re­la­tion­ship and it is now time for the co­op­er­a­tion to be taken a step fur­ther. De­ci­sions made at the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion held in Jo­han­nes­burg last year, must be taken se­ri­ously for this new era of re­la­tions to bear the de­sired re­sult. The sum­mit proved that China is com­mit­ted to help African coun­tries claim their right­ful place in the world order. The mile­stone of the sum­mit was that it set the de­vel­op­ment path to be fol­lowed in China-Africa re­la­tions. At the sum­mit, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping sum­marised this win-win co­op­er­a­tion by ex­tend­ing $60 bil­lion to the African con­ti­nent to, among other things, help the con­ti­nent in­dus­tri­alise. Of this amount, $5 bil­lion will be in the form of a grant and in­ter­est free loans, which can be ac­cessed by African coun­tries for dif­fer­ent pur­poses to en­hance their ca­pac­i­ties. The huge chunk of the money will go to­wards de­vel­op­ment of in­fra­struc­ture and kick-start­ing the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process for the con­ti­nent. This sums up the new di­rec­tion China is tak­ing for the de­vel­op­ment of Africa and ma­jor pos­i­tive changes on the con­ti­nent in the fore­see­able fu­ture will be caused by the Asian coun­try. Chi­nese di­rec­tor-gen­eral in the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs Mr Lin Song­tian re­cently aptly summed up this new level of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa. And no one can ar­gue against his pro­nun­ci­a­tion of the re­la­tions be­tween China and Africa and quot­ing him will bring the point home more ef­fec­tively. While of­fi­cially open­ing the China-Africa Think Tanks Fo­rum in Yiwu city in south­ern China re­cently, Mr Lin said his coun­try had “en­tered a new stage of de­vel­op­ment which needs to trans­fer a large num­ber of ad­van­ta­geous in­dus­tries and pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity over­seas”. He said African coun­tries hope to learn from China’s suc­cess­ful de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence and de­vel­op­ment model to im­prove their ca­pa­bil­i­ties. An­other im­por­tant point noted by Mr Lin was that African coun­tries en­joyed “the ad­van­tages of abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, pop­u­la­tion div­i­dend and great mar­ket po­ten­tial”. China, on the other hand, “has the com­par­a­tive de­vel­op­ment ad­van­tages in cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy, mar­ket, busi­nesses, ca­pa­ble per­son­nel and suc­cess­ful de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence”. It is a fact that African coun­tries are grap­pling to be­come in­de­pen­dent eco­nom­i­cally and chart their own ways for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. But they can­not be suc­cess­ful with­out the help from other coun­tries, es­pe­cially in terms of tech­no­log­i­cal trans­fer and for­eign in­vest­ments. China has stepped in at the right time for the pur­pose. To show its se­ri­ous­ness in im­ple­ment­ing the out­comes of the Jo­han­nes­burg FOCAC sum­mit, China re­cently se­lected eight coun­tries it will use as mod­els for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and ca­pac­ity build­ing. This is only the first step which will even­tu­ally lead to the com­plete in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent in due course. The coun­tries cho­sen for this demon­stra­tion phase are Ethiopia, Kenya, Tan­za­nia, the Republic of Congo, South Africa, Egypt, An­gola and Mozam­bique. The se­lec­tion of th­ese coun­tries was done af­ter China care­fully con­sid­ered the con­di­tions nec­es­sary for a quick turn­around to fa­cil­i­tate the spread of the con­cept to other coun­tries. It was good that Mr Lin ex­plained that other coun­tries should not feel left out as they will con­tinue to ben­e­fit from the Asian coun­try in other ways. “By choos­ing demon­stra­tion coun­tries and pri­or­ity part­ners in Africa for pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion, China does not mean to ex­clude other African coun­tries,” he ex­plained. “Nei­ther will such an ap­proach af­fect nor­mal mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Chi­nese busi­nesses and other African coun­tries. “In do­ing so, we mainly draw on China’s ex­pe­ri­ence of start­ing with some pi­lot work and spread the suc­cess­ful prac­tice later, a les­son ac­cu­mu­lated through its re­form and open­ing up and use suc­cess­ful co­op­er­a­tion to build demon­stra­tion coun­tries and zones and strengthen de­vel­op­ment of com­pre­hen­sive China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion.” In do­ing all this, China will be guided by the 10-Point Plan enun­ci­ated by Pres­i­dent Xi at the Jo­han­nes­burg FOCAC sum­mit. The plan has be­come the ba­sis of the new com­mit­ment the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant is tak­ing to­wards Africa. Ac­cord­ing to Pres­i­dent Xi, the first point is that China will im­ple­ment the China-Africa in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion plan through pro­mot­ing in­dus­try part­ner­ing and pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity co­op­er­a­tion. Sec­ond: Im­ple­ment China-Africa agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion plan, where China will share ex­pe­ri­ences in agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment and trans­fer read­ily ap­pli­ca­ble tech­nolo­gies. Third: Im­ple­ment the China-Africa in­fra­struc­ture plan which will in­clude plan­ning, de­sign, con­struc­tion, op­er­a­tion and main­te­nance of the in­fra­struc­ture. Fourth: Im­ple­ment the China-Africa fi­nan­cial plan to in­crease in­vest­ment flows. Fifth: Im­ple­ment China-Africa green de­vel­op­ment plan which will see projects be­ing launched to de­velop clean en­ergy, pro­tect wildlife, pro­mote en­vi­ron­ment-friendly agri­cul­ture and build smart cities. Sixth: Im­ple­ment the China-Africa trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion plan. Sev­enth: Im­ple­ment China-Africa poverty re­duc­tion plan by in­creas­ing aid to Africa and carry out poverty re­duc­tion pro­grammes fo­cus­ing on women and chil­dren. Eighth: Im­ple­ment China-Africa pub­lic health plan by help­ing strengthen pub­lic health preven­tion and con­trol sys­tems, as well as ca­pac­ity build­ing in Africa. Ninth: Im­ple­ment China-Africa cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple plan through the build­ing of cul­tural cen­tres, pro­vid­ing satel­lite TV re­cep­tion to vil­lages, schol­ar­ships, study trips and more di­rect flights to en­cour­age tourism. Tenth: Im­ple­ment the China-Africa peace and se­cu­rity plan where the Asian coun­try will pro­vide a $60 mil­lion grant to sup­port the build­ing and op­er­a­tion of the African Standby Force and the African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Cri­sis. AZIMBABWE Peo­ple First (ZimPF) Chi­tung­wiza co-or­di­na­tor Marakia Bo­mani was re­cently quoted in the pri­vate Press say­ing his party is tar­get­ing the rul­ing Zanu-PF party’s strongholds in ru­ral ar­eas as a way of try­ing to im­prove its sup­port base ahead of the 2018 elec­tions. How­ever, what Bo­mani fails to un­der­stand is that ZANU-PF is a party of peo­ple’s choice, be it in ru­ral ar­eas or ur­ban ar­eas. In ru­ral ar­eas, other op­po­si­tion par­ties like MDC-T have tried and failed to gain a po­lit­i­cal foothold. Nor­mally, op­po­si­tion par­ties are poorly vi­able to amass votes for them to win elec­tions. Most op­po­si­tion par­ties in Zim­babwe in­clud­ing ZimPF lack vi­able eco­nomic and de­vel­op­ment poli­cies that are nec­es­sary for the trans­for­ma­tion of the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy. Cit­i­zens pre­fer to vote for a party they have much trust and con­fi­dence in rather than vot­ing for a new kid on the po­lit­i­cal block. Truth be told, most op­po­si­tion lead­ers place their own in­ter­ests and ca­reers ahead of the elec­torate. This ex­plains why op­po­si­tion par­ties lose most elec­tions es­pe­cially in ru­ral ar­eas. Op­po­si­tion par­ties only be­came ac­tive if they are promised fi­nan­cial re­sources by their donors from the West. As it stands, op­po­si­tion par­ties are in a po­lit­i­cal race, try­ing to in­spire their fun­ders. It is ZimPF’s wish­ful think­ing to",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200927,World lead­ers call for an end to sanc­tions,"At the vir­tual meet­ing of the 75th United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, US elec­tions, mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, sanc­tions and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions dom­i­nated the agenda. World lead­ers ad­dressed an in­creas­ingly not-so United Na­tions. The an­nual meet­ing, which nor­mally takes place in New York, was moved on­line this year be­cause of coro­n­avirus. Here is a sum­mary of what the world lead­ers said. *** Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa Mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is un­der in­creas­ing threat from the blind pur­suit of nar­row in­ter­est. We must, there­fore, strengthen in­ter­na­tional amity and good­will as well as up­hold mu­tual re­spect and ob­serve the sovereign equal­ity of states. Your Ex­cel­lences, Zim­babwe is on a new path. Like other na­tions in the re­gion, we are fac­ing hu­man­i­tar­ian chal­lenges, which, in our case, have been wors­ened by il­le­gal sanc­tions, the neg­a­tive im­pact of cli­mate change and com­pounded by the out­break of the Covid19 pan­demic. How­ever, my ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tin­ues to record no­table achieve­ments to­wards sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment which leaves no one be­hind. Our macro-eco­nomic sta­bil­i­sa­tion re­forms have seen the re­duc­tion of our bud­get deficit to a sin­gle digit, as well as a pos­i­tive bal­ance of our cur­rent ac­count, cou­pled with for­eign ex­change rate and prices sta­bil­ity. Cyril Ramaphosa The cur­rent com­po­si­tion of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil does not re­flect the world in which we live. On the 75th an­niver­sary of the UN we re­peat our call for greater rep­re­sen­ta­tion of African coun­tries on the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, and that this be taken up with ur­gency at the In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Ne­go­ti­a­tions. It is only through a re­formed and in­clu­sive UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil that we will be able to col­lec­tively re­solve some of the world’s most pro­tracted con­flicts. As we cel­e­brate the found­ing of an or­gan­i­sa­tion ded­i­cated to free­dom and equal­ity, the peo­ple of Pales­tine and Western Sa­hara con­tinue to live un­der oc­cu­pa­tion. To en­sure that no coun­try is left be­hind, we re­it­er­ate our po­si­tion as the African Union that eco­nomic sanc­tions against Zim­babwe and Su­dan should be lifted to al­low their Gov­ern­ments to re­spond ad­e­quately to the pan­demic. We re­peat our call for an end to the il­le­gal oc­cu­pa­tion of Western Sa­hara and for the Palestinian peo­ple’s right to self-de­ter­mi­na­tion. To­day we bat­tle the fires of a deadly pan­demic, of racism and prej­u­dice, of vi­o­lence, war and ex­trem­ism and, above all, of poverty and in­equal­ity. The or­der we seek to build must be rooted in sol­i­dar­ity, equal­ity and unity of pur­pose. Uhuru Keny­atta The Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral’s re­cent ap­peal for a global cease­fire also in­cludes a hu­man­i­tar­ian call for the roll-back of in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions and to re­in­force the ef­forts of vul­ner­a­ble, frag­ile and con­flict-af­fected coun­tries, to deal with the im­pact of Covid-19. I state to­day that Kenya stands be­hind this ini­tia­tive. In this con­nec­tion, I wish to make a spe­cial ap­peal for an end to the eco­nomic and com­mer­cial as well as fi­nan­cial em­bargo against Cuba, sanc­tions against Zim­babwe and Su­dan. The United Na­tions pro­vides us a plat­form, a plat­form to re­solve age-old dif­fer­ences and un­bur­den our­selves of th­ese an­ti­quated con­flicts. Hage Gein­gob As the world bat­tles the pan­demic, Gein­gob said some mem­ber states face more ob­sta­cles in com­bat­ing this virus than oth­ers, in­clud­ing those with sanc­tions im­posed on them. “In sup­port of the pur­suit of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, unity and pros­per­ity for the sis­ter coun­try of Zim­babwe, I once again call on the lift­ing of sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe.” Gein­gob said Zim­bab­wean Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has been pur­su­ing re­forms that would en­able the peo­ple of Zim­babwe to get on a path of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and peace. He said Namibia re­it­er­ates her deep con­cern over the con­tin­u­a­tion of the ex­trater­ri­to­rial eco­nomic, fi­nan­cial and com­mer­cial em­bargo im­posed on the peo­ple of Cuba. Don­ald Trump In his speech as host na­tion, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ac­cused Bei­jing of spread­ing what he called “the China virus” and de­manded the UN hold it accountable. He de­fended his own han­dling of Covid-19 in the United States where the death toll has passed 200 000. “We have waged a fierce bat­tle against the in­vis­i­ble en­emy which has claimed count­less lives in 188 coun­tries,” Trump said in a pre-recorded ad­dress to the UNGA that lasted less than seven min­utes. Xi Jin­ping By con­trast, China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping struck a con­cil­ia­tory tone, call­ing for en­hanced co­op­er­a­tion over the pan­demic and stress­ing that China had no in­ten­tion of fight­ing “ei­ther a Cold War or a hot one” with any other coun­try. Xi said at­tempts to politi­cise the pan­demic should be re­jected. “China is the largest de­vel­op­ing coun­try in the world, a coun­try that is com­mit­ted to peace­ful, open, co-op­er­a­tive and com­mon de­vel­op­ment.” Has­san Rouhani Ira­nian Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani promised the next US leader must ac­cept Tehran’s de­mands, rul­ing out com­pro­mise as Trump vies for re-elec­tion. “We are not a bar­gain­ing chip in US elec­tions and do­mes­tic pol­icy,” Rouhani said. “Any US ad­min­is­tra­tion af­ter the up­com­ing elec­tions will have no choice but to sur­ren­der to the re­silience of the Ira­nian na­tion.” Vladimir Putin Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin called for an in­ter­na­tional treaty to pro­hibit weapons in space and of­fered Rus­sia’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine to UN em­ploy­ees for free. “Rus­sia is ready to pro­vide the UN with all the nec­es­sary qual­i­fied as­sis­tance. In par­tic­u­lar, we are of­fer­ing to pro­vide our vac­cine, free of charge, for the vol­un­tary vac­ci­na­tion of the staff of the UN and its of­fices,” Putin said. He said the global eco­nomic down­turn caused by the pan­demic re­news the need for re­mov­ing trade sanc­tions. Emmanuel Macron French Pres­i­dent Emmanuel Macron said Europe would not com­pro­mise with the US over Wash­ing­ton’s move to re­ac­ti­vate sanc­tions on Iran, warn­ing the so-called snap­back could un­der­mine the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (UNSC) and in­crease Mid­dle East ten­sions. “We will not com­pro­mise on the ac­ti­va­tion of a mech­a­nism that the United States is not in a po­si­tion to ac­ti­vate on its own af­ter leav­ing the agree­ment,” Macron said. “This would un­der­mine the unity of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and the in­tegrity of its de­ci­sions, and it would run the risk of fur­ther ag­gra­vat­ing ten­sions in the re­gion.” Moon Jae-in South Korea’s Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in called for a re­gional in­fec­tious dis­ease con­trol and pub­lic health ini­tia­tive in­volv­ing China, Ja­pan, Mon­go­lia, and North Korea to tackle health crises and lay the foun­da­tion for peace with Py­ongyang. “In the face of the Covid-19 cri­sis that poses a greater threat to hu­man­ity than a war, we came to be acutely re­minded that the safety of neigh­bour­ing coun­tries is di­rectly linked to that of our own,” Moon said. — Al­jazeera/ Sun­day Mail.",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20200911,Should we look East or West for in­spi­ra­tion?,"ONE of Kwame Nkrumah’s fa­mous quote is “We face nei­ther East nor West; We face for­ward.” In re­al­ity, we are a lot like Lot’s wife in­clined to look back and be­come prison­ers of our pasts. Now and then, we lever­age on an an­niver­sary or a New Year to make res­o­lu­tions we strug­gle to ful­fil. As 2020 rolls away, I note that the only res­o­lu­tion I have al­most lived up to is to read a bit more outside my core in­ter­ests. I chose Asia. I picked a few books one of which was “The Dawn of Eura­sia” by Bruno Maçães, a 46-year-old re­searcher and for­mer Por­tuguese Cabinet Min­is­ter. His book builds on the shift of global power, (eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural), to the East. He ar­gues that it is in fact not a shift be­cause that in­flu­ence long resided in the East but drifted West in the past few cen­turies and is now re­vert­ing. It is not his ar­gu­ment that fas­ci­nated me the most in the book but a com­ment he got from Pro­fes­sor Wang Wen of Chongyang In­sti­tute for Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices at Ren­min Univer­sity in China af­ter a pre­sen­ta­tion. “We al­ready knew what your ideas were and we dis­agree,” Wang Wen told him. As a novice in Asian af­fairs, I took the com­ment as sub­tle ad­vice to be cau­tious in be­ing quick to ex­trap­o­late lessons from economies we know lit­tle about. His com­ment came to mind as I read my next book, “The Asian As­pi­ra­tion: why and how Africa should emu­late Asia.” The book has four au­thors: Greg Mills and Emily van der Merwe at The Bren­thurst Foun­da­tion, Nige­ria’s for­mer Pres­i­dent Oluse­gun Obasanjo and Ethiopia’s for­mer Prime Min­is­ter Haile­mariam De­salegn. It comes with lots of ac­co­lades one of which is from the then des­ig­nated MDC pres­i­dent Nel­son Chamisa who de­scribes it as “a tool­kit and man­ual for de­vel­op­ment”. The Fore­word is by Kenya’s for­mer Prime Min­is­ter Raila Odinga who opens thus: “It seems ex­tra­or­di­nary to­day that in the 1960s Sin­ga­pore looked to Africa for in­sights on grow­ing its econ­omy.” The four au­thors’ first lines are “Asia has lifted one bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty in a sin­gle gen­er­a­tion . . . Can Africa be the next Asia? Yes, but only if the con­ti­nent’s lead­ers com­mit to making very dif­fi­cult pol­icy and gover­nance choices . . . it re­quires be­ing sen­si­tive to hu­man rights, democ­racy and the en­vi­ron­ment.” Even with my lit­tle knowl­edge of Asia, I won­dered how they were go­ing to sub­stan­ti­ate such state­ments. The im­por­tant sec­tion in pub­li­ca­tions that of­fer pol­icy rec­om­men­da­tions is the method­ol­ogy. The au­thors base their ini­tial re­view of Africa on a sur­vey by The Bren­thurst Foun­da­tion. The sur­vey sought to de­ter­mine de­vel­op­ment mod­els pre­ferred by Africans, in other words did Africans pre­fer em­u­lat­ing Europe, Asia etc. The au­thors then se­lected 10 Asian coun­tries and tracked their po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment paths. The coun­tries are Ja­pan, Tai­wan, Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, The Philip­pines. Malaysia, In­done­sia, Thai­land, China and Viet­nam. Each coun­try has a ded­i­cated chap­ter af­ter which, is an in­te­grated dis­cus­sion. The au­thors took on too much in this book. Making sense of just one coun­try is daunt­ing. They had 10 and a fur­ther 54 in Africa to dove­tail to dis­cus­sions in the 10. In tak­ing on so much, the book over­looks some fun­da­men­tal growth stim­u­lants in Asia. It is for in­stance un­likely that if the cap­i­tal con­tri­bu­tion of the US through mil­i­tary ar­range­ments in some Asian coun­tries dur­ing the Cold War were to be quan­ti­fied and stripped-out, the resid­ual would still be a siz­zling growth story. We must thus be care­ful in at­tribut­ing some of the coun­tries’ growth solely to do­mes­tic re­sources and poli­cies. Equally tricky is the au­thors’ view that democ­racy comes be­fore eco­nomic growth. This view proves dif­fi­cult to sus­tain con­sid­er­ing that Thai­land for in­stance, is ranked below Zimbabwe on po­lit­i­cal free­dom. In In­done­sia, the au­thors search for sil­ver lin­ings: “Suharto was a mixed bag. Yet for all his ex­cesses, he dra­mat­i­cally im­proved mat­ters … his legacy of the twin prob­lem of cor­rup­tion and big-man rule con­tinue to be­devil the coun­try.” In Tai­wan they note that the coun­try “democra­tised in the 1990s”, well af­ter the growth mo­men­tum was in mo­tion. It is af­ter these in­con­sis­ten­cies to democ­racy-first that the au­thors use the word “prag­ma­tism” more. When China en­ters the dis­cus­sion, part of the con­clu­sion is that “cul­ture, specif­i­cally Con­fu­cian­ism and commitment to hard work and ed­u­ca­tion ex­plain the rapid growth not only in China but across that re­gion”. Should Africa pur­sue democ­racy or prag­ma­tism? That’s dif­fi­cult to an­swer be­cause the au­thors say “one rea­son why Africa has not fol­lowed the Asian de­vel­op­ment story may be its pre­oc­cu­pa­tion un­til now with the Western model, whether with ad­mi­ra­tion or dis­may”. But with the African now aware of an al­ter­na­tive, thanks to the book, it is not clear from the coun­tries the book reviewed, which ide­ol­ogy the African should as­pire to. It can­not be the “prag­ma­tism” in China be­cause, the au­thors say, “the Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence does not of­fer a per­fect model for African gover­nance . . . the vast ma­jor­ity of Africans pre­fer democ­racy to au­toc­racy”. In a webby sort of way, this points the African back to the Western model as the au­thors per­haps in­tended from the very be­gin­ning. The book will en­joy a wide cir­cu­la­tion in Africa. It is easy to read. It is pi­o­neer­ing. Be­cause it is pi­o­neer­ing, its weak­nesses are in-your-face but do not blur its con­tri­bu­tion to pol­icy de­bates. Fur­ther­more, the book of­fers other re­searchers a broad foun­da­tion to un­der­take de­tailed analy­ses on spe­cific poli­cies it men­tions in pass­ing, poli­cies that are likely to have been key growth stim­u­lants to the Asian tigers e.g. spe­cial eco­nomic zones. Africa has few econ­o­mists whose core re­gion of study is not Africa. This means our stu­dents’ cu­rios­ity about other re­gions is rarely whet. As an aca­demic, I find it very strange that stu­dents from else­where of­ten re­search on Africa but rarely ever is it the other way round. How can we progress when all we know is our back­yard? Yet we love draw­ing lessons from the likes of Sin­ga­pore, a com­mend­able ob­ses­sion. But, as we do so, we must heed what we heard at Ren­min Univer­sity hence the need for re­search in­sti­tutes ded­i­cated to study other re­gions.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180831,In­clu­sive­ness key to China-Africa ties,"WHILE glob­al­i­sa­tion draws blame for in­equal­ity, China and African coun­tries are de­ter­mined to forge ahead and build an ex­am­ple of in­clu­sive co­op­er­a­tion in which no par­tic­i­pants will be left be­hind. In a few days’ time, the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FO­CAC) Sum­mit slated for Septem­ber 3-4 in Bei­jing will be “an im­por­tant ac­cel­er­a­tor” to pro­mote China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion. China and Africa are fac­ing both op­por­tu­ni­ties and devel­op­ment chal­lenges and all lead­ers are keen to dis­cuss ways to pro­mote the Sino-Africa re­la­tions. Ob­servers con­sider it a mile­stone event that will fur­ther ce­ment the re­la­tions be­tween a world’s ma­jor econ­omy that rose to suc­cess over the past decades and a con­ti­nent with rapid growth and great po­ten­tial. Through closer ties, the two sides can work to­gether to put for­ward a so­lu­tion to tackle the chal­lenge of un­even and in­suf­fi­cient devel­op­ment fac­ing all coun­tries. It is widely ac­knowl­edged that a gulf still ex­ists be­tween rich and un­der­de­vel­oped coun­tries, known as the NorthSouth gap. Also, devel­op­ment lev­els vary within the same re­gion. But the plight will hope­fully be eased in Africa. As in­vest­ment and trade surge, China is ef­fec­tively shar­ing cap­i­tal, ex­pe­ri­ence, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent with African coun­tries. With roads and fac­to­ries built, the con­ti­nent is fos­ter­ing a stronger en­doge­nous ca­pac­ity to pur­sue a green and pros­per­ous fu­ture. More jobs are now avail­able for lo­cals, and a bet­ter qual­ity of life is on the hori­zon as poverty re­duces steadily. In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion should be the premise of in­clu­sive and the sus­tain­able devel­op­ment of Africa. Chi­nese lead­ers have re­it­er­ated that the coun­try will not fol­low the colo­nial ways of the past, and Africa’s devel­op­ment will not be at the cost of the en­vi­ron­ment or long-term in­ter­ests. With high-stan­dard, win-win co­op­er­a­tion, the two sides will jointly push glob­al­i­sa­tion to­ward a more in­clu­sive path that al­lows even the least de­vel­oped coun­tries to get in­volved in in­ter­na­tional divi­sion of labour and en­joy the ben­e­fits. As un­der­scored by the up­com­ing sum­mit, there is no deny­ing that a great deal has changed in Sino-African re­la­tions since the first FO­CAC sum­mit in 2000. Dur­ing the in­ter­ven­ing years, China has gone from be­ing a rather new and rel­a­tively mar­ginal ac­tor in Africa with a vol­ume of trade worth only a lit­tle more than $10 bil­lion in 2000 to the con­ti­nent’s big­gest eco­nomic part­ner with the to­tal value of ex­ports to the con­ti­nent and im­ports from it amount­ing to more than $170 bil­lion in 2017, a fig­ure that rep­re­sents an in­crease of 14 per­cent from the year be­fore dur­ing a pe­riod when the com­mod­ity price in­dex rose only a mod­est 7 per­cent (af­ter hav­ing slumped in the wake of the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis). The com­mer­cial links are re­in­forced with ex­ten­sive diplo­matic as well as mil­i­tary en­gage­ments. Since it first de­ployed units as part of the United Na­tions peace­keep­ing force in 2003 in Liberia, the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) has grown to be the big­gest con­trib­u­tor among the five per­ma­nent mem­bers of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to blue-hel­meted mis­sions in Africa. In ad­di­tion, since late 2008, the PLA Navy has main­tained a con­tin­ual pres­ence off the con­ti­nent’s eastern lit­toral as part of the in­ter­na­tional ef­fort against So­mali piracy; the cur­rent three-ship task force (two frigates and a sup­ply ship) is the 29th to be de­ployed. Th­ese ex­pe­di­tionary forces have pro­vided the ra­tio­nale for the con­struc­tion of China’s first over­seas mil­i­tary base any­where, a lo­gis­ti­cal fa­cil­ity that opened last year in Dji­bouti, whose prox­im­ity to the largest US in­stal­la­tion in Africa has al­ready cre­ated ten­sions. - Xin­hua. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20201002,Pri­ori­tise lo­cals over Chi­nese con­trac­tors for ben­e­fit of Zim,"KENYAN law pro­fes­sor Pa­trick Lu­mumba gets an­i­mated when he talks about China’s ris­ing in­flu­ence on the African con­ti­nent where gov­ern­ments get blinded by their fra­ter­nal ties with the Com­mu­nist Party to the point of ig­nor­ing de­spi­ca­ble con­ducts of the vis­i­tors, right un­der their noses. Pro­fes­sor Lu­mumba is not re­ally con­cerned about the Chi­nese’s ex­ploita­tive be­hav­iour that thrives be­cause of the dis­unity amongst Africans, but about how African gov­ern­ments re­spond to the in­cur­sions of yet an­other ma­jor power seek­ing to en­gage the con­ti­nent. He, there­fore, ad­vo­cates for bet­ter gov­er­nance by the Africans to en­sure that they ben­e­fit from their en­gage­ment with Bei­jing in terms of trade, in­vest­ments and loans. Con­sid­er­ing how the Chi­nese are be­com­ing a dom­i­nant force in most mega deals in Zim­babwe, this ad­vice must be taken se­ri­ously. An irony of Chi­nese na­tion­als do­ing projects in Zim­babwe is that apart from over­pric­ing their quo­ta­tions and greas­ing palms, they are dab­bling in dis­rup­tive il­le­gal par­al­lel mar­ket ac­tiv­i­ties in or­der to raise for­eign cur­rency (forex) for re­quire­ments that do not qual­ify for the for­eign cur­rency auc­tion trad­ing sys­tem. This is putting pres­sure on forex rates that are the big­gest de­ter­mi­nant of prices in Zim­babwe, which is a net im­porter. Zim­babwe must worry about the “ex­porter curse”, whereby rates spike to lev­els that make it cheaper to im­port fin­ished goods than pro­duce them, like what has hap­pened in Nige­ria, re­sult­ing in a sit­u­a­tion whereby that coun­try’s once thriv­ing tex­tile in­dus­try is to­day a pale shadow of it­self. It also goes with­out say­ing that the forex sourced by the Chi­nese on the black mar­ket ends up be­ing ex­ter­nalised off­shore, thus de­plet­ing the coun­try’s al­ready ten­u­ous forex re­sources. Some will re­call that in March 2018, the au­thor­i­ties pub­lished a list of com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als who ex­ter­nalised forex and Zim­babwe’s “all-weather friends” topped that list. A whoop­ing 114 Chi­nese na­tion­als or com­pa­nies were named out of a to­tal of 157 listed un­der the “spu­ri­ous trans­ac­tions” cat­e­gory, which was dis­puted by Bei­jing’s lo­cal em­bassy. To get hold of scarce forex, some Chi­nese en­trepreneurs are buy­ing Zim­bab­wean raw ma­te­ri­als which they then ex­port to buy­ers in China or Europe in ex­change for Chi­nese ren­minbi. Rings of Chi­nese money-chang­ers spe­cialise in match­ing those need­ing for­eign cur­rency with will­ing Chi­nese buy­ers of Zim­bab­wean im­ports. There are cul­tural ob­sta­cles too. Across the con­ti­nent, Africans are livid with Chi­nese work­ers for re­fus­ing to in­te­grate. Many of them choose to work in un­marked of­fices and dor­mi­to­ries, away from the pry­ing eyes of au­thor­i­ties and po­ten­tial com­peti­tors. They are also known for bring­ing in their own labour, though Chi­nese en­trepreneurs have quickly learnt they need to pro­vide lo­cal em­ploy­ment if they want to stay in busi­ness. This can all be greatly mit­i­gated if projects such as dam con­struc­tion are given to lo­cal con­trac­tors, who have no rea­son to keep their money off­shore or in­sist on ar­range­ments where the lo­cals be­come the sig­nif­i­cant play­ers in the mega deals. African coun­tries, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda are tak­ing mea­sures to cur­tail this lop­sided re­la­tion­ship with China, in­clud­ing seal­ing their bor­ders to avoid im­por­ta­tion of cheap goods, which are de­stroy­ing lo­cal pro­duc­tion. While China was piv­otal in sup­port­ing lib­er­a­tion move­ments across the African con­ti­nent, this is no rea­son to lower our guard and dis­ad­van­tage lo­cals where they have a rea­son­able ex­pec­ta­tion to get the deals done. In re­cent years, we have seen China lin­ing up multi-bil­lion-dol­lar in­vest­ment projects in var­i­ous sec­tors of Zim­babwe's econ­omy, cov­er­ing min­ing, en­ergy, agri­cul­ture, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors. China’s Shang­hai Con­struc­tion Group is cur­rently con­struct­ing a US$140 mil­lion par­lia­ment build­ing in Mount Ham­p­den, 18 kilo­me­tres out­side the cap­i­tal Harare. In 2018, Si­no­hy­dro — a Chi­nese hy­dro power en­gi­neer­ing and con­struc­tion firm — com­pleted an up­grade at Kariba South Hy­dro Power Sta­tion where it in­stalled two gen­er­a­tors with a ca­pac­ity of 150 megawatts (MW) each. The com­pany is also re­fur­bish­ing Zim­babwe’s largest power sta­tion, the Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion, at a cost of US$1,5 bil­lion. In ad­di­tion, China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional be­gan up­grad­ing Zim­babwe’s big­gest air­port, the Robert Gabriel Mu­gabe In­ter­na­tional Air­port in 2018. It is also worth re­mem­ber­ing that the ex­pan­sion of Vic­to­ria Falls Air­port was the re­cip­i­ent of a US$150 mil­lion Chi­nese loan, as was Harare’s US$144 mil­lion re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of its mu­nic­i­pal wa­ter sup­ply and sewage treat­ment. The state-owned fixed line telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions firm TelOne was also a re­cip­i­ent of a loan of US$98 mil­lion to im­prove its fi­bre op­tic net­work. In 2012, the govern­ment an­nounced that China Rail­way would in­vest US$1,2 bil­lion to de­velop a high-speed train route be­tween Harare and Bu­l­awayo. Ad­di­tion­ally, China Africa Sun­light En­ergy Limited has said it plans to in­vest US$2,1 bil­lion de­vel­op­ing coal mines and build­ing two 100MW coal fired plants. Sev­eral fea­si­bil­ity stud­ies have also started be­tween China and Zim­babwe, in­clud­ing stud­ies into coal ex­plo­ration and a 600MW ther­mal sta­tion in Sibugwe, as well as the du­al­i­sa­tion of the Beit­bridge-Harare, Harare-Nyama­panda, Harare-Chirundu and MutareHarare high­ways. It is also dis­turb­ing to note that the Chi­nese are even in­volved in the con­struc­tion of Mbuya Ne­handa’s statue. De­spite her legacy of re­sis­tance, and an un­break­able pride in be­ing African, which even led her to re­fus­ing to con­vert to Chris­tian­ity be­fore her ex­e­cu­tion, Mbuya Ne­handa will not be amused to see that for­eign­ers are tak­ing the lead in the con­struc­tion of her own statue de­spite deaf­en­ing calls for in­di­geni­sa­tion, through what is com­monly re­ferred to as Third Chimurenga. In spite of the acute short­ages of for­eign cur­rency in Zim­babwe, these Chi­nese are paid in real hard cur­rency, which will be wired to their bank ac­counts in Bei­jing, Shang­hai or Bangkok, while lo­cals get pit­tance in RTGS dol­lars. Amid shrill voices warn­ing about the sub­tle re-coloni­sa­tion of Africa (this time by the Chi­nese), Zim­bab­weans have for four decades low­ered them­selves to hew­ers of wood and draw­ers of wa­ter in key projects. Many would re­call that about 33 years ago, the Chi­nese were in­volved in the con­struc­tion of the gi­ant 60 000-seater Na­tional Sports Sta­dium, about seven kilo­me­tres on the western side of cen­tral Harare. The Chi­nese were also in­volved in the con­struc­tion of the US$100 mil­lion Na­tional De­fence Col­lege (NDC) — along the Harare-Ma­zowe Road — in ex­change for di­a­monds mined from the con­tro­ver­sial Marange Di­a­mond Fields, where two Chi­nese firms, An­jin and Ji­nan, were key play­ers. A whop­ping US$15 bil­lion is still un­ac­counted for, af­ter for­mer pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe blew the whis­tle on the eve of his 93rd birth­day in Fe­bru­ary 2016. If it is not Zim­babwe’s so-called “all­weather friends”, who are the Chi­nese, you can be rest as­sured that it would be some other for­eign friends of the rul­ing elite. For ex­am­ple, Mbuya Ne­handa would not be amused to know that even the con­struc­tion of the Na­tional Heroes Acre, where the gal­lant sons and daugh­ters of the Sec­ond Chimurenga war are buried, was done in the 1980s by North Korean firm, Man­su­dae Overseas Projects, and that its ar­chi­tec­tural de­sign re­sem­bles that of the Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Mar­tyrs’ Ceme­tery in Taesong-guyok, just out­side Py­ongyang. In­ter­est­ingly, the North Kore­ans are putting up state-of-the-art in­fras­truc­ture by them­selves. Only last year Kim Jong-un, the North Korean supreme leader, of­fi­cially opened a new town hyped as the “epit­ome of mod­ern civil­i­sa­tion”. The Chi­nese are also do­ing it by them­selves, ap­prov­ing 26 mega in­fras­truc­tural projects last year alone, worth over US$142 bil­lion. Among them is the ChongqingKun­ming high-speed rail­way to be built at a cost of US$20,5 bil­lion. The rail project will see a 699 km high-speed rail­way built be­tween Chongqing and Kun­ming. It will take six years to com­plete the project, in­volv­ing 20 stops, which con­nects Chongqing, Luzhou and Yibin in Sichuan prov­ince, Bi­jie in Guizhou prov­ince, and Zhao­tong, Qu­jing, and Kun­ming in Yun­nan prov­ince. It is hoped the project, which will have a top speed of up to 350km/h, will help lift the western towns and vil­lages out of poverty, while bet­ter con­nect­ing cities in the re­gion. China will also spend US$19,1 bil­lion on the Chengdu ur­ban rail tran­sit phase IV, which has a to­tal of eight ur­ban rail tran­sit lines, with a to­tal length of 176,65km. It will be com­pleted in 2023. As a re­cip­i­ent of Chi­nese as­sis­tance, it is im­per­a­tive that the deals are ne­go­ti­ated in a man­ner that en­sures that lo­cals ben­e­fit and that a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of the loan pro­ceeds is spent lo­cally for the ben­e­fit of the do­mes­tic econ­omy. In this re­gard, there is need to in­vest in build­ing na­tional ne­go­ti­at­ing ca­pac­ity rather than just rely on di­rec­tors within min­istries or the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Of­fice, which are ham­strung in terms of their ca­pac­i­ties. Tap­ping into pri­vate sec­tor ex­perts as well as pub­lish­ing agree­ments is worth con­sid­er­ing for pur­poses of achiev­ing na­tional good.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20151211,China ups Africa com­mit­ment even as both their for­tunes fade,"While China is Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, with two- way flows ex­ceed­ing US$220 bil­lion last year, the con­ti­nent pri­mar­ily ex­ports com­modi­ties, while pur­chas­ing man­u­fac­tured goods. Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa fell by more than 40% in the first half of 2015 as eco­nomic growth in the world’s largest buyer of raw ma­te­ri­als slowed, ac­cord­ing to the Chi­nese Min­istry of Commerce. the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund is fore­cast­ing an eco­nomic ex­pan­sion of 3,8% this year for sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa and 4,3% in 2016, down from 5% last year. “Due to China’s and Africa’s dif­fer­ent eco­nomic struc­tures, there is an im­bal­ance in our trade,” Chi­nese For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Wang Yi told re­porters on Satur­day at the end of the sum­mit. “We can seek over­all eco­nomic bal­ance in­creas­ing in­vest­ment in Africa.” the two-day sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion in South Africa’s com­mer­cial cap­i­tal is the first top-level gath­er­ing to be held in the con­ti­nent since the group­ing was formed in 2000. While trade re­la­tions and de­vel­op­ment projects were top of the agenda, talks also touched on joint se­cu­rity ef­forts, with Xi pledg­ing a US$60 mil­lion grant to sup­port the build­ing and op­er­a­tion of the African Standby Force. “It’s al­most like cap­i­tal is be­ing de­ployed in a coun­ter­cycli­cal fash­ion,” Mar­tyn Davies, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for emerg­ing mar­kets and Africa at Fron­tier Ad­vi­sory Deloitte, said by phone. “A lot of this is sup­port­ive and re­flec­tive of China’s for­eign com­mer­cial pol­icy, en­abling commerce in Africa.” the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment wants to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to help boost in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion in African coun­tries, Vice Min­is­ter of Commerce Qian Kem­ing told re­porters on Satur­day. Cheap la­bor is one of the con­ti­nent’s com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages, he said. African lead­ers at the sum­mit, in­clud­ing Zim­bab­wean Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe and Kenyan Pres­i­dent Uhuru Keny­atta, dis­puted the no­tion that China wants to ex­ploit the con­ti­nent’s min­eral re­sources with no last­ing ben­e­fits for Africa. the com­mit­ments made by Xi “is a clear in­di­ca­tion that China is com­mit­ted to Africa’s de­vel­op­ment agenda on the ba­sis of a win-win part­ner­ship,” Keny­atta told re­porters at the sum­mit on Satur­day. “Here is a part­ner who is leav­ing some­thing be­hind, who is work­ing with us to pull our coun­tries out of poverty.” African coun­tries from Ghana to Zam­bia have been hit by lower com­mod­ity prices and prospect of higher U.S. in­ter­est rates that is driv­ing in­vestors away from riskier as­sets and con­tribut­ing to weaker cur­ren­cies. De­spite the slow­down, four of the ten fastest-grow­ing economies in the world will still be in Africa next year, ac­cord­ing to IMF fore­casts. “the com­pe­ti­tion in China is very tight,” Davies said. “Africa is still fron­tier mar­ket stuff, but prof­its are rel­a­tively high, cor­po­rate prof­its are very high in Africa, and I think the Chi­nese re­al­ize that.”-",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170601,Belt and Road Fo­rum key to free world trade,"THE Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion (BRF) held in Bei­jing, China, mid last month was an eye opener to pro­gres­sive in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion. The fo­rum proved that China is com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing free and in­clu­sive trade, not only for its ben­e­fit, but for the up­lift­ing of the world econ­omy. The mas­sive fo­rum was at­tended by 29 Heads of State and Govern­ment from across the world, as well as lead­ers of key in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. The out­come of the fo­rum is set to change how the world con­ducts its busi­ness, em­pha­sis­ing how in­flu­en­tial China has be­come in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs. The list of de­liv­er­ables from the fo­rum is com­pre­hen­sive, com­pris­ing 76 items and over 270 con­crete re­sults in five key ar­eas. The key ar­eas are pol­icy, in­fra­struc­ture, trade, fi­nan­cial and peo­ple-to-peo­ple con­nec­tiv­ity. The Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt and the 21st-cen­tury Mar­itime Silk Road, also known as the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive or the Belt and Road was pro­posed by the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent and un­veiled in 2013. It fo­cuses on con­nec­tiv­ity and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and other coun­tries fol­low­ing the tra­di­tional routes of trade and co­op­er­a­tion that have ex­isted for cen­turies. The ini­tia­tive links China with all other con­ti­nents, as the Asian coun­try ex­erts its in­flu­ence in global af­fairs and its de­sire to en­sure win-win co­op­er­a­tion in in­ter­state re­la­tions. The im­por­tant co­op­er­a­tion ini­tia­tive is meant to build the Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt and the 21st Cen­tury Mar­itime Silk Road. To date, steady progress and fruit­ful re­sults have been achieved in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the ini­tia­tive and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity has wel­comed it and its pos­i­tive im­pact. The fo­rum held in Bei­jing is a ma­jor in­ter­na­tional event for coun­tries and par­ties con­cerned to en­gage in con­sul­ta­tion on build­ing the Belt and Road and shar­ing the ben­e­fits. It is also an im­por­tant plat­form for the par­tic­i­pat­ing par­ties to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion and syn­er­gise their de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. Be­fore and dur­ing the BRF, na­tional gov­ern­ments, lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and en­ter­prises reached a num­ber of co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments, pol­icy mea­sures and prac­ti­cal re­sults. Through the ini­tia­tive, China wants to en­sure that growth in the world econ­omy is based on com­mon good and that it ben­e­fits all. The ini­tia­tive has al­ready yielded pos­i­tive re­sults. Ac­cord­ing to Chi­nese news agency, Xin­hua, at least 68 coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions have so far signed agree­ments with China on Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion. The to­tal trade be­tween China and other Belt and Road coun­tries ex­ceeded $3 tril­lion be­tween 2014 and 2016, and Chi­nese in­vest­ment in these coun­tries sur­passed $50 bil­lion. A multi-di­men­sional in­fra­struc­ture net­work is tak­ing shape, one that is un­der­pinned by eco­nomic cor­ri­dors fea­tur­ing land-sea-air trans­porta­tion routes and in­for­ma­tion ex­press­ways and sup­ported by ma­jor rail, port and pipeline projects. It is clear that the Belt and Road is set to bring win-win re­sults in the world, and in the process lift mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty, raise liv­ing stan­dards and con­nect the world in a way never be­fore seen. The ini­tia­tive has been most wel­come by en­ter­prises through­out the world which view it as an op­por­tu­nity to build a trade and in­fra­struc­ture net­work con­nect­ing Asia with Europe and Africa, along and beyond the an­cient trade routes. Pres­i­dent Xi made it clear at the fo­rum that the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive does not ex­clude or tar­get any party, and we need to seek win-win re­sults through greater open­ness and co­op­er­a­tion, avoid frag­men­ta­tion, re­frain from set­ting in­hibitive thresh­olds for co­op­er­a­tion or purs­ing ex­clu­sive ar­range­ments, and re­ject pro­tec­tion­ism. This rea­son­ing is set to trans­form how coun­tries treat each other for the mu­tual ben­e­fit of all. Xin­hua quoted Ig­na­cio Martinez Cortes, head of the Re­search Lab­o­ra­tory for Trade, Econ­omy and Busi­ness, as say­ing the BRF strength­ened in­ter­na­tional trade ties and sought new chan­nels of dis­tribut­ing goods to bring about mu­tual ben­e­fit for all. “The ini­tia­tive is the gate­way to in­ter­na­tional free trade and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, and also more fo­cused on in­vest­ment, in­fra­struc­ture and de­vel­op­ment, in­stead of just on trade,” he said. Let’s have a brief look at the de­liv­er­ables of the BRF fo­rum. Un­der syn­er­gise con­nec­tiv­ity of de­vel­op­ment poli­cies and strate­gies, China signed sev­eral mem­o­randa of un­der­stand­ing with many coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme, the United Na­tions In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the United Na­tions Hu­man Set­tle­ments Pro­gramme. The Asian coun­try signed var­i­ous co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments to deepen project co­op­er­a­tion for in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity. These in­cluded agree­ments on in­ter­na­tional trans­porta­tion and strat­egy co­or­di­na­tion and on peace­ful use of nu­clear en­ergy. Agree­ments were also signed to ex­pand in­dus­trial in­vest­ment and en­hance trade con­nec­tiv­ity with many of the gov­ern­ments and or­gan­i­sa­tions rep­re­sented at the fo­rum. The Asian coun­try signed eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments with 30 coun­tries at the fo­rum and jointly is­sued the Ini­tia­tive on Pro­mot­ing Unim­peded Trade Co­op­er­a­tion along the Belt and Road in col­oration with more than 60 coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. One of the im­por­tant de­liv­er­ables of the fo­rum was for en­hanc­ing fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion and pro­mot­ing fi­nan­cial con­nec­tiv­ity. Un­der this ini­tia­tive, the Silk Road Fund was ex­panded by RMB 100 bil­lion ($14,5 bil­lion). China said it will en­cour­age fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to con­duct Over­seas Fund Busi­ness in RMB, with the es­ti­mated amount of about RMB 300 bil­lion ($43,5 bil­lion), pro­vid­ing fi­nanc­ing sup­port for the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. Many other mea­sures in de­vel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tion were out­lined in agree­ments signed with var­i­ous coun­tries and or­gan­i­sa­tions to en­hance fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion. An­other im­por­tant de­liv­er­able was to in­vest more in peo­ple’s liveli­hood and deepen peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­change. China said it will in­crease its as­sis­tance to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries along the Belt and Road and help with emer­gency food aid. The Asian coun­try will pro­vide $1 bil­lion to the South-South Co­op­er­a­tion As­sis­tance Fund to ini­ti­ate the China and United Na­tions 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Co­op­er­a­tion Ini­tia­tive. It will also sup­port the im­ple­men­ta­tion of 100 Happy Home Projects, 100 Anti-Poverty Projects, 100 Health Re­cov­ery Projects and other projects in the rel­e­vant coun­tries. China will pro­vide rel­e­vant in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions with $1 bil­lion to jointly pro­mote the im­ple­men­ta­tion of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion projects ben­e­fit­ing the coun­tries on the Belt and Road, in­clud­ing 100 Refugee As­sis­tance Projects cov­er­ing food, tents and por­ta­ble houses. The coun­try will also set up Refugee Schol­ar­ships, pro­vid­ing 500 refugee young­sters with ed­u­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties and fi­nan­cial sup­port to 100 refugee ath­letes to par­tic­i­pate in re­gional or in­ter­na­tional games. A num­ber of cul­tural ex­change agree­ments were signed while the Chi­nese govern­ment signed as­sis­tance agree­ments with var­i­ous United Na­tions agencies, set­ting the stage for more hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to the world.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191118,Zim can draw many lessons from China,"IN 2001, at the United Na­tions Gen­eral As­sem­bly (UNGA), the for­mer and late UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Kofi An­nan said “HIV has the face of a woman”, and for decades even up to date it still has that face! The more the agenda is moved, the more ado­les­cent girls, young women (AGYW) and women re­main left behind with rates of HIV ac­qui­si­tion amount­ing to 390 000 and 75 per­cent of th­ese from Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa (En­vi­sion for girls UNICEF Data hub). The HIV re­sponse for women and girls in our diversity must be rooted in an in­te­grated ap­proach to ed­u­ca­tion, gen­der eq­uity, poverty erad­i­ca­tion and economic em­pow­er­ment as th­ese all are cen­tral to whether a woman or girl will have health lit­er­acy, abil­ity to ex­er­cise choice, ca­pac­ity to refuse un­wanted sex, re­move the need to ex­change sex “un­wanted” sex for money or goods, and chal­lenge harm­ful cul­tural norms and prac­tices, in­clud­ing child mar­riages and fe­male gen­i­tal mu­ti­la­tion. HIV and ado­les­cent girls and young women need to be well ar­tic­u­lated in the UHC Agenda. What girls want and what women want as com­mit­ments to the HIV pre­ven­tion Agenda in ICPD is a re­newed com­mit­ment to­wards: Ad­vance safety, se­cu­rity, and free­dom from vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing end­ing stigma, dis­crim­i­na­tion, and sex­ual ha­rass­ment, for young women and girls in all our diversity. There must be zero tol­er­ance for any form of sex­ual ha­rass­ment or bul­ly­ing for all em­bed­ded into both or­gan­i­sa­tional pol­icy and cul­ture. En­sure full ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion and ed­u­ca­tion, in­clud­ing com­pre­hen­sive sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion, in­clud­ing pro­vi­sion of men­strual health and hy­giene ser­vices, girls and women friendly qual­ity, com­pre­hen­sive health­care ser­vices. Com­pre­hen­sive sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion is an in­ter­ven­tion that pro­motes self-aware­ness: AGYW seek self- re­as­sur­ance in the wrong places that puts them in harm’s way. llSup­port com­mit­ments that fo­cus laws and poli­cies that pro­mote our ac­cess to sex­ual and re­pro­duc­tive health and rights with­out co­er­cion, age re­stric­tions or re­quire­ments to be ac­com­pa­nied by male guardians. In this day and age, we can­not con­tinue to tol­er­ate the moral­i­sa­tion and crim­i­nal­i­sa­tion of our sex­u­al­ity! This has to come to an end! Strength­ened in­vest­ment in cham­pi­oning our lead­er­ship and eq­uity so that girls and young women in all our diversity are cat­a­lysts for and mean­ing­ful part­ners in pos­i­tive change. We do not need more ex­po­sure we need more re­sources. The agenda is about us, but re­sources are not for us and that needs to change. The re­trac­tion of donors in the HIV re­sponse is real but where is the mo­bil­i­sa­tion of do­mes­tic fund­ing in this equa­tion? A re­search agenda that is driven and led by girls and women tak­ing ac­count of the unique bio-med­i­cal and so­cial con­text of women and girls lives. In­clu­sion and mean­ing­ful en­gage­ment in re­search will en­sure ser­vices that em­brace, re­spect, and re­spond to the pri­or­i­ties, life-long needs, choices, and rights of ado­les­cent girls and women in our diversity. We are com­mem­o­rat­ing ICPD+ 25, 2020 we will be Bei­jing+25, we are a few months into 2020 and the tar­gets un­der the 2016 Po­lit­i­cal Dec­la­ra­tion need to be met. In 2020, it will be five years into the SDGs. Th­ese wa­ter­shed mo­ments for sex­ual and re­pro­duc­tive health, hu­man rights, and gen­der equal­ity are vi­tal to re­flect on as we look to ac­cel­er­at­ing the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals and meet­ing vi­tal tar­gets set for the HIV re­sponse. In my lan­guage we say “rume rimwe harikombe churu” mean­ing that not one man can be able to deal with a sit­u­a­tion sin­gle-hand­edly. We need to all have a col­lec­tive re­newed com­mit­ment, en­ergy, and pas­sion to­wards HIV and SRHR of and for girls and women. ll­lNyasha Phanisa Sit­hole made th­ese re­marks at the Global HIV Pre­ven­tion Coali­tion Min­is­te­rial meet­ing at the ICPD25 Sum­mit in Nairobi, Kenya, on Novem­ber 11 and the Con­cur­rent ses­sion on HIV/ SRHR and young women on Novem­ber 12, 2019 lShe made the re­marks on be­half of ado­les­cent girls, young women and women from 28 Global HIV Pre­ven­tion Coali­tion Coun­tries and Par­tic­i­pants of the Ado­les­cent Girls and Young Women Tech­ni­cal Meet­ing. lTHERE are many pleas­ant scents in the world, but none like pet­ri­chor. When the rains fall on dry soil, the sweet smell is like magic. It is cleans­ing to the soul and ful­fill­ing to the spirit. Pet­ri­chor of­ten marks the start of the rainy sea­son, new life, new be­gin­nings and change. All the creepy crawlies come out of the wood­work. Ants, cen­tipedes, mil­li­pedes and who can for­get fly­ing ter­mites — that sea­sonal del­i­cacy. Earth­worms move long dis­tances, this time above and not in the soil, in an­nual mi­gra­tion, while slimy slugs and snails come out to share the cool air. Frogs come out to hunt the in­sects, snakes to hunt the frogs and owls to hunt the snakes. One feels blessed for be­ing at the top of the food chain. With re­lief, the grass gets green once again and fi­nally, the an­i­mals can feed. The mas­sive change, trans­for­ma­tion of the world around us stim­u­lates in­stinc­tive change in rou­tine. Like all crea­tures, the change in sea­son ig­nites pos­i­tive dis­rup­tion. The winds of change that ac­com­pa­nied the earthy scent in Novem­ber 2017 could not have come at a bet­ter sea­son. The tim­ing was per­fect. Events of that month will re­main for­ever en­graved in the hearts of those who took part or wit­nessed ju­bi­lant scenes on the streets of Zim­babwe’s cap­i­tal, Harare, as tens of thou­sands of protesters marched to de­mand the res­ig­na­tion of for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe. Cor­rup­tion, poor gov­er­nance, po­lar­i­sa­tion and all the other ills that were threat­en­ing to re­verse the gains of in­de­pen­dence could fi­nally be behind us. Our lives as Zim­bab­weans would be changed for­ever. But have we re­ally changed? In public ad­min­is­tra­tion, po­lit­i­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion and na­tion build­ing. Have we changed enough? Last week, two im­por­tant events cen­tral to the restora­tion of economic sta­bil­ity took place. The first was the in­tro­duc­tion of new notes and coins to ease the cash cri­sis, and the sec­ond was the pre­sen­ta­tion of 2020 Na­tional Bud­get pro­pos­als by Fi­nance and Economic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube. No sooner had the new notes and coins been dis­bursed by banks on Tues­day than we saw cash barons parad­ing huge wads of the notes on so­cial media, to the cha­grin of law-abid­ing Zim­bab­weans. OVER the years, the gov­ern­ment of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China has im­ple­mented counter-ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism mea­sures in the au­ton­o­mous re­gion of Xin­jiang. Th­ese mea­sures have proven to be ef­fec­tive and de­vel­op­men­tal to the peo­ple of Xin­jiang who had deeply suf­fered from ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism for the past two decades. Some of th­ese mea­sures have man­aged to bring peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the re­gion and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries can bor­row such mea­sures for the de­vel­op­ment of their coun­tries. Vo­ca­tional Train­ing Vo­ca­tional train­ing in re-ed­u­ca­tion camps has proven to be de­vel­op­men­tal to the re­gion as it has man­aged to bring peace and se­cu­rity. Economic de­vel­op­ment can also be at­trib­uted to this ini­tia­tive as the peo­ple who at­tend the train­ing come out with spe­cial skills which they can use to sus­tain their liveli­hoods and de­velop the econ­omy of the re­gion. Economic eman­ci­pa­tion and re­duc­tion of poverty is one of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s mil­len­nial goals. In 2015, Pres­i­dent Xi set a dead­line of 2020 to erad­i­cate poverty in China, with 850 mil­lion Chinese taken out of ex­treme poverty in the past 40 years. Ac­cord­ing to State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Wang Yi, in the past 64 years since the re­gion was estab­lished, the lo­cal econ­omy has grown by 80 times and tens of thou­sands of lo­cal peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty. Like­wise, the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment, in the past, has ini­ti­ated sim­i­lar projects in an ef­fort of bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion. In 2001, it in­tro­duced the Na­tional Youth Ser­vice, tar­get­ing youths from the ages of 10 ‘‘ Does this mean we have not changed enough to deal with cor­rup­tion? We have not changed enough to en­sure public con­fi­dence in our cur­rency? Did we learn any­thing from the past? The creepy crawlies have come out of the wood­work once more. They have come to feed on the sweat of hard-work­ing Zim­bab­weans who toil with­out func­tional med­i­cal aid or pen­sion schemes, just to put clothes on the backs of their chil­dren. At the top of the cor­rup­tion “food chain” are snakes that oc­cupy high of­fices and have ac­cess to cash. Is it the sea­son of mad­ness? A sea­son that should have ended in Novem­ber 2017, when the Zim­babwe De­fence Forces acted to re­store the legacy of the lib­er­a­tion war. Op­er­a­tion Re­store Legacy did not nab all the crim­i­nals, after all. We need to con­tinue such op­er­a­tions at least not un­til we rid our­selves of self­ish in­di­vid­u­als who do not care that their ac­tions have rip­ple ef­fects on the liveli­hoods of oth­ers. Public con­fi­dence can­not be re­stored as to 30. Its stated pur­pose was to trans­form and em­power youths for na­tion-build­ing through life skills train­ing and lead­er­ship de­vel­op­ment. It also sought to in­cul­cate na­tional val­ues, ethos and ethics into the youths, thereby bring­ing peace, se­cu­rity and de­vel­op­ment to the na­tion. To this day, many vo­ca­tional train­ing fa­cil­i­ties have been opened to help Zim­bab­weans earn a liv­ing through var­i­ous skills. Such train­ing fa­cil­i­ties in­clude Msasa Vo­ca­tional Train­ing Cen­tre, Kaguvi Vo­ca­tional Train­ing Cen­tre and Chi­tung­wiza Vo­ca­tional Train­ing Cen­tre. Reli­gious Free­dom The Xin­jiang Uyghur Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion is largely Mus­lim and be­cause of this ini­tia­tive, the re­gion has en­joyed har­mony amongst its dif­fer­ent eth­nic groups. The Chinese gov­ern­ment has done a good job in not marginal­is­ing any mi­nor­ity group and has taken fur­ther steps to help them achieve reli­gious free­dom by erect­ing sev­eral mosques in the re­gion for those of Mus­lim faith. Ac­cord­ing to the For­eign Min­istry of China, there are now over 28 000 reli­gious sites in Xin­jiang, and close to 30 000 cler­i­cal per­son­nel. Both fig­ures have in­creased 10-fold com­pared with sev­eral decades ago. long as cash barons con­tinue to flaunt their wealth on so­cial media. While a lot has been done in fol­low­ing In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) rec­om­men­da­tions of strength­en­ing the in­de­pen­dence of the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe (RBZ) and im­prov­ing its gov­er­nance con­trols, a lot more still needs to be done. Il­le­gal money chang­ers, wheel­ers and deal­ers, space barons and ten­der­preneurs have be­come he­roes to young peo­ple be­cause they al­ways have bags filled with bricks of cash and drive fancy cars which they park in the mid­dle of the road with­out any reper­cus­sions. Un­less such el­e­ments are dealt with, then we will have a whole gen­er­a­tion of crim­i­nals. In his ac­cep­tance speech at his in­au­gu­ra­tion at the Na­tional Sports Sta­dium on Novem­ber 24, 2017, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa called for col­lec­tive ef­fort in re­build­ing Zim­babwe. “For close to two decades now, this coun­try went through many de­vel­op­ments, he said. While we can­not change the past, there is a lot we can do in the present and fu­ture to give our Na­tion a dif­fer­ent, pos­i­tive di­rec­tion. “I im­plore you all to de­clare that NEVER AGAIN should the cir­cum­stances that have put Zim­babwe in an un­favourable po­si­tion be al­lowed to re­cur or over­shadow its prospects. We must work to­gether, you, me, all of us who make up this Na­tion.” Clearly, some public of­fi­cials have cho­sen not to take heed of the Pres­i­dent’s call, but Nowa­days, ev­ery 530 Mus­lim peo­ple in Xin­jiang have a mosque on av­er­age, which is higher than many Mus­lim coun­tries. In Zim­babwe, the Mus­lim faith has a lim­ited num­ber of be­liev­ers com­pared to other coun­tries in South­ern Africa. The Mus­lim com­mu­nity ac­counts for 0.5 per­cent of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion, with Chris­tian­ity be­ing the dom­i­nant re­li­gion with 84.1 per­cent of the to­tal pop­u­la­tion in Zim­babwe. How­ever, Zim­babwe guar­an­tees free­dom of re­li­gion or be­lief. Sec­tion 60 of the Con­sti­tu­tion of Zim­babwe stip­u­lates that ev­ery per­son has the right to free­dom of re­li­gion or be­lief. The Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe sup­ports all reli­gious sec­tors in any pos­si­ble way. When a new city/town/res­i­dence is be­ing planned, there is al­ways land that is re­served for church/ mosque con­struc­tion. Zim­babwe can draw lessons from China that helps its re­li­gions to build in­fra­struc­ture that is vi­tal for them to con­duct their cler­i­cal ser­vices. Al­lo­cat­ing land alone is not enough as reli­gious sec­tors rely on their con­gre­gants for funds to build the in­fra­struc­ture. Loan fa­cil­i­ties by the Gov­ern­ment should be put in place for the reli­gious sec­tor so that they can be an up­ward tra­jec­tory in con­struc­tion of reli­gious shrines so that cit­i­zens can ex­er­cise to re­main behind in the past that we do not want to re­cur. The anti-cor­rup­tion stance that has been taken by the Pres­i­dent needs sup­port. We all have a part to play. The start­ing point, if you ask me, is re­mov­ing il­le­gal deal­ers in Harare’s CBD. How can we have con­fi­dence in the po­lice when crim­i­nals take over streets in the city cen­tre? When space barons take over park­ing space and col­lect park­ing fees in­stead of the city coun­cil? While the re­cent move by the RBZ in en­sur­ing banks stick to reg­u­lated with­drawal lim­its is com­mend­able, it is not enough. If con­fi­dence in the lo­cal cur­rency is to be re­stored, a lot has to change in the RBZ, banks and streets. The sale of cash can­not be al­lowed to con­tinue. That was nor­mal in the old Zim­babwe. In the new Zim­babwe, reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties do their work. Or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans are not ab­solved from their duty in economic re­con­struc­tion. We all have con­trib­uted to the rot. We must adapt to the de­mands of the new sea­son and hold public of­fi­cials to ac­count. With­out na­tional buy in, no pol­icy can work. Po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences can wait un­til the next elec­tions. The sea­son for cor­rup­tion is over. It ended in Novem­ber 2017 and like the Pres­i­dent said, will never be al­lowed “to re­cur or over­shadow Zim­babwe’s prospects”. Wake up and smell the fall­ing rain, it is called pet­ri­chor; change has come. their right fully. Cit­i­zens Learn­ing the Na­tional Lan­guage In th­ese train­ing cen­tres the res­i­dents of Xin­jiang are taught Man­darin. Man­darin is the of­fi­cial lan­guage of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China. It is widely used across China and other re­gions of the World. It is fast be­com­ing the most widely used lan­guage after English, French and Span­ish. The move by the Chinese gov­ern­ment to teach the res­i­dents of Xin­jiang Man­darin is de­vel­op­men­tal to the re­gion as the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of th­ese lectures will be able to com­mu­ni­cate bet­ter with other re­gions in China. This will also be ad­van­ta­geous to them as they will be able to now be em­ployed out­side Xin­jiang be­cause they can now ef­fec­tively com­mu­ni­cate. Learn­ing a widely used lan­guage is of para­mount im­por­tance as var­i­ous op­por­tu­ni­ties arise by virtue of you know­ing how to con­verse in that lan­guage. China is tak­ing its busi­ness to ev­ery part of the world and be­ing able to speak Man­darin is an added ad­van­tage on one’s Cur­ricu­lum Vi­tae. Zim­babwe has also un­der­taken a sim­i­lar drive in teach­ing Shona and Nde­bele, Zim­babwe’s na­tional lo­cal lan­guages, to all its pri­mary and high school stu­dents. While English re­mains the of­fi­cial lan­guage, Shona and Nde­bele re­main the widely used lo­cal di­alects. The Gov­ern­ment has im­ple­mented th­ese mea­sures to pre­serve the lan­guage and cul­ture of the coun­try. This is a pos­i­tive ini­tia­tive as it pro­motes na­tional ethos and her­itage. Our lan­guage and cul­ture de­ter­mine who we are as a peo­ple and in­tro­duc­ing it to school­child­ren makes them pa­tri­otic cit­i­zens from a ten­der age. A va­ri­ety of the­matic is­sues can arise from the anal­y­sis of Xin­jiang and the mea­sures it has been im­ple­ment­ing in the past decade to counter ter­ror­ism. Some of th­ese is­sues in­clude the im­por­tance or dis­ad­van­tage of sur­veil­lance on cit­i­zens, free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion, hu­man rights, global counter-ter­ror­ism ef­forts and the im­pact of sanc­tions on the de­vel­op­ment of a na­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20201029,Covid-19 not an ex­cuse for fail­ure on cli­mate com­mit­ments: AfDB,"THE African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) says the Covid-19 pan­demic should not be an ex­cuse to re­nege on global cli­mate com­mit­ments in­clud­ing the US$100 bil­lion per an­num for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The Covid-19 pan­demic was first de­tected in China last De­cem­ber and has plagued the rest of the world killing mil­lions of peo­ple. Speak­ing on be­half of AfDB’s pres­i­dent Dr Ak­in­wumi Adesina at the re­cently held vir­tual Africa Re­gional Re­silience Di­a­logue, the bank’s vice pres­i­dent for power, en­ergy and green growth, Mr Kevin Kar­iuki, said the on­go­ing pan­demic has caught ev­ery­body un­aware and ag­gra­vated Africa’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity. “The on-go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic caught ev­ery­body un­aware and has ag­gra­vated Africa’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties, re­vers­ing 10 to 20 years of hard­earned de­vel­op­ment gains,” he said. “We need to build re­silience in the face of this, and fu­ture pan­demics.” The re­gional re­silience di­a­logue was held un­der the theme: “Build­ing Back Bet­ter and Greener: Seiz­ing Trans­for­ma­tion Op­por­tu­ni­ties for Re­silient Fu­ture in Africa”. Mr Kar­iuki used the op­por­tu­nity to high­light AfDB’s con­tin­ued sup­port for the global cli­mate agenda. “Covid-19 should not be a rea­son to re­nege on global cli­mate com­mit­ments, in­clud­ing al­lo­cat­ing $100 bil­lion per an­num for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries by 2020,” he said. “In­stead, tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic should present an op­por­tu­nity to put for­ward au­da­cious mea­sures that will en­able African coun­tries to bounce back bet­ter.” It is against this back­ground that the re­gional fi­nancier timeously es­tab­lished a US$10 bil­lion Covid-19 re­sponse fa­cil­ity, which is sup­port­ing African gov­ern­ments and busi­nesses to mit­i­gate so­cial and eco­nomic im­pact while sup­port­ing green eco­nomic re­cov­ery. Dur­ing the di­a­logue, it was noted that cli­mate change was a threat mul­ti­plier, es­pe­cially in Africa, be­cause it ex­ac­er­bates ex­ist­ing de­vel­op­ment chal­lenges that presently af­fect coun­tries. In the last five years, about 180 mil­lion peo­ple across Africa have been af­fected by ex­treme weather events, with losses and dam­age es­ti­mated at over US$22 bil­lion. The high-level ses­sion was fol­lowed by two pan­els on build­ing re­silience in food and agri­cul­ture sys­tems in Africa and trans­form­ing food and agri­cul­ture sys­tems by se­cur­ing high-level com­mit­ments for re­silience and adap­ta­tion in food and agri­cul­ture sys­tems to en­sure postCovid-19 re­cov­ery that is greener and more in­clu­sive.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201118,US elec­tions: An agenda for Africa,"IALWAYS ex­pected United States Pres­i­dent- elect Joe Bi­den would win and felt that the poll­sters had been so con­sis­tent that they could not be wrong. Oh dear, very few were any­where near the mark. But al­though it was close and was a very tight race, it was clear af­ter three days, that the Bi­den/ Ka­mala Har­ris ticket was go­ing to catch the bus. Don­ald Trump did well, but he was beaten by good old-fash­ioned pol­i­tics. And any­one who felt that the US was at last throw­ing off its bur­dens of slav­ery, civil war and rest of the de­bris that char­ac­terise its his­tory, bet­ter think again. I hope his­tory will show that Trump and his co­horts were an aber­ra­tion and not a con­stant in US pol­i­tics. I saw many par­al­lels be­tween Trump and the late Rhode­sian Prime Min­is­ter Ian Smith regime here in Africa. He was a politi­cian who knew his base like the back of his hand. He spoke for them, he fed their fears and as­pi­ra­tions and was to­tally faith­ful to his peo­ple. They fol­lowed him like lap dogs and be­lieved ev­ery­thing he told them. But he was lead­ing his coun­try into a cul du sac out of which there was only one way and that was back down the road he trod. The one thing his­tory teaches us is that we stand on the shoul­ders of those who went be­fore us and that if we do not care­fully plot our way around the mis­takes of our past, we will re­peat them. In the case of the US, it was their unity as a fed­er­a­tion of States, their will­ing­ness to take in mi­grants from all over the world and then treat them all as Amer­i­cans, that gave the US its present sta­tus in the world. I re­mem­ber my first im­pres­sions of Amer­ica as a vis­i­tor, the la­tent racism, the hard work and in­no­va­tion, the great US en­gi­neer­ing and their gen­eros­ity. The faults were many — most Amer­i­cans have lit­tle or no knowl­edge of the wider world, most have never trav­elled. Then their mas­sive ca­pac­ity as the one re­ally su­per­power in the world. What is the way back? First it is un­der­stand­ing that an iso­la­tion­ist US may be good for the US in the short term, but it is not the roadmap into the fu­ture. In the days be­fore the Sec­ond World War, iso­la­tion­ist poli­cies kept the US out of Euro­pean con­flicts and al­lowed them to de­velop the most ad­vanced econ­omy in the world be­hind the moats of the At­lantic and the Pa­cific Oceans. Pearl Har­bour was a wake-up call in that it smashed the il­lu­sion that the US could con­tinue to de­velop and keep its peace in iso­la­tion. It re­vealed a world in which we all have a stake in each other’s fu­ture. Se­condly, the US is go­ing to have to re­pair the dam­age that Trump has done to the al­liances that have given us the long­est pe­riod of rel­a­tive peace and pros­per­ity in world his­tory. Nato, the Tran­sAt­lantic Al­liance, the United Na­tions sys­tem and the mul­ti­lat­eral agen­cies. The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the trade agree­ments that have pro­vided the foun­da­tion for the most rapid ex­pan­sion in global mar­kets in his­tory, an ex­pan­sion process that has al­lowed bil­lions of peo­ple to claw their way out of absolute poverty and degra­da­tion. In the process, we have cre­ated three new cen­tres of power — China, the Far East and In­dia and the Euro­pean Union — still the largest eco­nomic and trade bloc in the world. Com­bine In­dia, China and Ja­pan and the US no longer looks like a mono­lith. We are feed­ing our world, sup­ply­ing its huge ap­petite for en­ergy and in the process we have done more to cre­ate a world of equal­ity and op­por­tu­nity and to re­duce poverty than any other cen­tury. Then the US is go­ing to have to go back to sci­ence and ra­tio­nal de­ci­sion­mak­ing. We can­not go on as we have been, think­ing that ev­ery­one has the right to the kind of liv­ing stan­dard that the US and Europe have es­tab­lished. We just do not have the re­sources and the un­equal world cre­ated by our very suc­cess, will lay the ground­work for fu­ture con­flict. We need to in­no­vate and change, we need to think and act and do so to­gether. Trump’s with­drawal from the Paris ac­cord will have to be re­versed. So much for the global im­pli­ca­tions — what will be the US agenda for Africa? The first pri­or­ity is to recog­nise that Africa is com­ing of age. This is no longer the post- colo­nial con­ti­nent of sham­bolic lib­er­a­tion pol­i­tics and neo-Marx­ist regimes and the big men syn­drome that dom­i­nated our lives since the colo­nial pow­ers started their with­drawal. Slowly Africa is es­tab­lish­ing a mid­dle class, is start­ing to de­velop sound macro-eco­nomic poli­cies and recog­nis­ing the vi­tal role of the pri­vate sec­tor. My prob­lem with the West it that they do not recog­nise the speed with which th­ese changes are tak­ing place on the ground. Many African cap­i­tals are un­recog­nis­able from what they were 50 years ago. The sec­ond pri­or­ity is to stop mea­sur­ing African demo­cratic norms through the prism of post- colo­nial im­posed con­sti­tu­tional regimes which have al­most all failed. Con­sti­tu­tions crafted in Paris, or Lon­don or Lis­bon bore lit­tle or no un­der­stand­ing of the un­der­ly­ing po­lit­i­cal cul­tures of Africa. They did not un­der­stand the im­por­tance of tribe, re­li­gion or race. They drew on the his­tor­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence of Euro­pean po­lit­i­cal cul­tures based on cen­turies of evo­lu­tion and con­flict. The Euro­pean and Amer­i­can pow­ers look at Africa through a prism of their own mak­ing. They would never make that mis­take in the former colonies of the Soviet Union or in Asia. But they do so in Africa and nowhere more closely than in Zim­babwe. The third pri­or­ity is the recog­ni­tion that Africa has more po­ten­tial than any other con­ti­nent in the world to­day. We have 60% of all the un­der­utilised land, a great deal of the water, we are the last fron­tier for min­er­als and me­tals of all va­ri­eties and the whole world is go­ing to have to make sure that they get part of the cut when it takes place. Africa is also the con­ti­nent with the youngest pop­u­la­tion and has the fastest grow­ing pop­u­la­tion. Th­ese rep­re­sent op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges for ev­ery­one. I would like to think that ev­ery­one un­der­stands the po­ten­tial, but of one thing I am sure, very few un­der­stand the chal­lenges. Just take one which the world knows fully well its im­por­tance — ed­u­ca­tion. African ed­u­ca­tion prior to in­de­pen­dence was widely ig­nored, the Congo came to in­de­pen­dence with a hand­ful of grad­u­ates, Mozam­bique and An­gola the same. The ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem in Rhode­sia was ex­cep­tional for such a small coun­try, but re­stricted to a small mi­nor­ity both black and white. We have all adopted the chal­lenge of universal, free, pri­mary school ed­u­ca­tion — the harsh re­al­ity is that the qual­ity of that ed­u­ca­tion is de­te­ri­o­rat­ing so fast in the State sec­tor in Africa as to be frightening for the fu­ture. I am not in favour of any sort or global com­pe­ti­tion for in­flu­ence and re­sources in Africa, but I do think that we are the first ca­su­alty of US iso­la­tion­ism or even ne­glect. The US has to start get­ting out into the world and com­pet­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties and growth. They abound, but I see no sign of the US wak­ing up to the new sit­u­a­tion. Africa could be the fastest grow­ing part of the world econ­omy in the 21st cen­tury and if you want to play in that league you have to get in­volved on the ground. I know of no African lead­ers who would not wel­come such ini­tia­tives. But we are not go­ing to give up our hard-won sovereignty and in­de­pen­dence or the right to build our coun­tries and in­sti­tu­tions in an African way. I am not ar­gu­ing for an ex­cep­tion or lower stan­dards — just start treat­ing all in­de­pen­dent States equally — whether they are African, Euro­pean or Asian.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20200814,Plung­ing deeper into the abyss,"PRES­I­DENT Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s heavy-handed crack­down in his bid to stop protests by civil rights groups and po­lit­i­cal par­ties over cor­rup­tion and the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing econ­omy, have once again put Zim­babwe un­der the global spotlight for all the wrong rea­sons at a time the coun­try has been on a drive to lure in­vestors into the na­tion. Alarmed by plans to protest on July 31, po­lice ar­rested op­po­si­tion politi­cian and or­gan­iser of the demon­stra­tion Ja­cob Ngarivhume and jour­nal­ist Hopewell Chin’ono for in­cit­ing vi­o­lence. Ap­peals for bail have been un­suc­cess­ful with the two taken to Chiku­rubi Max­i­mum Prison where they are in­car­cer­ated with mur­der­ers and rapists. MDC Al­liance spokesper­son Fadzai Ma­here, award-win­ning au­thor Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga, the nephew of jour­nal­ist Mduduzi Mathuthu, Tawanda Muchehiwa are among those who have also either been ar­rested or tor­tured over protests. MDC Al­liance says 30 of its mem­bers are in hid­ing as the crack­down by the State in­ten­si­fies amid wide­spread con­dem­na­tion from among oth­ers the United Na­tions and the African Union. This has prompted the #Zim­bab­weanLivesMat­ter so­cial me­dia cam­paign against cor­rup­tion and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions in the coun­try. The cam­paign has been en­dorsed by celebri­ties such as Amer­i­can rap­per Ice Cube and Zim­bab­wean born South African rugby player Tendai Mtawarira. Im­ages of the coun­try’s se­cu­rity forces as­sault­ing civil­ians and those of Chin’ono in leg irons, among oth­ers, have gone vi­ral paint­ing the coun­try as a tyran­ni­cal out­post. This could not have come at a worse time, with the coun­try in des­per­ate need for not only fund­ing, but sig­nif­i­cant lev­els of in­vest­ment. Re­cently Fi­nance min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube’s des­per­ate plea to in­ter­na­tional fun­ders for a bailout fi­nan­cial pack­age to ame­lio­rate the im­pact of Covid-19 was re­buffed. Ncube was told in no un­cer­tain terms that no fund­ing was pos­si­ble with­out sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal re­forms. The de­spi­ca­ble hu­man rights abuses by gov­ern­ment as well as its ac­cu­sa­tions that coun­tries such as the United States are be­hind the protests will fur­ther tighten purse strings of fun­ders and in­vestors. Even China which calls Zim­babwe an all-weather friend and strate­gic part­ner, has baulked at giv­ing Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s ad­min­is­tra­tion a bailout pack­age. Form­ing the Zim­babwe In­vest­ment De­vel­op­ment Agency and hol­ler­ing that Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness is woe­fully in­ad­e­quate if Mnan­gagwa’s gov­ern­ment con­tin­ues its hu­man rights abuses. No sane in­vestor will put their money in a coun­try where the rule of the jun­gle reigns supreme. For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment (FDI) fig­ures at­test to this. The coun­try’s FDI lev­els plum­meted from US$ 717,1 mil­lion in 2018 to US$259 mil­lion last year. In­vest­ment is ex­pected to nose­dive fur­ther to a pal­try US$150,4 mil­lion this year. In­vestors’ ap­petite, which has al­ready been di­min­ished by the bizarre sus­pen­sion of the Zim­babwe Stock Ex­change, will only fur­ther dis­si­pate af­ter this lat­est at­tack on hu­man rights. When Mnan­gagwa was sworn in, hope sprung eter­nal that he would usher in a new demo­cratic cul­ture. Just like his pre­de­ces­sor the late Robert Mu­gabe, he has plunged the coun­try into mis­ery and poverty.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190111,Why Africa loves China,"AT THE Septem­ber 2018 Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) in Bei­jing, African Union chair­per­son and Rwan­dan Pres­i­dent Paul Kagame lauded the Chi­nese aid and in­vest­ment strat­egy in Africa as a source of “deep trans­for­ma­tion”. Kagame ar­gued that the co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa is based on mu­tual re­spect and is for the ben­e­fit of both part­ners. This sen­ti­ment is per­haps shared by most African heads of states and govern­ments if their at­ten­dance of the sum­mit is any­thing to go by. How­ever, de­spite the African lead­er­ship’s em­brace of China as a val­ued part­ner, the view that Bei­jing is a “preda­tory” ac­tor in Africa, at­tempt­ing to re­colonise the con­ti­nent is also ubiq­ui­tous in for­eign pol­icy cir­cles, me­dia nar­ra­tives and academia. Africa sees China dif­fer­ently than the West The China-Africa re­la­tion­ship is cur­rently be­ing in­ter­preted through two di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed per­cep­tions. The first of the two is a Sino-pho­bic one, mostly adopted in the West. For in­stance, in a re­cent pol­icy brief­ing at the Her­itage Foun­da­tion, US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser John Bolton crit­i­cised China’s ac­tions in Africa and claimed the con­ti­nent had fallen vic­tim to Bei­jing’s new colo­nial­ism. Just like the US, other Western govern­ments, such as the UK and France, also see China’s en­gage­ment in Africa as a cause for con­cern. For them, China is a spoiler of peace in oil-rich coun­tries such as South Su­dan and Su­dan, and a sup­porter of despots in African coun­tries, such as Gabon. More­over, they per­ceive China as a re­source and en­ergy-hun­gry giant, an ex­ploiter of cor­rupt and in­com­pe­tent govern­ments, a trade op­por­tunist, and a mas­sive pol­luter of the African en­vi­ron­ment. The sec­ond and op­pos­ing per­cep­tion of the part­ner­ship be­tween Bei­jing and Africa is a pro-China one. This view is adopted mostly in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to the pro­po­nents of this nar­ra­tive, China is a saviour — a trust­wor­thy ally of Africa. They view China, a coun­try that does not have a his­tory of colo­nial as­pi­ra­tions in Africa, as a part­ner which could pro­vide much-needed fund­ing with­out any strings at­tached. They also be­lieve Bei­jing un­der­stands and re­spects Africa’s pri­or­i­ties. More­over, China has a rep­u­ta­tion among African coun­tries for be­ing an ac­tor that re­spects other cul­tures and states. This view is widely held by many African heads of state. Much of the aca­demic lit­er­a­ture on the China-Africa part­ner­ship un­jus­ti­fi­ably per­pet­u­ates the Sino-pho­bic nar­ra­tive. The me­dia also wrongly por­trays China as a preda­tory ac­tor in Africa. For in­stance, while it is widely re­ported that China in­vests more in the ex­trac­tive in­dus­try than in other sec­tors, the fact that the ex­trac­tive in­dus­try amounts only to one-third of the to­tal Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa is barely men­tioned. The other two-thirds of China’s in­vest­ment in Africa is in in­fra­struc­ture, con­struc­tion, elec­tric­ity pro­duc­tion, man­u­fac­tur­ing and fi­nance. In fact, com­pared with the US and other de­vel­oped coun­tries, China’s share in ex­trac­tive in­vest­ments in Africa, in the form of min­ing, for ex­am­ple, is lower. Africa is not a vic­tim of Chi­nese “coloni­sa­tion” The Sino-pho­bic nar­ra­tive cham­pi­oned by the West por­trays African na­tions as pas­sive col­lab­o­ra­tors, as mere vic­tims of a sec­ond “coloni­sa­tion” wave. How­ever, this is not the case. Africans are well aware of the short­com­ings of Chi­nese as­sis­tance and busi­ness in Africa — from an im­bal­ance in trade to hefty debt, from poor qual­ity goods to cor­rupt prac­tices. Africans also know that many Chi­nese in­vestors lack con­sid­er­a­tions of sus­tain­abil­ity and that some busi­ness deal­ings are in some in­stances in­com­pat­i­ble with the na­tional in­ter­ests of African coun­tries. Fur­ther­more, Africans recog­nise that Chi­nese busi­nesses rarely fight cor­rupt prac­tices and seek to avoid ac­count­abil­ity. Africans ex­pect China to take some re­spon­si­bil­ity for some of these short­com­ings, but also ac­knowl­edge that the weak­nesses of African reg­u­la­tory and en­force­ment mech­a­nisms, as well as self-serv­ing govern­ments, are the main cul­prits. They know that Chi­nese com­pa­nies, like many oth­ers, ex­ploit the weak­nesses of African states for their ad­van­tage. They be­lieve it is their own govern­ments, and not China, that need to make sure Africa is not ex­ploited. As a re­sult, Africans see the Western crit­i­cisms of the China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion with se­ri­ous reser­va­tions. At the FOCAC meet­ing in Septem­ber, South African Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa sum­marised the African po­si­tion by say­ing that Africa “re­futes the view that a new colo­nial­ism is tak­ing hold in Africa as our de­trac­tors would have us be­lieve”. Why Africa loves China The debt trap is not an in­evitable out­come of loans: As Pres­i­dent Kagame said, the out­come “de­pends on us Africans”. The key fac­tor that de­ter­mines the suc­cess of Chi­nese loans to Africa is whether or not African govern­ments use such loans for pro­duc­tive cap­i­tal in­vest­ment. For these in­vest­ments to suc­ceed, African govern­ments need to be accountable to the peo­ple of Africa. This is not the re­spon­si­bil­ity of China or any other non-African coun­try, for that mat­ter; rather it is Africans who are re­spon­si­ble to en­sure ac­count­abil­ity. There are some ob­vi­ous rea­sons that make China a pre­ferred part­ner for Africa. For Africans, China has four ma­jor at­trac­tions: Unconditional soft loans and ac­cess to cap­i­tal; quick de­liv­ery of ser­vices and cheap goods; fund­ing of peace­keep­ing; and an al­ter­na­tive devel­op­ment model. First, China’s unconditional co­op­er­a­tion has al­lowed African govern­ments to en­joy ac­cess to fi­nance, ex­per­tise and devel­op­ment aid. In 2016, the trade be­tween China and Africa reached $128bn, a dras­tic surge from $1bn in 1980. At FOCAC in Bei­jing this year, China of­fered $60 bil­lion for devel­op­ment fi­nanc­ing un­til 2021. While the fi­nan­cial crises in the US and EU lim­ited their in­vest­ments in Africa, China com­mit­ted to in­vest­ing more in the con­ti­nent. Chi­nese soft loans have en­abled many African govern­ments to avoid pres­sure from global gov­er­nance in­sti­tu­tions such as IMF and World Bank to meet Western norms of ac­count­abil­ity and con­di­tion­al­ity re­lated to po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic re­forms, such as the in­fa­mous struc­tural ad­just­ment that does not al­ways serve the in­ter­est of Africans. Sec­ond, China has aided African govern­ments to meet their peo­ple’s rapidly grow­ing de­mands for ser­vices and in­fra­struc­ture more quickly. Many peo­ple in Africa are now used to quick de­liv­ery of ser­vices — such as trans­porta­tion, ed­u­ca­tion, health and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion — by Chi­nese com­pa­nies. This has cre­ated, and will con­tinue to cre­ate, more ap­petite for Chi­nese busi­ness in Africa. Third, China is now also en­gaged in peace and se­cu­rity projects in Africa. Chi­nese troops par­tic­i­pate in eight UN peace­keep­ing mis­sions of which five are in Africa. More­over, China is the sec­ond largest fi­nan­cial con­trib­u­tor to UN peace­keep­ing mis­sions and it also con­trib­uted fund­ing to the African Union Mis­sion in So­ma­lia (AMISOM) and the IGAD South Su­dan me­di­a­tion. Fourth, China’s his­tory of fast and suc­cess­ful eco­nomic growth is a model from which many lessons could be learned in Africa. China’s ca­pac­ity to en­sure pol­icy sovereignty re­mains rel­e­vant, and highly at­trac­tive to African lead­ers and schol­ars. Ac­cord­ing to the World Bank, in about 40 years, China has lifted about 800 mil­lion peo­ple out of poverty through its un­tra­di­tional path of devel­op­ment. No­tably, it has achieved many of the Mil­len­nium Devel­op­ment Goals. Africans should take a page from China’s play­book on devel­op­ment and sovereignty. They can keep their home in or­der and also make the best out of the com­pe­ti­tion be­tween great powers and re­gional play­ers whether they are from the West, Far East or the Mid­dle East. As things stand, China is al­ready winning the hearts and the minds of Africans. The West will have to ei­ther change tact or for­ever play catch up. — Al Jazeera.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171106,The rise and rise of China,"CHINA is fast grow­ing as a lead­ing global power, as the Euro-Amer­i­can-Ja­panese em­pire is on de­cline. The im­pli­ca­tions for Africa are huge. Ul­ti­mately, it is up to African gov­ern­ments to shape China’s power in ways that will ben­e­fit their peo­ple. The be­gin­ning of a third rev­o­lu­tion­ary epoch? As I wrote this es­say, the Western me­dia was awash with the news of the week-long 19th Congress of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party that started on Oc­to­ber 18. CNN - Hong Kong (Oc­to­ber 17) wrote: “At the congress, Xi may ce­ment his stand­ing by re­vis­ing the party char­ter to in­clude ‘Xi Jin­ping Thought’ as one of the party’s guid­ing the­o­ries, el­e­vat­ing his stature to that of Chair­man Mao Ze­dong”. A num­ber of ar­ti­cles (among them the Bri­tish Guardian) have talked about Congress ush­er­ing in a “third epoch” in Chi­nese re­cent his­tory. The first epoch was Mao Tse-tung, the “Lenin” of China; fol­lowed by Deng Xiaop­ing, who brought an era of “So­cial­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics”, which (in my view) is re­ally “cap­i­tal­ism with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics.” Now we are wit­ness­ing the be­gin­ning of “the Xi Jin­ping era”. The Econ­o­mist dubbed the Congress as a “corona­tion” of Xi Jin­ping. Be­fore we get deeper into this, we need to put the 19th Congress in a proper his­tor­i­cal and geopo­lit­i­cal con­text, in or­der, es­pe­cially, to un­der­stand the im­pli­ca­tions of the rise of China for Africa and for the peo­ples of the global South. China — a re­luc­tant gi­ant For five cen­turies the West has ruled the world. It is now broadly recog­nised that the Euro-Amer­i­can Em­pire is col­laps­ing, and the power that is grad­u­ally but surely neu­tral­is­ing the Em­pire is China. China’s rise is pal­pa­ble. This wor­ries the West, es­pe­cially the United States which is a Pa­cific Ocean na­tion as well as At­lantic. With its US “hub-and-spoke” strat­egy for Asia, the USA has been as­sur­ing its strate­gic part­ners across the Pa­cific that it is the only coun­try (and, Ja­pan, its ally in the Pa­cific) that can pro­vide them se­cu­rity against China. But this is only partly true; most of the Asi­atic coun­tries know of the wan­ing power of the United States and Ja­pan, and are hedg­ing their bets be­tween the US and China. Strange as it may sound, China is not re­ally keen to take over from the United States. It is not ready to pro­vide global po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship. Pres­i­dent Xi says China still needs an­other two decades to “catch up” with the West, and to ad­dress the se­ri­ous prob­lems of poverty and in­equal­ity that still plague its coun­try­side. At the Com­mu­nist Party’s 95th an­niver­sary, July 2016, Xi had pledged to re­turn to Marx­ist roots. “I’m afraid the prop­er­tied classes have taken over,” he said, “the poverty gap is gen­er­at­ing class ten­sions”. So, China’s first pri­or­ity is to ad­dress class con­tra­dic­tions within the coun­try. But the prob­lem is that the Euro-Amer­i­can-Ja­panese Em­pire is col­laps­ing faster than China had ex­pected. At the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s 2017 Davos Con­fer­ence Pres­i­dent Xi more or less said that the USA is no longer able to sta­bilise the world, and so China has to take over the lead­er­ship, even when it has its own in­ter­nal chal­lenges to ad­dress. Chi­nese al­ter­na­tive to the present Western or­der In our times, com­pet­ing ideas about con­tem­po­rary “or­der” and its moral ba­sis ar­tic­u­lated by po­lit­i­cal thinkers and pol­icy strate­gists from Cuba, Iran, China, Rus­sia and Africa are in many ways fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent from those of the “main­stream” Euro-Amer­i­can think­ing. And even if they share some com­mon val­ues — hu­man rights, for ex­am­ple, or good gov­er­nance — their ap­pli­ca­tion in con­crete sit­u­a­tions raises se­ri­ous ques­tions for de­bate. That is why the West con­tin­u­ously talks about bring­ing coun­tries like Cuba, Iran and Zim­babwe “back to or­der”. China, too, has a dif­fer­ent con­cep­tion of “or­der” and mo­ral­ity, and it chal­lenges the main­stream con­cep­tions on is­sues such as hu­man rights and gov­er­nance. But be­cause of its size and power China can with­stand Western sanc­tions bet­ter than Cuba, Iran or Zim­babwe. At the 7th Strate­gic and Eco­nomic Di­a­logue be­tween the United States and China in Bei­jing in June 2015, among other mat­ters, the two coun­tries dis­cussed cli­mate change, cy­ber se­cu­rity code of con­duct, pro­tec­tion of oceans, and com­bat­ing wild life traf­fick­ing. But more im­por­tantly, China said that the in­ter­na­tional or­der needs “new norms” based on co­op­er­a­tion, not con­fronta­tion. China calls for “re­spon­si­ble” co­op­er­a­tion be­tween the two as “equal part­ners” to build a new in­ter­na­tional or­der. The US gave lip-ser­vice to the idea of “co-op­er­a­tion”, but in re­al­ity it is fol­low­ing pol­icy of “con­tain­ment” — much like it did in re­spect of the Soviet Union dur­ing the “cold war” era. The US has heavy mil­i­tary pres­ence in the China Sea, and strong ties with Ja­pan and South Korea. In South Korea alone, there are 28 500 Amer­i­can sol­diers, sailors, air­men and Marines. China is set­ting “new norms” of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions — which it calls in typ­i­cally di­alec­ti­cal note — the “new nor­mal norms”. Whilst chal­leng­ing the “old norms”, it has gone about it sub­tly, set­ting up new struc­tures of global gov­er­nance to the IMF, the World Bank and the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO). It would be in­ter­est­ing to study how China chal­lenges the WTO at its eleventh Min­is­te­rial Con­fer­ence in Buenos Aires in De­cem­ber 2017. An African per­spec­tive on the rise of China Be­tween 2001 and 2011, to­tal trade (ex­ports + im­ports) be­tween Africa and BRIC (Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China) grew from US$22,9 bil­lion to US$267,9 bil­lion. Al­though for Africa, tra­di­tional trade part­ners such as Europe and the US re­main im­por­tant, Brazil, In­dia and China to­gether bought a quar­ter of Africa’s ex­ports in 2013. China is Africa’s top busi­ness part­ner, with trade ex­ceed­ing US$198,5 bil­lion — com­pared with US-Africa trade amount­ing to US$99,8 bil­lion in 2013. This, by any ac­counts, is an in­ter­est­ing de­vel­op­ment. This has pro­voked some heated dis­cus­sion in the West, where the China-bash­ers por­tray China as a rogue dragon. Last year, I was in­ter­viewed by a free­lance jour­nal­ist sym­pa­thetic to Africa, Hans Wet­zels, who ex­pressed the con­cerns that some Africans and Euro­peans have about the Chi­nese pres­ence in Africa. He asked me sev­eral ques­tions, among them: 1. What is your opin­ion on the grow­ing pres­ence of China in Africa? Is this the way South-South co­op­er­a­tion should be set up, or is China yet an­other em­pire ready to ex­ploit Africa? 2. While trav­el­ling around An­gola, I saw empty Chi­nese-built build­ings, (Pres­i­dent Ed­uardo) Dos San­tos and his com­pan­ions mak­ing a load of money off sell­ing oil to China while the slum-dwellers in Luanda are still drained of any per­spec­tive of de­vel­op­ment. That “oil for in­fra­struc­ture” model does not seem like a model lead­ing to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Do you agree? 3. One of the main dif­fer­ences peo­ple point out be­tween China and Western pow­ers in Africa is that China never med­dles in do­mes­tic af­fairs while the West brings an en­tire agenda (an agenda you have called im­pe­ri­al­ist and oth­ers have dubbed pa­ter­nal­is­tic). Is this cor­rect? And do you fore­see China be­com­ing more po­lit­i­cal in the fu­ture as the coun­try gains in power and will that change the re­la­tion­ship with Africa? I will not an­swer these ques­tions here, ex­cept to say that whilst some Africans have gen­uine con­cerns, Western anx­i­ety about Chi­nese pres­ence in Africa tells more about the fail­ure of their model of de­vel­op­ment than about China. Yuzhou Sun, a DPhil stu­dent at Ox­ford, ar­gues that stu­dents on Africa-China re­la­tions are caught up in an epis­te­mo­log­i­cal chal­lenge — a prob­lem­atic ten­dency to­wards over­sim­pli­fied “dragon in the bush”, a “mono­lithic Chi­nese dragon in an un-var­ie­gated African bush stripped of his­tor­i­cal and po­lit­i­cal con­tent.” Of course, there are peo­ple in the West who see the Chi­nese pres­ence in a pos­i­tive light. In “The Dragon’s Gift: The Real Story of China in Africa”, Deb­o­rah Brautigam, ar­gues that Africa and China are in a “win-win” re­la­tion­ship. The book is based on years of re­search trav­el­ling around Africa, vis­it­ing Chi­nese-funded projects cut­ting across agri­cul­ture, in­dus­try, nat­u­ral re­sources, and gov­er­nance. She ends with a sound ad­vice to Africans and the West. “Ul­ti­mately, it is up to African gov­ern­ments to shape this en­counter in ways that will ben­e­fit their peo­ple. The West can help by gain­ing a more re­al­is­tic pic­ture of China’s en­gage­ment, avoid­ing sen­sa­tion­al­ism and para­noia, ad­mit­ting our own short­com­ings, and per­haps ex­plor­ing the no­tion that China’s model of con­sis­tent non-in­ter­ven­tion may be prefer­able to a China that reg­u­larly in­ter­venes in other coun­tries’ do­mes­tic af­fairs, or uses mil­i­tary force to fos­ter po­lit­i­cal change.” As an African, I share some of the con­cerns about China in Africa, and I’ve chal­lenged African gov­ern­ments to tune up their ne­go­ti­at­ing skills with China (as also with Europe, the US or In­dia). There is no rea­son, for ex­am­ple, why China should bring its work­ers for Chi­na­funded con­struc­tion projects in Africa, nor why the Chi­nese should set up small shops — a sec­tor best de­vel­oped by Africans them­selves. Brautigam is cor­rect to ar­gue that “ul­ti­mately, it is up to African gov­ern­ments to shape this en­counter in ways that will ben­e­fit their peo­ple”. This said, I would add that for Africa and for coun­tries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Iran, the Chi­nese model is bet­ter than the Western. Tak­ing a step fur­ther at a global geopo­lit­i­cal level, I would ar­gue that Africa should take ad­van­tage of the BRICs group­ing — es­pe­cially China — to bal­ance the power of the Amer­i­can-Euro­pean-Ja­panese Em­pire that presently dom­i­nates Africa. Tur­key in this re­spect pro­vides a good per­spec­tive; Pres­i­dent Er­do­gan is adroitly turn­ing away from the West. He may, for ex­am­ple, join the Shang­hai Cor­po­ra­tion led by China and Rus­sia. Africa should take a leaf from Er­do­gan’s book. Con­clu­sion In con­clud­ing this es­say, I can­not re­sist the temp­ta­tion of quot­ing from Ami­tav Ghosh’s novel, “Sea of Pop­pies”, where the Bri­tish agent, Burn­ham, who is in the busi­ness of grow­ing opium in In­dia and ex­port­ing it to China, says: “I see no rea­son why an English­man should abet the Manchu tyrant in de­priv­ing the peo­ple of China of opium”; and, in a wish­ful think­ing that the demise of China is for good, he says: “Johnny Chi­na­man thinks he can re­turn to good old days . . . no longer, he has tasted opium”. Things have changed. China is fast emerg­ing as the lead­ing na­tion. This is a re­al­ity even the West can­not ig­nore, let alone Africa. —",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180925,Un­pack­ing China’s re­source diplo­macy,"CHINA’s ac­cel­er­at­ing eco­nomic might and unique po­lit­i­cal and so­cial syn­er­gies have over the past decade been ful­fill­ing a de­bate on the pos­si­bil­ity of a seis­mic geopo­lit­i­cal shift in the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem. In the case of Africa, China is ex­plor­ing its eco­nomic for­eign pol­icy it refers to as eco­nomic diplo­macy. The term eco­nomic diplo­macy lacks a widely ac­cepted def­i­ni­tion. Some na­tions de­scribe China’s eco­nomic diplo­macy as a covert form of neo-colo­nial­ism. As such, China’s re­source diplo­macy to Africa is per­ceived in dif­fer­ent ways and views. China states that its eco­nomic diplo­macy is all about en­gag­ing in busi­ness and claims not to med­dle into in­ter­nal af­fairs of any na­tion. Through its eco­nomic diplo­macy, China is fi­nanc­ing African states. The fi­nanc­ing in­cludes grants, zero-in­ter­est loans, debt relief, con­ces­sional loans, pref­er­en­tial ex­port cred­its, mar­ket rate ex­port buy­ers’ cred­its and com­mer­cial loans from Chi­nese banks. The mil­lion-dol­lar is­sue is on whether the Chi­nese en­gage­ment shall yield neg­a­tive or pos­i­tive eco­nomic re­sults to the African con­ti­nent in the fu­ture? Western coun­tries have pro­vided con­di­tional help to African na­tions. Chi­nese help has come with less or with­out con­di­tion­al­ity. China has man­aged to in­crease the in­de­pen­dence of African pol­icy mak­ing and di­min­ish the idea of devel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tion by ex­pand­ing the sources of FDI and aid avail­able to poor coun­tries. China, like other emerg­ing donors, is ex­pand­ing poorer na­tions’ al­ter­na­tives in procur­ing cap­i­tal. The idea that China is not propo­si­tion­ing Africa to fol­low or im­i­tate its devel­op­ment strat­egy is a re­flec­tion of Chi­nese flex­i­bil­ity on the het­ero­dox na­ture of eco­nomic devel­op­ment from the West donors who have the au­dac­ity to pre­scribe pol­icy to African sov­er­eign states. China is rather boost­ing the psy­cho­log­i­cal es­sen­tials of a devel­op­ment mind set - the free­dom and re­spon­si­bil­ity of African states in set­ting pri­or­i­ties in eco­nomic pol­icy for­mu­la­tion. Due to African coun­tries’ sense of depen­dency on de­vel­oped na­tions, de­vel­oped na­tions of­ten use a strate­gic threat of sus­pend­ing bi­lat­eral as­sis­tance pro­grammes to force com­pli­ance by African States. Zim­babwe is a good case study. The Amer­i­cans and the Euro­pean Union im­posed sanc­tions on Zim­babwe mainly be­cause of the land re­form pro­gramme. African na­tions are looked down upon when it comes to of­fer­ing mean­ing­ful is­sues for dis­cus­sion to the ta­ble. African coun­tries of­ten go to the ta­ble with an er­ro­neous be­lieve that their best al­ter­na­tive to a ne­go­ti­ated agree­ment would au­to­mat­i­cally be worse off than the sta­tus quo, even when ev­i­dence points to the con­trary. The fact that China is af­firm­ing the wide­spread de­mand for African com­modi­ties sug­gests that it could be in­creas­ing African coun­tries’ strate­gic re­sources for ne­go­ti­a­tions and thus boost Africa’s eco­nomic diplo­macy. Africans can now see them­selves as com­ing to the ta­ble to ne­go­ti­ate and not to be in­structed. The premium of African re­sources rep­re­sents a valu­able ne­go­ti­a­tion re­source. By em­pow­er­ing African economies and na­tional agen­cies, China is di­min­ish­ing an ap­a­thetic at­ti­tude to com­mer­cial ne­go­ti­a­tions by African coun­tries and re­duce African coun­tries’ dis­po­si­tion to con­cede too read­ily in eco­nomic ne­go­ti­a­tions. In this way, China’s re­source diplo­macy can never be re­garded as detri­men­tal to fu­ture African devel­op­ment. For­mer Sene­galese Pres­i­dent Ab­doulaye Wade has this to say per­tain­ing to China-Africa busi­ness re­la­tion: “. . . the Chi­nese model for stim­u­lat­ing rapid eco­nomic devel­op­ment has much to teach Africa. With direct aid, credit lines and rea­son­able con­tracts, China has helped African na­tions build in­fra­struc­ture projects in record time - bridges, roads, schools, hos­pi­tals, dams, leg­isla­tive build­ings, sta­di­ums and air­ports. “In many African na­tions, in­clud­ing Sene­gal, im­prove­ments in in­fra­struc­ture have played im­por­tant roles in stim­u­lat­ing eco­nomic growth. . . . It is a telling sign of the post-colo­nial mind­set that some donor or­gan­i­sa­tions in the West dis­miss the trade agree­ments be­tween Chi­nese banks and African states that pro­duce these vi­tal im­prove­ments - as though Africa was naïve enough to just off­load its pre­cious nat­u­ral re­sources at bar­gain prices to ob­tain a com­mit­ment for an­other sta­dium or state house. . . . I have found that a con­tract that would take five years to dis­cuss, ne­go­ti­ate and sign with the World Bank, takes three months when we have dealt with Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties. “I am a firm be­liever in good gov­er­nance and the rule of law. “But when bu­reau­cracy and sense­less red tape im­pede our abil­ity to act - and when poverty per­sists while in­ter­na­tional func­tionar­ies drag their feet - African lead­ers have an obli­ga­tion to opt for swifter so­lu­tions.” Re­cently Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa was in China and signed de­vel­op­men­tal deals with the Chi­nese. The deals shall see more Zim­bab­weans be­ing em­ployed and the econ­omy shall be im­proved for the bet­ter­ment of the or­di­nary per­son in the coun­try. China is in­deed prov­ing to be a bet­ter friend to lean on for many African states be­cause of its for­eign poli­cies.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190426,"The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive Progress, Con­tri­bu­tions and Prospects 2019","Mu­seum Al­liance, Net­work of Silk Road Arts Fes­ti­vals, Silk Road In­ter­na­tional Li­brary Al­liance, andSilk Road In­ter­na­tional Al­liance of Art Mu­se­ums and Gal- leries have been es­tab­lished. China, CEE coun­tries, ASEAN coun­tries, Rus­sia, Nepal, Greece, Egypt, and South Africa have hosted ac­tiv­i­ties to cel­e­brate the cul­tures of B&R coun­tries in dif­fer­ent years, and de­vel­oped about a dozen cul­tural ex­change brands such as the “Silk Road Tour” and “Chi­nese/African Cul­tures in Fo­cus”. Ma­jor cul­tural festi- vals and ex­pos have been launched such as the Silk Road (Dun­huang) In­ter­na­tional Cul­tural Expo, Silk Road In­terna- tional Arts Fes­ti­val, and Mar­itime Silk Road In­ter­na­tional Arts Fes­ti­val, and 17 Chi­nese cul­ture cen­ters have been set up in B&R coun­tries. China has signed co­op­er­a­tion agree- ments on the pro­tec­tion of cul­tural her­itage with In­done­sia, Myan­mar, Ser­bia, Sin­ga­pore, and Saudi Ara­bia. Through a com­bined ef­fort from China, Kaza­khstan and Kyr­gyzs­tan, Silk Roads: The Routes Net­work of Chang’an-Tian Shan Cor­ri­dor has be­come a UNESCO World Her­itage site. Steady progress has been made in the Belt and Road News Al­liance. The Silk Road NGO Co­op­er­a­tion Net­work, with 310 mem­bers, has be­come an im­por­tant plat­form for non- gov­ern­men­tal co­op­er­a­tion. 2) Fruit­ful re­sults in ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing. The Chi­nese Govern­ment Schol­ar­ship – Silk Road Pro­gram has been set up, and China has signed agree­ments with 24 B&R coun­tries on the mu­tual recog­ni­tion of higher ed­u­ca­tion de- grees. In 2017, 38,700 stu­dents from other B&R coun­tries stud­ied in China on schol­ar­ships pro­vided by the Chi­nese govern­ment, ac­count­ing for 66 per­cent of all stu­dents re­ceiv- ing such schol­ar­ships. Other B&R schol­ar­ships are pro­vided in the Hong Kong and Ma­cao SARs. China has opened 153 Con­fu­cius In­sti­tutes and 149 Con­fu­cius Class­rooms in 54 B&R coun­tries. The Chi­nese Academy of Sciences of­fers schol­ar­ships in Mas­ter’s and Doc­tor­ate pro­grams to other B&R coun­tries, and runs sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy train­ing cour­ses which have trained some 5,000 stu­dents from other B&R coun­tries. 3) Ex­pand­ing co­op­er­a­tion in tourism. China has held joint year of tourism with many other B&R coun­tries, ini­ti­at­ing co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms such as the Silk Road Tourism Pro­mo­tion Union, Mar­itime Silk Road Tourism Pro­mo­tion Al­liance, and Tea Road In­ter­na­tional Tourism Al­liance. China has signed mu­tual visa ex­emp­tion agree- ments for dif­fer­ent types of pass­port with 57 B&R coun­tries, and con­cluded 19 agree­ments or ar­range­ments to stream- line visa ap­pli­ca­tion pro­ce­dures with 15 coun­tries. In 2018 out­bound Chi­nese tourists num­bered 150 mil­lion, and in­bound for­eign tourists num­bered 30.54 mil­lion. Rus­sia, Myan­mar, Viet Nam, Mon­go­lia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, and Sin­ga­pore were the main sources of tourists for China. 4) Deeper co­op­er­a­tion in health and medicine. Since the first Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­opera- tion, China has signed 56 agree­ments on co­op­er­a­tion in the health sec­tor with coun­tries such as Mon­go­lia and Afghani- stan, in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions such as the World Health Or­ga­ni­za­tion, and NGOs such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion. In Au­gust 2017 the Belt and Road High-Level Meet­ing for Health Co­op­er­a­tion: To­wards a Health Silk Road was held in Bei­jing, which is­sued the “Bei­jing Com- mu­niqué of the Belt and Road Health Co­op­er­a­tion”. China has car­ried out co­op­er­a­tion on the preven­tion and con­trol of AIDS, malaria, dengue, flu, and tu­ber­cu­lo­sis with Lan­cang- Mekong coun­tries; on the preven­tion and con­trol of echi- no­coc­co­sis, plague and other zoonoses with Cen­tral Asian coun­tries; and on the preven­tion and con­trol of polio with Western Asian coun­tries. China has dis­patched oph­thal­mol- ogy teams to Cam­bo­dia, Myan­mar, Laos, and Sri Lanka to carry out the “Bright­ness Ac­tion” pro­gram, and short- term med­i­cal teams to is­land coun­tries such as Fiji, Tonga, Mi­crone­sia, and Van­u­atu in the Pa­cific. It has es­tab­lished tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine cen­ters in 35 B&R coun­tries, and 43 in­ter­na­tional TCM co­op­er­a­tion bases. 5) On­go­ing ef­fort in dis­as­ter re­lief, as­sis­tance, and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. Since the first Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion, China has pro­vided RMB2 bil­lion in emer­gency food as­sis­tance to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries par­tic­i­pat­ing in the ini­tia­tive, in­jected an ad­di­tional US$1 bil- lion to the South-South Co­op­er­a­tion As­sis­tance Fund, and im­ple­mented 100 Happy Home Projects, 100 Anti-Poverty Projects, and 100 Health Re­cov­ery Projects. China has par­tic- ipated in 8 joint pro­grams for the pro­tec­tion of cul­tural relics with 6 coun­tries, and 15 joint arche­o­log­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties with 12 coun­tries. China has pro­vided Laos and other coun­tries with seis­mic mon­i­tor­ing equip­ment to im­prove their early warn­ing and dis­as­ter al­le­vi­a­tion ca­pac­ity. China has ini­ti­ated 24 co­op­er­a­tion pro­grams with civil so­ci­ety or­ga­ni­za­tions in Cam­bo­dia and Nepal, in an ef­fort to im­prove the lives of lo­cal peo­ple. 6) In­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive draws in­vest­ment from di­verse sources, en­cour­ages third-party mar­ket co­opera- tion, and aims to build in­dus­try, sup­ply, ser­vice, and value chains that ben­e­fit all and are shared by all, so as to pro­vide new growth driv­ers for faster de­vel­op­ment in the par­tici- pat­ing coun­tries. 1) Sta­ble growth in China’s di­rect in­vest­ment in B&R coun­tries. From 2013 to 2018 China’s di­rect in­vest­ment in B&R coun­tries sur­passed US$90 bil­lion, re­al­iz­ing a turnover of US$400 bil­lion in for­eign con­tracted projects in these coun- tries. In 2018 Chi­nese busi­nesses made a to­tal of US$15.6 bil­lion in non-fi­nan­cial di­rect in­vest­ment in B&R coun­tries, grow­ing by 8.9 per­cent year on year and ac­count­ing for 13 per­cent of China’s to­tal non-fi­nan­cial FDI dur­ing the same pe­riod. The turnover of for­eign con­tracted projects in B&R coun­tries reached US$89.3 bil­lion, or 53 per­cent of the to­tal turnover of for­eign con­tracted projects in the same pe­riod. Ac- cord­ing to a World Bank study, the trans­porta­tion net­work pro- posed by the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive can lead to a 4.97-per­cent in­crease in to­tal FDI flows to B&R coun­tries, a 4.36-per­cent in­crease in FDI flows within B&R coun­tries, a 4.63-per­cent in­crease in FDI flows from OECD coun­tries, and a 5.75-per­cent in­crease in FDI flows from non-B&R coun­tries. 2) Steady progress in in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion on in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment and third-party mar­kets. As faster growth in B&R coun­tries has gen­er­ated huge mar­ket de­mands on in­ter­na­tional in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion, China has taken ac­tive mea­sures to boost mar­ket-ori­ented in­dus- trial co­op­er­a­tion with rel­e­vant coun­tries in all ar­eas, so as to up­grade the in­dus­trial struc­ture and raise the level of in­dus­tries in these coun­tries. Cur­rently China has signed agree­ments on in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion with more than 40 coun­tries in­clud­ing Kaza­khstan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Brazil. It has dove­tailed in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion pro­grams with re­gional or­ga­ni­za­tions such as the ASEAN, African Union, and CELAC. China has signed third-party mar­ket co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments with France, Italy, Spain, Ja­pan, and Por­tu­gal. 3) Vig­or­ous de­vel­op­ment in co­op­er­a­tion parks and zones. Ap­ply­ing mar­ket prin­ci­ples and com­ply­ing with laws, Chi­nese busi­nesses of all types have joined in the de­vel­op­ment of co­op­er­a­tion parks and zones in other B&R coun­tries, shar­ing China’s best prac­tices and the ex­pe­ri­ence it has gained in de­vel­op­ment zones and in­dus- trial parks dur­ing re­form and open­ing up. In ad­di­tion to pro­mot­ing the lo­cal econ­omy, these have also cre­ated new sources of tax rev­enue and jobs in the coun­tries in­volved. China has es­tab­lished the China-Kaza­khstan Khor­gos In- ter­na­tional Bor­der Co­op­er­a­tion Cen­ter, and the China-Laos Mo­han-Boten Cross-Bor­der Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Zone; more cross-bor­der eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion zones with other coun­tries are be­ing planned or built. II. Con­tri­bu­tions With a view to build­ing a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive up­holds the prin­ci­ples of ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri­bu­tion, and shared ben­e­fits. Through the ini­tia­tive China has made a con­struc- tive con­tri­bu­tion to the re­form of the cur­rent global gover- nance sys­tem and to eco­nomic glob­al­iza­tion. 1. Ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion: from a Chi­nese pro­posal to a global con­sen­sus Ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion means ad­dress­ing is­sues that mat­ter to all through con­sul­ta­tion. On the ba­sis of equal­ity and free will, this prin­ci­ple em­pha­sizes equal par­tic­i­pa­tion and full con­sul­ta­tion in the process, so as to reach con­sen- sus in un­der­stand­ing, achieve con­ver­gence for co­op­er­a­tion, and de­velop a fo­cus for com­mon de­vel­op­ment. - Build­ing in­ter­na­tional plat­forms for ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion. In May 2017, the first Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion held in Bei­jing was a great suc­cess. The event was at­tended by heads of state and gov- ern­ment of 29 coun­tries as well as more than 1,600 repre- sen­ta­tives from over 140 coun­tries and 80-plus in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions. The fo­rum pro­duced 279 de­liv­er­ables, in- volv­ing 76 ma­jor items in five key ar­eas. All these achieve- ments have now been im­ple­mented. The sec­ond Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion will be held in Bei­jing in April 2019. The fo­rum has be­come an im­por­tant plat­form for par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or- ga­ni­za­tions, en­abling more co­op­er­a­tion, closer ties, more exchanges, and en­hanced mu­tual trust. In Novem­ber 2018, the first China In­ter­na­tional Im­port Expo was held, at­tract­ing 172 coun­tries, re­gions and in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions and more than 3,600 en­ter­prises from out­side China. At the first Hongqiao In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomic Fo­rum held at the expo, over 4,500 par­tic­i­pants from gov­ern­ments, busi­nesses, and aca­demic and re­search in­sti­tu­tions en­gaged in di­a­logue and exchanges and voiced their opin­ions. China has also hosted many large-scale ex­po­si­tions such as the Silk Road In­terna- tional Ex­po­si­tion and the In­vest­ment and Trade Fo­rum for Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween East and West China, the China-ASEAN Expo, the China-Eura­sia Expo, the China-Arab States Expo, the China-South Asia Expo, the China-North­east Asia Expo, and the Western China In­ter­na­tional Fair. These events have be­come im­por­tant plat­forms for con­sul­ta­tion and co­opera- tion be­tween China and other B&R coun­tries. - Strength­en­ing the role of mul­ti­lat­eral mech­a­nisms in ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion. The con­certed ef­forts to build the Belt and Road re­flect the trends of the times – peace and de­vel­op­ment. Up­hold­ing the prin­ci­ples of con­sul­ta­tion on an equal foot­ing, open­ness, and in­clu­sive­ness, they aim to pro­mote mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion among B&R coun­tries on the ba­sis of ex­ist­ing in­ter­na­tional mech­a­nisms. Ap­ply­ing the prin­ci­ples of mu­tual re­spect and mu­tual trust, China ac­tively en­gages in sub­stan­tive co­or­di­na­tion and co­op­er­a­tion on the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive with other par- tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, fully uti­liz­ing ex­ist­ing mul­ti­lat­eral co- oper­a­tion mech­a­nisms such as: . G20, . APEC, . Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­ga­ni­za­tion, . Asia-Europe Meet­ing, . Asia Co­op­er­a­tion Di­a­logue, . Con­fer­ence on In­ter­ac­tion and Con­fi­dence-Build­ing Mea­sures in Asia, . China-ASEAN (10+1) co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nism, . Lan­cang-Mekong co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nism, . Greater Mekong Subre­gion Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion, . Greater Tu­men Ini­tia­tive, . Cen­tral Asia Re­gional Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion, . Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion, . China-Arab States Co­op­er­a­tion Fo­rum, . China-CELAC Fo­rum, . China-CEEC “16+1 co­op­er­a­tion” mech­a­nism, . China-Pa­cific Is­land Coun­tries Eco­nomic De­velop- ment and Co­op­er­a­tion Fo­rum, . World Eco­nomic Fo­rum, . Boao Fo­rum for Asia. – Es­tab­lish­ing a track two mech­a­nism for di­a­logue. Through track two chan­nels such as po­lit­i­cal par­ties, par­lia- ments, think tanks, lo­cal au­thor­i­ties, NGOs, busi­ness commu- ni­ties, the me­dia, and in­sti­tu­tions of higher learn­ing, China and other B&R coun­tries can en­gage in di­verse com­mu­nica- tion, di­a­logue, ex­change, and co­op­er­a­tion, fo­cus­ing on joint ef­forts to build the Belt and Road. China has or­ga­nized the CPC in Di­a­logue with World Po­lit­i­cal Par­ties High-Level Meet­ing, dur­ing which the CPC had ex­ten­sive com­mu­ni­ca­tion with po­lit­i­cal par­ties from other coun­tries on is­sues of the Belt and Road. China and other rel­e­vant coun­tries have joint- ly es­tab­lished the Silk Road Think Tank As­so­ci­a­tion, Silk Road Think Tank Net­work, and Uni­ver­sity Al­liance of the Silk Road. The UK, Ja­pan, Ko­rea, Sin­ga­pore, Kaza­khstan and other coun­tries have es­tab­lished re­search in­sti­tu­tions on the Belt and Road and held a va­ri­ety of fo­rums and sympo- siums. Uni­ver­si­ties in China and other coun­tries have jointly es­tab­lished re­search cen­ters on the Belt and Road, schools for Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment, and train- ing cen­ters, with the aim of cul­ti­vat­ing in­ter­na­tional tal­ent to build the Belt and Road. Through means such as hold­ing me­dia fo­rums, co-pro­duc­ing doc­u­men­taries, and ar­rang­ing joint in­ter­views, Chi­nese and for­eign me­dia have strength- ened co­op­er­a­tion and ex­change, improved their in­ter­na­tional com­mu­ni­ca­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and helped the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to ac­cess timely in­for­ma­tion on joint ef­forts to build the Belt and Road. 2. Joint con­tri­bu­tion: join­ing forces to build a har- mo­nious in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity Joint con­tri­bu­tion means that all the par­ties are equal par­tic­i­pants, builders and con­trib­u­tors, and share re­sponsi- bil­i­ties and risks. – Build­ing fi­nanc­ing plat­forms for co­op­er­a­tion. Since open­ing in 2016, the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest- ment Bank (AIIB), which was es­tab­lished in ac­cor­dance with a pro­posal from China, has played a role of in­creas­ing im­por­tance in the in­ter­na­tional mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment sys­tem. It has won broad trust and recog­ni­tion from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. As of the end of 2018, the mem- bership of AIIB had grown from the 57 found­ing mem­bers to 93, spread across five con­ti­nents. It had ap­proved loans of US$7.5 bil­lion and lever­aged other in­vest­ments to­tal­ing al­most US$40 bil­lion. Its 35 ap­proved projects are dis­trib- uted over 13 coun­tries in­clud­ing In­done­sia, Pak­istan, Ta- jik­istan, Azer­bai­jan, Oman, Turkey and Egypt. In ful­fill­ing its own pur­poses and mis­sions, the bank has be­come one of the key mul­ti­lat­eral plat­forms for build­ing the Belt and Road, along with other mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment banks. In Novem­ber 2014 the Chi­nese govern­ment pledged US$40 bil­lion to es­tab­lish a Silk Road Fund, and in May 2017, it an­nounced an ad­di­tional RMB100 bil­lion con­tri­bu­tion to the fund. As of the end of 2018, the con­tracted in­vest­ment un­der the fund had reached about US$11 bil­lion, with ac- tual in­vest­ment adding up to US$7.7 bil­lion; the fund had also al­lo­cated US$2 bil­lion to set up the China-Kaza­khstan In­dus­trial Ca­pac­ity Co­op­er­a­tion Fund. In 2017, the Chi- nese govern­ment es­tab­lished the Pub­lic-Pri­vate-Part­ner­ship mech­a­nism for the Belt and Road, and signed an MoU with the United Na­tions Eco­nomic Com­mis­sion for Europe, to jointly pro­mote bet­ter ap­pli­ca­tion of the mech­a­nism in Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion projects - Ac­tively con­duct­ing co­op­er­a­tion in third-party mar­kets. In our ef­forts to build the Belt and Road, we are com­mit­ted to pro­mot­ing open, in­clu­sive, prag­matic and ef­fec­tive co­op­er­a­tion in third­party mar­kets, so as to help Chi­nese and for­eign en­ter­prises utilize their com­ple­men- tary strengths and achieve a “1+1+1>3” all-win re­sult in which the ben­e­fits of three-party co­op­er­a­tion are greater than what the par­ties can pro­duce sep­a­rately. In 2018 two suc­cess­ful fo­rums were held: the first Fo­rum on Chi­naJa­pan Third-Party Mar­ket Co­op­er­a­tion and the sec­ond meet­ing of the Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for China-France Third-Party Co­op­er­a­tion. A batch of co­op­er­a­tion projects such as the Hink­ley Point C nu­clear power sta­tion in the UK were put into ef­fect. China’s CRRC and Ger­many’s Siemens reached con­sen­sus on third-party co­op­er­a­tion in some key projects. 3. Shared ben­e­fits: en­sur­ing all par­ties gain real ben­e­fits Shared ben­e­fits mean that we take into con­sid­er­a­tion the in­ter­ests and con­cerns of part­ners of co­op­er­a­tion, seek a con­ver­gence of in­ter­ests with other coun­tries, and ex­pand com­mon ground, so as to en­sure that our co­op­er­a­tion is not only mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial but is ben­e­fi­cial to all par­ties. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive is not a zero-sum game which re­sults in the win of one party and the loss of the other. Rather, it is meant for mu­tual ben­e­fits and win-win and all-win out­comes. – Bring­ing China’s de­vel­op­ment achieve­ments to other B&R coun­tries. For sev­eral years now, China has ac­counted for about 30 per­cent of world eco­nomic growth. Through the rapid ex­pan­sion of its de­mand for im­ports, China pro­pels eco­nomic growth in the B&R coun­tries that ex­port goods to China. At the same time, China is mak­ing a grow­ing con­tri­bu­tion to in­ter­na­tional trade. China’s im­ports in goods and ser­vices both ac­count for one tenth of the to­tal global value. In 2018, China im­ported goods worth RMB14.1 tril­lion, up 12.9 per­cent from 2017. Its FDI to- taled US$129.83 bil­lion, 4.2 per­cent higher than 2017, and the per­cent­age of di­rect in­vest­ment to other B&R coun­tries grew year by year. Un­der the co­op­er­a­tion frame­work of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, China sup­ports de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as those in Asia, Africa and Latin Amer­ica to in­vest more in in­fra­struc­ture. As a re­sult, the ben­e­fits of world eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment are con­tin­u­ously brought to those coun­tries. Ac­cord­ing to the quan­ti­ta­tive trade model of a World Bank study, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will in- crease the GDP of East Asian and Pa­cific de­vel­op­ing coun- tries by 2.6-3.9 per­cent on av­er­age.3 - Im­prov­ing peo­ple’s well­be­ing in other B&R coun­tries. China in­cludes the pro­vi­sion of aid in poverty re­duc­tion, agri­cul­ture, ed­u­ca­tion, health, en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and other ar­eas into the joint ef­forts to build the Belt and Road. China has im­ple­mented the Pro­gram for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion on Poverty Re­duc­tion and Pub- lic Wel­fare, and pi­lot projects of the East Asia Co­opera- tion Ini­tia­tive on Poverty Re­duc­tion. It is ac­tively help­ing coun­tries in the basin of the Mekong River to tackle se­vere droughts by re­leas­ing emer­gency wa­ter sup­plies. It is also pro­vid­ing tech­no­log­i­cal aid in flood con­trol to Thai­land and Myan­mar. China signed an MoU with the WHO on health co­op­er­a­tion as part of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. It has also im­ple­mented a pro­gram for China-Africa pub­lic health co­op­er­a­tion and the China-ASEAN train­ing pro­grams for 100 pub­lic health pro­fes­sion­als. China has trained sev- eral thou­sand pro­fes­sion­als in pub­lic health man­age­ment and disease preven­tion and con­trol in co­op­er­a­tion with other B&R coun­tries, and has of­fered free sight re­ha­bilita- tion surgery to more than 5,200 cataract pa­tients in those coun­tries. Ev­ery year, China pro­vides qual­ity med­i­cal ser­vices to ap­prox­i­mately 30,000 pa­tients in neigh­bor­ing coun­tries. Chi­nese TCM teams have im­ple­mented plans for the rapid erad­i­ca­tion of malaria in coun­tries in­clud­ing Cam­bo­dia, Co­moros, Togo, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Pa­pua New Guinea. - Fa­cil­i­tat­ing the trans­fer of sci­en­tific and tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tions to other B&R coun­tries. China has signed 46 agree­ments on co­op­er­a­tion in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy with other B&R coun­tries, and launched China-ASEAN and China-South Asia sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy part­ner­ship pro- grams. It has built five re­gional plat­forms for tech­no­log­i­cal trans­fer with ASEAN, South Asia, Arab States, Cen­tral Asia, and Cen­tral and Eastern Europe, and pro­posed and co- es­tab­lished the Al­liance of In­ter­na­tional Sci­ence Or­ga­ni­za­tions in the Belt and Road Re­gion. A multi-level and di­verse ex­change mech­a­nism in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy and hu- man­i­ties has been formed through var­i­ous means, such as short terms of re­search in China by young sci­en­tists and the train­ing of sci­ence and man­age­ment per­son­nel from other B&R coun­tries. In 2018, China hosted 500 young sci­en­tists from such coun­tries to carry out re­search, and trained more than 1,200 sci­ence and man­age­ment pro­fes­sion­als. China ac­tively con­ducts co­op­er­a­tion with other B&R coun­tries in space tech­nol­ogy and makes its BeiDou Nav­i­ga­tion Sa­tel- lite Sys­tem, satel­lite com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tems and satel­lite me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal re­mote sens­ing tech­nolo­gies avail­able to them. - Pro­mot­ing green de­vel­op­ment. Up­hold­ing the Paris Agree­ment, China ac­tively ad­vo­cates and en­cour­ages the in­te­gra­tion of green de­vel­op­ment into the joint ef­forts to build the Belt and Road. China has signed an MoU on build­ing green Belt and Road with the United Na­tions En- vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme, and agree­ments on co­op­er­a­tion in eco­log­i­cal con­ser­va­tion with over 30 coun­tries along the routes. Since build­ing green Belt and Road has be­come an im­por­tant means to im­ple­ment the United Na­tions 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment, more than 100 part­ners from the rel­e­vant coun­tries and re­gions have estab- lished the In­ter­na­tional Coali­tion for Green De­vel­op­ment on the Belt and Road. In 2016, un­der China’s pres­i­dency of the G20, green fi­nance be­came a key agenda item for the first time. A Green Fi­nance Study Group was set up, which re­leased the “G20 Green Fi­nance Syn­the­sis Re­port”. China has ac­tively im­ple­mented the Green Silk Road En­voys Pro­gram, and has trained 2,000 peo­ple from other B&R coun­tries. It has is­sued doc­u­ments such as “Guid­ance on Pro­mot­ing Green Belt and Road” and the “Belt and Road Eco­log­i­cal and En­vi­ron­men­tal Co­op­er­a­tion Plan”, with the aim of ful­fill­ing its re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and stan­dards in build- ing green Belt and Road. 4. Vi­sion: build­ing a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture The joint ef­forts to build the Belt and Road re­flect hu- man­ity’s com­mon as­pi­ra­tion for a bright fu­ture. More and more mem­bers of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity have iden­ti­fied with the idea of build­ing a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture ad­vo­cated by the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. The idea is in har­mony with the need for world eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and the di­rec­tion of the progress of world civ­i­liza­tion. The ini­tia­tive is be­com­ing an im­por­tant plat­form for build­ing a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture. - Pro­posed by China but be­long­ing to the whole world. The Belt and Road cov­ers dif­fer­ent re­gions at dif- fer­ent stages of de­vel­op­ment that have dif­fer­ent cul­tures. It is an open and in­clu­sive plat­form and a global pub­lic prod- uct forged by all par­ties in­volved. Di­rected to­ward a shared fu­ture for hu­man­ity, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive up­holds its non­com­pet­i­tive and nonex­clu­sive na­ture to the fullest ex- tent. It re­flects the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s de­mand for a global gov­er­nance sys­tem that is fair, egal­i­tar­ian, open and in­clu­sive. It is an im­por­tant pub­lic prod­uct ori­ented to­ward to­day’s world. As UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­tónio Guter­res has pointed out, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and the United Na­tion’s Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals share the same grand goals, and both are pub­lic goods of­fered to the world. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive not only pro­motes in­ter­na­tion- al trade and peo­ple-to-peo­ple exchanges, but also en­hances un­der­stand­ing be­tween coun­tries and re­duces cul­tural bar- ri­ers, to ul­ti­mately achieve peace, har­mony and pros­per­ity. - Of­fer­ing a Chi­nese ap­proach to re­form­ing the cur­rent global gov­er­nance sys­tem. Our world to­day faces chal­lenges such as an in­suf­fi­cient drive for growth, an out­dated gov­er­nance struc­ture, and im­bal­anced de­vel­op­ment. Be­ing open and in­clu­sive and aim­ing for com­mon de­velop- ment, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive tran­scends dif­fer­ences in so­cial sys­tems and cul­tures, re­spects the di­ver­sity of world civ­i­liza­tion and the co­ex­is­tence of di­verse cul­tures, and em­pha­sizes mu­tual com­ple­men­tar­ity and mu­tual ben­e­fit among coun­tries at dif­fer­ent lev­els of eco­nomic de­velop- ment. It fo­cuses on im­prov­ing con­di­tions and cre­at­ing op- por­tu­ni­ties for de­vel­op­ment, strength­en­ing the drive for de­vel­op­ment, and shar­ing the fruits of de­vel­op­ment. It pro­pels the in­ter­ac­tion be­tween global gov­er­nance, secu- rity, and de­vel­op­ment – an at­tempt to pro­vide an al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tion to these is­sues as they have not been ad­dressed ef- fec­tively in iso­la­tion over long pe­ri­ods of time. - Bind­ing to­gether B&R coun­tries to share a com­mon fu­ture. We have only one earth, and all coun­tries share the same planet. To meet the var­i­ous chal­lenges faced by hu­man­ity and work for a bright fu­ture in which the whole world en­joys peace, pros­per­ity and de­vel­op­ment, coun­tries across the globe should share the rough times and the smooth and build an open, in­clu­sive, clean, and beau­ti­ful world that en­joys last­ing peace, com­mon se­cu­rity, and shared pros­per- ity. The con­cept of a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture in­volves com­bin­ing in­ter­ests, seek­ing com­mon feel­ings, val­ues, and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and shar­ing the ben­e­fits of de- vel­op­ment. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive calls for mu­tual sup­port and as­sis­tance and is in­formed by equal­ity, cul­tural affin­ity, and em­pa­thy. It up­holds the prin­ci­ples of seek­ing com­mon ground while re­serv­ing dif­fer­ences, in­clu­sive- ness, mu­tual un­der­stand­ing, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and di­a­logue, and in­ter­ac­tions on an equal foot­ing. We should re­gard the de­vel­op­ment of other coun­tries as our own op­por­tu­nity and pro­mote the con­ver­gence of China’s de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties with those of its B&R part­ners and other coun­tries in the wider world, so as to en­sure that our de­vel­op­ment ben­e­fits both sides of co­op­er­a­tion and all rel­e­vant par­ties. Dur­ing its four decades of re­form and open­ing up, China has ac­cu­mu­lated a wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence that can be used by other coun­tries. It has no de­sire to ex­port its ide­ol­ogy and no in­ten­tion to im­pose its de­vel­op­ment model on other coun­tries. It is will­ing to share its ex­pe­ri­ence with other coun­tries and cre­ate a bright fu­ture to­gether with its B&R part­ners un­der the B&R frame­work. III. Prospects To­day’s world is in a stage of ma­jor de­vel­op­ments, trans­for­ma­tion and ad­just­ment. Peace, de­vel­op­ment and co­op­er­a­tion re­main the themes of the times. Look­ing into the fu­ture, in pur­su­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, China will face many prob­lems and chal­lenges, as well as un­prec- edented op­por­tu­ni­ties and prospects for de­vel­op­ment. This is an ini­tia­tive that in­volves many par­ties and re­quires con- certed ef­forts. This is an ini­tia­tive that de­cides the fu­ture and re­quires un­remit­ting ef­forts. This is an ini­tia­tive that ben­e­fits hu­man­ity and re­quires care­ful nur­ture. We be­lieve that with the pass­ing of time and the syn­ergy of all par­ties, Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion will def­i­nitely be­come deep and con­crete, steady and ex­ten­sive. The Belt and Road will be­come a road of peace, pros­per­ity, open­ing up, green de- vel­op­ment, in­no­va­tion, con­nected civ­i­liza­tions, and clean govern­ment. It will make eco­nomic glob­al­iza­tion be­come more open, in­clu­sive, bal­anced and ben­e­fi­cial to all. 1. A road of peace The an­cient Silk Road thrived in times of peace and de­clined in times of war. With­out a peace­ful and sta­ble en- vi­ron­ment, it would be im­pos­si­ble to pur­sue the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive aims to build a new model of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions fea­tur­ing mu­tual re- spect, fair­ness, jus­tice and win-win co­op­er­a­tion, and forge part­ner­ships through di­a­logue rather than con­fronta­tion and friend­ship rather than al­liance. All coun­tries should re­spect each other’s sovereignty, dig­nity, ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity, de­vel- op­ment path, so­cial sys­tems, and core in­ter­ests, and ac­com- mo­date each other’s ma­jor con­cerns. Peace and se­cu­rity are the pre­req­ui­site and guar­an­tee for build­ing the Belt and Road. All coun­tries should fos- ter a vi­sion of com­mon, com­pre­hen­sive, co­op­er­a­tive and sus­tain­able se­cu­rity, and en­sure that a se­cu­rity en­v­i­ron- ment is built by all and for all. All coun­tries should re­solve con­flicts through po­lit­i­cal means, and pro­mote me­di­a­tion in the spirit of jus­tice and fair­ness. We should in­ten­sify coun­tert­er­ror­ism ef­forts by ad­dress­ing both the symp­toms and root causes, and by elim­i­nat­ing poverty, back­ward­ness and so­cial in­jus­tice. All coun­tries should res­o­lutely re­ject the Cold War men­tal­ity, zero-sum game and power pol­i­tics, and op­pose ter­ror­ism, sep­a­ratism and ex­trem­ism. All coun­tries should of­fer mu­tual sup­port on ma­jor is­sues con- cern­ing core in­ter­ests such as na­tional sovereignty, ter­rito- rial in­tegrity, na­tional se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity. All coun­tries should set­tle dis­putes through di­a­logue, re­solve dif­fer­ences through dis­cus­sion, en­hance co­op­er­a­tion and mu­tual trust, and re­duce mu­tual mis­giv­ings. All coun­tries need to foster in-depth co­op­er­a­tion in en­sur­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity, fight­ing transna­tional crimes and drug traf­fick­ing, com­bat­ing ter- ror­ism, sep­a­ratism and ex­trem­ism, and en­hanc­ing joint law en­force­ment and pub­lic se­cu­rity. These mea­sures will help cre­ate a fa­vor­able en­vi­ron­ment for pro­mot­ing re­gional eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and im­prov­ing the well­be­ing of the peo­ple. China is a staunch force in safe­guard­ing re­gional and world peace and pro­mot­ing com­mon de­vel­op­ment. China is com­mit­ted to peace­ful de­vel­op­ment and an in­de­pen­dent for­eign pol­icy of peace. We re­spect the de­vel­op­ment paths and do­mes­tic and for­eign poli­cies pur­sued in­de­pen­dently by the peo­ple of ev­ery coun­try. China will never in­ter­fere in the in­ter­nal af­fairs of any coun­try, never im­pose its own will on any coun­try, and never place its own in­ter­ests above the in­ter­ests of any coun­try. To en­sure the smooth im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, China will work to­gether with all other coun­tries in­volved to estab- lish a dis­pute set­tle­ment mech­a­nism, a se­cu­rity risk ear­ly­warn­ing and mon­i­tor­ing mech­a­nism, and an emer­gency re­sponse mech­a­nism. In any case of dis­pute, all par­ties in­volved can dis­cuss their in­ter­ests and con­cerns through di­a­logue rather than en­gage in con­fronta­tion. Such di­a­logue will foster a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment en­vi­ron­ment for Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion, and help all par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to build a har­mo­nious world where they re­spect each other’s core in­ter­ests and set­tle dis­putes by peace­ful means. 2. A road of pros­per­ity De­vel­op­ment holds the mas­ter key to solv­ing all prob- lems. In pur­su­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, we should fo­cus on the fun­da­men­tal is­sue of de­vel­op­ment, re­lease the growth po­ten­tial of par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, and achieve eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and co­or­di­nated de­vel­op­ment to the ben­e­fit of all par­tic­i­pants. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive com­plies with the trend to­ward mul­ti­po­lar­ity, eco­nomic glob­al­iza­tion, cul­tural di­ver­sity, and IT ap­pli­ca­tion, and up­holds the global free trade sys­tem and an open world econ­omy. B&R coun­tries have com­ple­men­tary strengths in mar- ket size and re­sources, show­ing great po­ten­tial and broad prospects for co­op­er­a­tion. Fully at­tend­ing to all par­ties’ in- ter­ests and con­cerns, B&R coun­tries should build con­sen- sus and trans­form con­sen­sus into ac­tions. By strength­en­ing the con­nec­tiv­ity of our de­vel­op­ment strate­gies, plans, plat- forms and projects, we will achieve more tan­gi­ble re­sults and lever­age our com­par­a­tive strengths in the in­ter­est of our com­mon pros­per­ity and de­vel­op­ment. Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion will con­tinue to pri­or­i­tize con­nec­tiv­ity, fo­cus­ing on key pas­sage­ways, points, and projects. China will ad­vance co­op­er­a­tion with other par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries in the fields of roads, rail­ways, ports, avi­a­tion, aero­space, oil and gas pipe­lines, power sup­ply, and net­work com­mu­ni­ca­tions, to achieve land, mar­itime, air and cy­berspace con­nec­tiv­ity. China will build a Belt and Road space in­for­ma­tion cor­ri­dor to­gether with other B&R coun­tries. China will en­hance mu­tual ben­e­fits in eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion, and ex­pand bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral in­vest­ment and trade. China will pro­mote deeper in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion and work for the suc­cess of eco­nomic, trade and in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion zones. We will seize the op­por- tu­ni­ties cre­ated by the new in­dus­trial revo­lu­tion to cul­ti­vate new driv­ing forces and new busi­ness mod­els to main­tain the vi­tal­ity of the econ­omy. Dur­ing the sec­ond Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion, China will sign a num­ber of key projects on in­dus­trial and in­vest­ment co- oper­a­tion with other B&R coun­tries. China will es­tab­lish a sta­ble and sus­tain­able fi­nan­cial ser­vice sys­tem that keeps risks un­der con­trol, and cre­ate new mod­els of in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing. China will also en­cour­age closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween govern­ment and pri­vate cap­i­tal, build a di­verse fi­nanc­ing sys­tem and a multi-tiered cap­i­tal mar­ket, de­velop in­clu­sive fi­nance, and im­prove fi­nan­cial ser­vice net­works. 3. A road of open­ing up Open­ing up brings progress while iso­la­tion re­sults in back­ward­ness. For a coun­try to open it­self to the out­side world, it is like a silk moth break­ing free from its co­coon. There will be short-term pains, but one gets a new life af- ter­wards. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive calls for open­ing up, which in turn will en­able us to achieve both eco­nomic growth and bal­anced de­vel­op­ment. In purs­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, we should seek in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment that is ben­e­fi­cial to all, build an open plat­form of co­op­er­a­tion, and foster an open world econ­omy. The Belt and Road is an ini­tia­tive for peace­ful de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion, rather than a geo- po­lit­i­cal or mil­i­tary al­liance; it is a process of open, in­clu­sive and com­mon de­vel­op­ment, rather than an ex­clu­sion­ary bloc or a “China club”. It nei­ther dif­fer­en­ti­ates coun­tries by ide­ol­ogy, nor plays the zero-sum game. Re­gard­less of its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem, ge­o­graph­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment, de­vel­op­ment stage, and cul­tural back­ground, any coun­try is wel­come to join the cir­cle of friends in the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, fol- low­ing the prin­ci­ples of ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri- bu­tion and shared ben­e­fits to achieve win-win co­op­er­a­tion. China up­holds and strength­ens the mul­ti­lat­eral trade sys­tem which is rule-based, open, trans­par­ent, in­clu­sive and non-dis­crim­i­na­tive. China pro­motes lib­er­al­iza­tion and fa­cil­i­ta­tion of trade and in­vest­ment by build­ing high- stan­dard free trade ar­eas jointly with other B&R coun­tries, to ad­vance the sound de­vel­op­ment of eco­nomic glob­al­iza­tion. In ad­di­tion, Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion also ad­dresses is­sues such as im­bal­ances in de­vel­op­ment, dif­fi­cul­ties in gov­er­nance, the dig­i­tal di­vide, and in­come dis­par­ity, to pro­vide equal de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties to all coun­tries in the world and share the fruits of de­vel­op­ment with all peo­ples. Through the Belt and Road, China will keep open­ing its door wider. China is will­ing to bring new op­por­tu­ni­ties for com­mon de­vel­op­ment to all coun­tries, help other coun- tries de­velop an open econ­omy suited to their own ac­tual con­di­tions, and join our ef­forts in build­ing a global com- mu­nity of shared fu­ture. 4. A road of green de­vel­op­ment The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive pur­sues the vi­sion of green de­vel­op­ment and a way of life and work that is green, low-car­bon, cir­cu­lar and sus­tain­able. The ini­tia­tive is com­mit­ted to strength­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion on en­vi­ron­men- tal pro­tec­tion and de­fus­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal risks. It aims to build con­sen­sus on green de­vel­op­ment and in­crease mu­tual un­der­stand­ing and mu­tual sup­port be­tween gov­ern­ments, be­tween en­ter­prises and be­tween peo­ples of the Belt and Road coun­tries, to ful­fill the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. B&R coun­tries should pur­sue eco-friendly de­velop- ment, in­te­grate eco­log­i­cal con­ser­va­tion and green de­vel- op­ment into eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion, and form a green de­vel­op­ment model in which en­vi­ron­men­tal protec- tion and eco­nomic and trade co­op­er­a­tion com­ple­ment each other. We should ex­plore a path of sound de­vel­op­ment that en­sures growth, bet­ter lives, and a good en­vi­ron­ment. We should carry out co­op­er­a­tion in en­ergy con­ser­va­tion and emis­sions re­duc­tion, and jointly re­spond to cli­mate change. We should for­mu­late and put in place sup­port­ing poli­cies for en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion co­op­er­a­tion, and en­hance ef­forts to pro­tect and re­store our ecosys­tems. We should ex­plore and de­velop green fi­nance, in­cor­po­rat­ing envi- ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and eco­log­i­cal con­ser­va­tion into our mod­ern fi­nan­cial sys­tem. China is will­ing to co­op­er­ate on en­vi­ron­men­tal protec- tion with other B&R coun­tries. China will sign co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments with more coun­tries on build­ing green Belt and Road, ex­pand the In­ter­na­tional Coali­tion for Green De­vel­op­ment on the Belt and Road, and es­tab­lish a Co- ali­tion of Sus­tain­able Cities on the Belt and Road. China will build a group of in­ter­na­tional green in­dus­trial coop- er­a­tion plat­forms, in­clud­ing model bases for green in­dus- trial co­op­er­a­tion, bases for green tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and exchanges, tech­nol­ogy de­mon­stra­tion and pop­u­lar­iza­tion bases, and sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy parks. China will build a plat­form of green sup­ply chains for the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. China will also pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion and ex- changes with other B&R coun­tries on the con­struc­tion of na­tional parks, to pro­tect our shared home­land. 5. A road of in­no­va­tion In­no­va­tion is an im­por­tant force pow­er­ing de­velop- ment. In pur­su­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, we need to en­cour­age in­no­va­tion. Over the past five years or so, China and other B&R coun­tries have been im­prov­ing the envi- ron­ment for in­no­va­tion, pool­ing re­sources for in­no­va­tion, and strength­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tion. We will con­tinue to spur the full in­te­gra­tion of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy with in­dus­tries and fi­nance. Since the turn of the cen­tury, global tech­nol­ogy in- no­va­tion has in­ten­si­fied and be­come more ac­tive. Another round of the tech­nol­ogy revo­lu­tion and in­dus­trial re­form is re­struc­tur­ing the global in­no­va­tion land­scape and re­shap- ing the global econ­omy. Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion has pro­vided new op­por­tu­ni­ties for coun­tries in the pri­mary and mid­dle stages of in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion to merge prop­erly into global in­dus­trial chains and value chains. As var­i­ous fac­tors and re­sources for de­vel­op­ment are shared, flow­ing and re­group­ing among B&R coun­tries, each coun­try can lever­age their com­par­a­tive strengths, fo­cus­ing on stud­ies in cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy ap­pli­ca­tion and on the re­search, de­vel­op­ment and ap­pli­ca­tion of high-tech prod­ucts, to push for­ward in­no­va­tion-driven de­vel­op­ment. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will be­come a new plat­form for the in­no­va­tion-driven de­vel­op­ment of par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, a driv- ing force for their leapfrog de­vel­op­ment, and a new en­gine pro­pel­ling global eco­nomic growth. Through co­or­di­nated de­vel­op­ment and joint re­sponse to chal­lenges, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive has en­abled dif­fer­ent coun­tries and dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple to share the fruits of eco­nomic glob­al­iza- tion dur­ing the de­vel­op­ment of an open world econ­omy, and the mo­men­tum will con­tinue. The dig­i­tal econ­omy is a ma­jor eco­nomic trans­forma- tion, a suc­ces­sor to the agri­cul­tural econ­omy and the in- dus­trial econ­omy. The world is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a revo­lu­tion in tech­nol­ogy and in­dus­trial re­form on a larger scale and at a deeper level. As mod­ern in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy makes con­tin­u­ous break­throughs and the dig­i­tal econ­omy thrives, all coun­tries have seen their in­ter­ests more closely con- nected. All par­ties in­volved in the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive should pur­sue in­no­va­tion-driven de­vel­op­ment, in­ten­sify co­op­er­a­tion in fron­tier ar­eas such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, nan­otech­nol­ogy and quan­tum com­put­ing, and pro­mote big data, cloud com­put­ing and smart cities, so as to turn them into a dig­i­tal Silk Road of the 21st cen­tury. China has formed a multi-level and di­verse mech­a­nism for tech­nolog- ical and peo­ple-to-peo­ple exchanges, by of­fer­ing short-term re­search vis­its to China for young sci­en­tists and of­fer­ing train­ing pro­grams for sci­ence and man­age­ment per­son­nel from other B&R coun­tries. Through build­ing na­tional level plat­forms for joint sci­en­tific re­search, China has en­hanced sta­ble and longterm co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms for tech­nolo- gy in­no­va­tion, to im­prove the ca­pac­ity for tech­nol­ogy inno- va­tion of B&R coun­tries. We need to build a Belt and Road co­or­di­na­tion net­work for tech­nol­ogy trans­fer, to fa­cil­i­tate in­te­grated in­no­va­tion at re­gional level. In­tel­lec­tual prop­erty is es­sen­tial to in­no­va­tion-driven de­vel­op­ment. B&R coun- tries should re­spect in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights, ef­fec­tively pro­tect and utilize in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, and build a sophis- ticated in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion sys­tem. 6. A road of con­nected civ­i­liza­tions In pur­su­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, we should en­sure that with re­gard to dif­fer­ent civ­i­liza­tions, ex­change will re­place es­trange­ment, mu­tual learn­ing will re­place clashes, and co­ex­is­tence will re­place a sense of su­pe­ri­or­ity. This will boost mu­tual un­der­stand­ing, mu­tual re­spect and mu­tual trust be­tween dif­fer­ent coun­tries. The an­cient Silk Road fa­cil­i­tated in­ter­ac­tions be­tween coun­tries and be­tween ethnic groups as well as ad­vances in hu­man civ­i­liza­tion. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive is rooted in pro­found civ­i­liza­tions and in­clu­sive cul­tures. It pro­vides a plat­form for par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to ap­proach each other and en­hance mu­tual learn­ing. It en­ables deeper exchanges be­tween peo­ples from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, cul­tures and his­tor­i­cal back­grounds. It al­lows peo­ples, re­gard­less of their eth­nic­i­ties, cul­tures, so­cial sys­tems and re­li­gions, to com­mu­ni­cate, blend and con­nect with each other from a new height, in joint ef­forts to build a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive en­cour­ages the coun- tries in­volved to conduct ex­ten­sive co­op­er­a­tion in ed­u­ca­tion, tech­nol­ogy, cul­ture, health, sports, me­dia and tourism. It fa­cil­i­tates exchanges among po­lit­i­cal par­ties, youth or­gani- za­tions, civil so­ci­ety or­ga­ni­za­tions, think tanks, women’s as- so­ci­a­tions, and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties. A de­vel­op­ment trend to­ward com­mon pros­per­ity of all civ­i­liza­tions is ap­par­ent, high­light- ing har­mony with­out uni­for­mity and unity in di­ver­sity. China, to­gether with other B&R coun­tries and re- lated in­ter­na­tional or­ga­ni­za­tions, is will­ing to es­tab­lish a multi-tiered mech­a­nism for cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple exchanges, and build more co­op­er­a­tion plat­forms and chan- nels. We should boost ed­u­ca­tional co­op­er­a­tion, in­crease the num­ber of ex­change stu­dents, and im­prove the per­for­mance of co­op­er­a­tively run schools. We should de­velop the Belt and Road Stud­ies Net­work and the Belt and Road News Al­liance. We should co­op­er­ate more in pro­tect­ing his­tori- cal and cul­tural her­itage, pro­vid­ing for­eign aid in cul­tural relics pro­tec­tion, and pro­mot­ing joint ar­chae­o­log­i­cal ac­tivi- ties and exchanges be­tween mu­se­ums. We should jointly de­velop tourist prod­ucts with dis­tinc­tive Silk Road fea­tures. We should en­hance exchanges be­tween po­lit­i­cal par­ties, NGOs, women and youth to pro­mote in­clu­sive de­velop- ment. Dur­ing the sec­ond Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter- na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion, China will launch a co­op­er­a­tion ini­tia­tive on “Ac­cel­er­at­ing the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals for Chil­dren through Shared De­vel­op­ment” in B&R coun­tries with the United Na­tions In­ter­na­tional Chil­dren’s Emer­gency Fund (UNICEF). Civil so­ci­ety or­ga­ni­za­tions in China will start the “Silk Road Com­mu­nity Build­ing” pro­gram to pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion be­tween civil so­ci­ety or- ga­ni­za­tions in all B&R coun­tries to im­prove peo­ple’s lives. China will con­tinue to pro­vide af­ford­able sup­port and as- sis­tance to other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries un­der the ini­tia­tive. 7. A road of clean govern­ment Clean govern­ment is the moral prin­ci­ple and the le­gal red line that we should never cross in Belt and Road coop- er­a­tion. All par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries should work to­gether to foster a mod­ern busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment which is cor­rup­tion- free and ef­fi­cient, strengthen su­per­vi­sion and man­age­ment and con­trol risk in Belt and Road projects, and cre­ate a pub­lic re­source mar­ket which is pro­ce­dure-based and trans- par­ent. Dur­ing the ten­der­ing, con­struc­tion, and op­er­a­tional man­age­ment of a project, we should abide by re­lated laws and reg­u­la­tions, elim­i­nate power rent-seek­ing, and estab- lish sound mar­ket or­der. All B&R coun­tries should en­hance in­ter­na­tional exchanges and co­op­er­a­tion in fight­ing cor­rup- tion. In ac­cor­dance with the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion Against Cor­rup­tion and other in­ter­na­tional con­ven­tions and re­lated bi­lat­eral treaties, we should cre­ate a closer and more con­ve­nient net­work for co­op­er­a­tion on ju­di­cial af­fairs and law en­force­ment, and fa­cil­i­tate the sign­ing and ful­fill­ment of bi­lat­eral ex­tra­di­tion treaties and ju­di­cial as­sis­tance agree- ments. All coun­tries should en­cour­age their en­ter­prises to strengthen self-dis­ci­pline, es­tab­lish rule-based man­age­rial sys­tems, foster an en­ter­prise cul­ture that val­ues in­tegrity, mon­i­tor cor­rup­tion risks, and op­pose com­mer­cial bribery. Govern­ment, en­ter­prises and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity should work to­gether to form co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms for deny­ing the en­try of cor­rupt of­fi­cials and re­turn­ing as­sets ac­quired through cor­rup­tion. The three par­ties should make con­certed ef­forts to cut chains of cor­rup­tion and forge lines of de­fense against cor­rup­tion. China is will­ing to join all other coun­tries in im­prov­ing the le­gal sys­tems and mech­a­nisms to fight cor­rup­tion, im- prov­ing the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, and pun­ish­ing com­mer- cial bribery. China will im­prove co­or­di­na­tion with other B&R coun­tries in an­ti­cor­rup­tion laws and reg­u­la­tions, and en­hance prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion against cor­rup­tion. China will in­crease anti-cor­rup­tion train­ing for Chi­nese en­ter- prises go­ing global, and tighten up their rule-based busi- ness oper­a­tion and man­age­ment. China is will­ing to work to­gether with other par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to build the Belt and Road into a road of clean govern­ment. The tides of world de­vel­op­ment roll on. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive mir­rors the gen­eral trend of his­tory. The val­ues and de­vel­op­ment con­cepts man­i­fested in the ini­tia- tive ful­fill the de­mands of hu­man so­ci­ety to form a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture. They meet the ex­pec­ta­tions of all peo­ples in the par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries to share de­velop- ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and live a bet­ter life. Un­doubt­edly, as time moves on, Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion will show great- er vi­tal­ity and cre­ativ­ity. With mas­ter plans and con­crete mea­sures in place, Belt and Road co­op­er­a­tion will reap long-term ben­e­fits as we per­se­vere in our ef­forts to­ward higher-qual­ity and higher-level de­vel­op­ment. The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive will help build a world of last­ing peace, a world of com­mon se­cu­rity and pros­per­ity, an open and in­clu­sive world, and a clean and beau­ti­ful world, mak­ing a greater con­tri­bu­tion to build­ing a global com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20200202,Sadc stance on sanc­tions com­mend­able,"THERE is a gen­eral ac­knowl­edge­ment that economic sanc­tions lead to an in­crease in the poverty gap and the un­der­priv­i­leged sec­tions of the pop­u­la­tion feel the most im­pact. In a jour­nal ti­tled “Im­pact of Economic sanc­tions on poverty and economic growth”, Dy­lan O’Driscoll says sanc­tions tend to harm ru­ral and non­in­dus­tri­alised ar­eas more, as re­sources are re­fo­cused in power and pro­duc­tion cen­tres. He said the neg­a­tive im­pact that sanc­tions have on economic growth af­fect women, mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties and other marginalised groups to a greater ex­tent. In short, sanc­tions have a sig­nif­i­cant neg­a­tive im­pact on the liv­ing stan­dards and hu­man­i­tar­ian sit­u­a­tion of the pop­u­la­tion in the sanc­tioned state. What this there­fore sug­gests is that noth­ing good comes out of sanc­tions. It is be­hind that back­ground that Sadc has come out in full force to sup­port calls for the re­moval of the il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe by United States of Amer­ica and its al­lies in 2002. The sanc­tions saw the coun­try fail to do busi­ness in some parts of the world, lead­ing to re­duc­tion in pro­duc­tion and loss of jobs to many people. The sanc­tions have had far reach­ing con­se­quences in the so­cial and economic spheres of life. That is why they have to be re­moved as a mat­ter of ur­gency. Last week, Sadc ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Dr Ster­gom­ena Tax met the United States Am­bas­sador to Botswana and re­it­er­ated the re­gional bloc’s calls for the re­moval of sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe by the coun­try and its al­lies. In a state­ment on its Twit­ter han­dle the re­gional body said Dr Tax also re­it­er­ated the need to fur­ther en­gage on re­forms that will lead to Zim­babwe’s economic re­cov­ery. “Sadc ES @DrTaxs met with the Am­bas­sador of USA to Botswana, H.E. Craig Cloud where @DrTaxs re­it­er­ated Sadc’s call for the im­me­di­ate re­moval of sanc­tions on #Zim­babwe & the need to fur­ther en­gage on re­forms that will see a re­cov­ery of the coun­try’s econ­omy,” read the Tweet. Dr Tax also Tweeted say­ing there was need to walk the talk in sup­port of Zim­babwe’s on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal and economic re­forms. “Thank you YE Amb Cloud for vis­it­ing the Sec­re­tariat, & for the ex­ten­sive dis­cus­sions on the im­pact of sanc­tions on the econ­omy of Zim and Zim­bab­weans and the need to walk the talk in sup­port­ing the on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal and economic re­forms in Zim­babwe,” said Dr Tax. In Au­gust last year, Sadc re­solved to set aside Oc­to­ber 25 as the sol­i­dar­ity day against il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe and re­solved to con­duct var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties in their re­spec­tive coun­tries on the day to call for the im­me­di­ate re­moval of the economic em­bargo. The re­gional cam­paign widened be­yond the re­gional bloc to the en­tire con­ti­nent when the African Union (AU) voiced its ob­jec­tions to the sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe call­ing for their im­me­di­ate re­moval. In­ter­na­tion­ally, China, Cuba and the Non-Aligned Move­ment made strong calls for the re­moval of the sanc­tions. Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Mr Richard Ma­homva said the stance by Dr Tax re­flects Sadc’s com­mit­ment in the cam­paign against sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe. “I think what arises is that Sadc is still res­o­lute on the 25th of Oc­to­ber move­ment and that what hap­pened on the 25th of Oc­to­ber was not po­lit­i­cal grand­stand­ing but rather an ul­ti­mate post-colo­nial po­si­tion which should be con­tin­ued by African coun­tries in de­fence of the in­ter­ests of the na­tion­al­ist move­ments that have been peren­ni­ally af­fected by neo­colo­nial forces. There­fore, the po­si­tion by Dr Tax re­flects Africa’s com­mit­ment to dis­en­tan­gle the relics of im­pe­ri­al­ism.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180516,China’s strat­egy in Africa: Think­ing deeply but mov­ing cau­tiously,"IN JUST one week from March 29 to April 4, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has warmly wel­comed heads of state of Namibia and Zim­babwe. Both coun­tries are lo­cated in South­ern Africa, with huge po­ten­tials to be­come great and wealthy play­ers. In ad­di­tion, two coun­tries have agreed with China to es­tab­lish or to up­grade bi­lat­eral com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship. It is self-ev­i­dent that Africa has been one of the key parts of China’s over­all strat­egy in for­eign af­fairs. Now the ques­tion is why the lead­ers of both Namibia and Zim­babwe vis­ited China closely one af­ter an­other, and then what can they do to en­hance China’s grow­ing in­ter­ests and in­flu­ence on the African con­ti­nent since Bei­jing’s in­ten­tion has been ques­tioned by the West? It was re­ported that for­mer US Sec­re­tary of State Rex Tiller­son vis­ited Africa dur­ing his last trip in March when he openly at­tacked China’s in­vest­ment pol­icy in Africa, say­ing it aimed at pro­mot­ing China’s own in­ter­ests rather than the in­ter­ests of African states. Un­doubt­edly, his re­marks were de­clined by the AU Chair­man Moussa Faki Ma­hamat. His­tor­i­cally speak­ing, China and ma­jor­ity of African states have been good part­ners and some of them are called all­weather friends. Both Namibia and Zim­babwe are among the lat­ter group. For ex­am­ple, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa came to China in the 1960s for mil­i­tary train­ing. As he told the Chi­nese me­dia, he had great ad­mi­ra­tion for Chi­nese lead­ers’ ef­forts and courage to com­bat cor­rup­tion and to elim­i­nate ru­ral poverty. Dur­ing his visit to Bei­jing, Pres­i­dent Xi con­curred with Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa that the two coun­tries stood by each other no mat­ter how in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions changed. The two sides vow to con­tinue high-level ex­changes, draw the blue­print for co­op­er­a­tion in all ar­eas and keep sup­port­ing each other on is­sues re­lated to core in­ter­ests and ma­jor con­cerns. Con­sid­er­ing that there are new op­por­tu­ni­ties for the de­vel­op­ment of China-Zim­babwe re­la­tions, Pres­i­dent Xi said there were joint ef­forts with Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa to draw a new blue­print of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions aimed at bring­ing more ben­e­fits for the peo­ple of both sides. More specif­i­cally, the two coun­tries should en­hance their strate­gic in­ter­con­nec­tion, deepen co­op­er­a­tion un­der the frame­work of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and con­tinue to co­op­er­ate in such ar­eas as in­fra­struc­ture, agri­cul­ture and fi­nance. In re­sponse to Pres­i­dent Xi’s re­marks, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said he hoped to de­velop so­cial­ism with Zim­bab­wean char­ac­ter­is­tics in his coun­try in light of Pres­i­dent Xi’s vi­sion on China’s. To that end, Zim­babwe seeks to tap into the huge fi­nan­cial re­sources, tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise and mod­ern tech­nol­ogy of its all-weather friend -China. Clearly, China would be able to play the sound role in Zim­babwe as it is seek­ing deeper eco­nomic ties with China to leapfrog its econ­omy bat­tered by years of West­ern sanc­tions. In the same way, China has worked steadily to pro­mote its bi­lat­eral ties with Namibia that has a huge land with rich re­sources and less pop­u­la­tion. On March 29, Pres­i­dent Xi held talks with Pres­i­dent Gein­gob, fol­lowed by a joint agree­ment to es­tab­lish China-Namibia com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship. As Xi re­called that both coun­tries and the two rul­ing par­ties have en­joyed a pro­found tra­di­tional friend­ship which could be traced to their com­mon strug­gle against im­pe­ri­al­ism and colo­nial­ism, sup­ported each other in na­tional re­con­struc­tion and con­tin­u­ously con­sol­i­dated friendly co­op­er­a­tion. Now as the two coun­tries have en­tered new de­vel­op­ment stages, they share sim­i­lar gov­er­nance phi­los­o­phy and have com­ple­men­tary ad­van­tages in their eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion. As an “all-weather” friend of Namibia, China is ready to work with it to boost bi­lat­eral re­la­tions for con­tin­u­ous steady and pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment so as to bet­ter ben­e­fit the two peo­ples. Here, Pres­i­dent Xi smartly stressed that by com­bin­ing with re­spec­tive ad­van­tages, the two sides would be able to grasp the pri­or­ity ar­eas and key projects. Pres­i­dent Xi wel­comed Namibia to ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in the “Belt and Road” ini­tia­tive and ex­pressed will­ing­ness to jointly strengthen pol­icy con­sul­ta­tion and align­ment of plans as well as fa­cil­i­tat­ing co­op­er­a­tion in key ar­eas. To that end, China stands ready to in­ten­sify co­op­er­a­tion with Namibia in wildlife pro­tec­tion, with zero tol­er­ance to il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties such as smug­gling of wildlife prod­ucts and oth­ers. Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Gein­gob re­it­er­ated that China has never colonised and plun­dered Africa and al­ways treated small and medium-sized African coun­tries as equal part­ners. As China sup­ported Africa’s just cause in his­tory and con­tin­u­ously help Africa’s de­vel­op­ment to­day, it is seen as Africa’s sin­cere part­ner and friend. He re­it­er­ated that Namibia ac­tively sup­ports co­op­er­a­tion un­der the frame­work of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion, and en­hance­ment of co­or­di­na­tion and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs. It is be­lieved that China and Africa will join hands to build a closer com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture for China and Africa and con­stantly in­ject new im­pe­tus into the de­vel­op­ment of China-Africa re­la­tions. In sum, both Namibia and Zim­babwe have demon­strated their will­ing­ness to par­tic­i­pate in the his­toric project of “the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive” pro­posed by Pres­i­dent Xi, as Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa openly hailed it as a grand vi­sion for the fu­ture. Due to this, both Zim­babwe and Namibia are among the coun­tries that have em­braced it. Un­doubt­edly, China and its pro­posed “BRI” will en­hance global trade for the ben­e­fit of all coun­tries’ econ­omy. Con­sid­er­ing the deeply-rooted legacy of colo­nial­ism and neo-colo­nial­ism, China’s strat­egy in Africa is highly ad­vised to think deeply but move cau­tiously. Af­ter all, it is a long-process for China to learn “for­eign af­fairs” in prac­tice. Agen­cies.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210108,What hap­pens to African en­ergy in­dus­try if lenders cut off loans for fos­sil fuel projects?,"A LIT­TLE more than a year ago, in Novem­ber 2019, the Euro­pean In­vest­ment Bank (EIB) de­clared its in­ten­tion to phase out fund­ing for fos­sil fu­els. Specif­i­cally, it said that it would no longer grant loans for projects in­volv­ing crude oil, nat­u­ral gas, and coal as of Jan­uary 1, 2022 (with a scant few ex­cep­tions for gas projects that meet rig­or­ous en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­te­ria). In mak­ing this an­nounce­ment, the EIB made his­tory. It be­came the first ma­jor multi-lat­eral fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion to make a pub­lic com­mit­ment to aban­don fos­sil fu­els in the name of com­bat­ting cli­mate change. Its pledge did not go un­no­ticed. In Oc­to­ber 2020, Antonio Guter­res, the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the United Na­tions (UN), called on the world’s pub­licly funded de­vel­op­ment banks to fol­low suit. Less than a month later, all 450 of these in­sti­tu­tions — in­clud­ing, in­ci­den­tally, the African De­vel­op­ment Bank Group (AfDB) — agreed to bring their lend­ing poli­cies into line with the Paris cli­mate ac­cord. The agree­ment did not in­clude a cat­e­gor­i­cal ban on fos­sil fuel loans, since some of the lenders in­volved, such as the Asian De­vel­op­ment Bank (ADB), were un­will­ing to make this com­mit­ment. How­ever, a group of Euro­pean lenders did ex­actly that — and they were hardly alone in do­ing so. You see, pub­lic de­vel­op­ment banks are not the only in­sti­tu­tions to have made cli­mate com­mit­ments. Since the be­gin­ning of 2020, a num­ber of ma­jor pri­vate lenders — in­clud­ing but not lim­ited to giants such as Bar­clays, HSBC, and Mor­gan Stan­ley — have rolled out plans to reach net-zero in green­house gas (GHG) emis­sions by 2050. Oth­ers — such as Black­rock, a ma­jor as­set man­age­ment firm — have pledged to make more money avail­able for re­new­able en­ergy projects. And just a few weeks ago, South Africa’s Stan­dard Bank Group joined the cho­rus, say­ing it would no longer fund fos­sil fuel projects un­less the spon­sors could demon­strate com­pli­ance with strict en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards. And it is not just the banks. Cli­mate con­sid­er­a­tions are now driv­ing some of the world’s largest oil and gas firms, with multi-na­tional giants such as BP and Royal Dutch/Shell and slightly smaller op­er­a­tors such as Oc­ci­den­tal Petroleum, aim­ing to hit the net-zero mark by 2050. They may also come to drive the U.S. gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies, as Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den has de­clared cli­mate change one of the first pri­or­i­ties of his ad­min­is­tra­tion. Is this a tip­ping point? So what next? Should I fol­low the Bloomberg news agency’s ex­am­ple and talk about 2020 as a tip­ping point for cli­mate ac­tivism? Should I try to ex­tend the story I out­lined above into the fu­ture and paint this year as the be­gin­ning of the end for fos­sil fu­els? That is not what I want to do. That is not what I want to hap­pen. In­stead, I will try to ex­plain why I think the move away from fi­nanc­ing fos­sil fuel projects has the po­ten­tial to hurt Africa. And I am go­ing to do it by imag­in­ing what might hap­pen if this move con­tin­ues. Cli­mate con­cerns? In this sce­nario, cli­mate con­cerns come to dic­tate the lend­ing poli­cies of Western fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. By 2025, all of the world’s pub­licly funded de­vel­op­ment banks have joined the EIB in de­clin­ing to fund fos­sil fuel projects (even though a se­lect few or­gan­i­sa­tions are still man­ag­ing to at­tract small-scale cred­i­tors af­ter agree­ing to adopt oner­ous and costly car­bon off­set ar­range­ments). Pri­vate lenders have fol­lowed suit, mak­ing it known that they will only sup­port re­new­able en­ergy schemes (and that they pre­fer to do busi­ness with com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments that fall in line with their own net-zero pledges). As far as the lead­ers of these fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions are con­cerned, they have done the right thing. They have done their part to up­hold the Paris agree­ment and pre­vent the dis­as­ters caused by cli­mate change. They have re­sponded to the con­cerns of the pub­lic (and of their share­hold­ers). And are not fos­sil fu­els a risky in­vest­ment nowa­days? Af­ter all, de­mand never quite re­cov­ered af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic hit, and prices have stayed rather low. Oil and gas are quite out of fash­ion now, re­ally! The view from Africa But the view from Africa is likely to be dif­fer­ent. In Africa, cli­mate con­sid­er­a­tions and ide­o­log­i­cal com­mit­ments to elim­i­nat­ing GHG emis­sions may well take a back seat to more ur­gent ques­tions about how to en­cour­age eco­nomic growth and sup­ply ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties to the con­ti­nent’s grow­ing pop­u­la­tion. In coun­tries with large nat­u­ral gas re­serves such as Mozam­bique, Tan­za­nia, South Africa, Nige­ria, Al­ge­ria, Equa­to­rial Guinea, Ghana, Cameroon, Sene­gal, and many oth­ers, politi­cians, busi­ness­men and ev­ery­day peo­ple should ask their western coun­ter­parts why they should de­cline to ex­tract a re­source that could be used to pro­duce elec­tric­ity cheaply and re­li­ably for both house­holds and busi­nesses. They should ask why they should forego the op­por­tu­nity to de­velop an in­dus­try that cre­ates jobs, both di­rectly and in­di­rectly, and pro­motes trade with neigh­bour­ing states that also need en­ergy. They should ask why they are be­ing dis­cour­aged from us­ing the least pol­lut­ing of the fos­sil fu­els and pushed to­wards re­new­able en­ergy solutions that are less re­li­able and more ex­pen­sive per unit of power gen­er­ated. They should ask why Africa should be punished for Western na­tions GHG emis­sions. They should ask what hap­pens to en­ergy poverty. They should ask who will pay repa­ra­tions to Africa if Africans have to aban­don their nat­u­ral re­sources. They may also ask why they should make the same sac­ri­fices as Western coun­tries when they do not have the same ad­van­tages as those coun­tries — in­clud­ing, say, the com­ple­ment of legacy, gas-fired power plants needed to en­sure that elec­tric­ity sup­plies con­tinue all day and night, without in­ter­rup­tion, even at times when the wind is not blow­ing, and the sun is not shin­ing. Africans should also ques­tion the need to leave crude oil in the ground — and they should! For many of them, their oil in­dus­try and ser­vice com­pa­nies are a ma­jor source of in­come. And while they may be will­ing to see that source phased out grad­u­ally, they’re not likely to as­sent to plans for killing them off abruptly. Also, what about in­de­pen­dent African ex­plo­ration and pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies? What about African oil­field ser­vice com­pa­nies and mid­stream op­er­a­tors? Shouldn’t they have a say in their fu­ture too? Mean­while, what about all the time and re­sources that a num­ber of African lead­ers have in­vested in cre­at­ing poli­cies that en­cour­age in­ter­na­tional oil com­pa­nies to in­vest in their coun­tries, from im­proved fis­cal regimes to trans­parency laws to win­win lo­cal con­tent poli­cies? There is no ques­tion that these lead­ers were in­ter­ested in oil rev­enue, but there is so much more to gain from these poli­cies, from much-needed tech­nol­ogy trans­fers to busi­ness and growth op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal en­trepreneurs. In the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic, African economies need these op­por­tu­ni­ties more than ever. Leav­ing China as the only op­tion Amidst all these ques­tions, there may be a few de­ter­mined types who seek to push for­ward with up­stream oil and gas de­vel­op­ment de­spite the lack of sup­port from Western banks. Heads of state may try to sub­sidise gas projects (or pro­vide other forms of sup­port) in an at­tempt to build up do­mes­tic ca­pac­i­ties and pro­mote self-suf­fi­ciency in en­ergy. En­trepreneurs may reach into their own pock­ets or work to drum up lo­cal sup­port, in the hope of us­ing abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources to turn out prod­ucts for which there is de­mand. Without ac­cess to Western cap­i­tal, such ini­tia­tives are more likely to fail — or, at least, to fal­ter. If so, their back­ers may very well look for sup­port else­where. And they may find it in China, which has been very will­ing to pro­vide fi­nan­cial and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance for fos­sil fuel projects in Africa. Per­son­ally, I find the prospect of Bei­jing be­com­ing the main source of out­side fi­nanc­ing for African oil, gas, and gas-topower projects to be con­cern­ing. I am not say­ing this be­cause I think African states ought to shy away from co­op­er­a­tion with China. I am say­ing it be­cause I want them to have as many op­tions as pos­si­ble. I want them to be ready to work with a wide range of part­ners, rather than fall into a pat­tern of not hav­ing to look fur­ther than sat­is­fy­ing China’s re­quire­ments. And this will not hap­pen if Western lenders cut off fund­ing for African oil and gas projects as a con­se­quence of their com­mit­ment to curb­ing cli­mate change. In­stead, China will come to have more in­flu­ence than any other party over the African oil and gas sec­tor. China, which has al­ready put a num­ber of African coun­tries in the po­si­tion of hand­ing over im­por­tant as­sets when they find them­selves un­able to keep up with loan pay­ments. China, which has a less-than-stel­lar track record on en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, de­spite be­ing a sig­na­tory to the Paris cli­mate ac­cord. Time to make a case for oil and gas As I have al­ready said, this is not the out­come I want. In­stead, I think Africa should have the chance to use its own oil and gas to strengthen it­self es­pe­cially with the com­ing into force of the Africa Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Agree­ment. I also think Africa should have more than one op­tion when it comes to fi­nanc­ing petroleum projects. Most of all, I think Africa should have the chance to make its own choices without un­due pres­sure from Western in­sti­tu­tions that don’t face the same chal­lenges. Africans have to be­come more vis­i­ble, more vo­cal and even more hope­ful about the fu­ture and the en­ergy sec­tor. As a re­sult, I think African states ought to push back against the idea that it’s time for Western banks to stop all fund­ing for fos­sil fu­els. I think that African oil and gas pro­duc­ers ought to stand up for them­selves and make a case for de­vel­op­ing their own re­sources — par­tic­u­larly for us­ing the least-pol­lut­ing fos­sil fu­els to de­liver as much elec­tric­ity as pos­si­ble to as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble. And the time to make that case is now, while fi­nanc­ing for oil and gas is still avail­able.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20201011,Let’s not be a na­tion of whin­ers,"THE ob­jec­tive of Vi­sion 2030, to cre­ate an up­per mid­dle-in­come econ­omy in 10 years or less, can­not be at­tained if Zim­bab­weans do not rally un­der a com­mon na­tional goal. Zim­babwe’s abun­dant land and nat­u­ral re­sources can change the coun­try’s eco­nomic for­tunes dras­ti­cally if the peo­ple share a com­mon vi­sion as a na­tion and work hard to make th­ese re­sources work for the ben­e­fit of all Zim­bab­weans with­out leav­ing oth­ers be­hind. We need to re­mind our­selves to work tire­lessly to build “the Zim­babwe we want”, lever­ag­ing on our abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources and hu­man ca­pa­bil­i­ties for the ben­e­fit of cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. We are a hard-work­ing and re­silient peo­ple — we have faced many chal­lenges be­fore — colo­nial­ism, lib­er­a­tion strug­gle, se­vere droughts, eco­nomic melt­down, hy­per­in­fla­tion, epi­demics — you name it — we have seen it all. We have pre­vailed over th­ese chal­lenges be­cause we put our dif­fer­ences aside and ral­lied to­gether as a na­tion for the com­mon good. We fought for our in­de­pen­dence with little re­sources com­pared to the mil­i­tary might of the Ian Smith regime, fear­less and un­de­terred we risked our lives and made the ul­ti­mate sac­ri­fices that any hu­man be­ing can make. This re­silience should gal­vanise us to face the chal­lenges of build­ing a bet­ter Zim­babwe for all of us. Vi­sion 2030 can­not be achieved if we do not main­tain the same vigour, com­mit­ment, self­less­ness and courage that we have dis­played as a na­tion when faced with chal­lenges that look in­sur­mount­able. As we look into the fu­ture de­vel­op­ment and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion of our coun­try, let us not talk and be­have as if Zim­babwe be­longs to other peo­ple, it be­longs to us, all of us. As such we should guard jeal­ously our coun­try and all that be­longs to it and use all our re­sources to build a bet­ter coun­try, a bet­ter fu­ture for our chil­dren. We need to lift our eyes and see be­yond ob­sta­cles that lie in our path. The “Zim­babwe we want” can­not be cre­ated if we re­main di­vided and pull each other down. This at­ti­tude is not sus­tain­able and only serves to re­tard our de­vel­op­ment. Re­sources While we can­not di­vorce our­selves from the global fi­nan­cial ar­chi­tec­ture, we should not over rely on other coun­tries. The move by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa to look in­wards through mo­bil­i­sa­tion of our own re­sources in the de­vel­op­ment of our coun­try, is be­gin­ning to bear fruit. This is what coun­tries like China, Sin­ga­pore and United Arab Emi­rates did. They are what they are to­day be­cause they looked in­wards, to their own peo­ple and at their own re­source en­dow­ments, and used th­ese to spur their de­vel­op­ment and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion. De­vel­op­ment part­ners and for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment should not be used as the pri­mary source to drive Zim­babwe to­wards Vi­sion 2030, but should be used to aug­ment or sup­port our home grown de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes. Only Zim­bab­weans not de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance, aid, donors or free­bies can spur our as­pired growth tar­gets and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion as­pi­ra­tions un­der Vi­sion 2030. We should as a na­tion be pre­pared to go into trenches, get dirty and work hard for the de­vel­op­ment of our great coun­try and for the ben­e­fit of cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. Beg­ging bowls The Zim­babwe en­vi­sioned un­der Vi­sion 2030 will only come about through hard work, com­mit­ment and a de­sire to up­lift our­selves from poverty. Th­ese qual­i­ties should be etched in our DNA. Set­tling for sec­ond best — mediocrity — is sim­ply un­ac­cept­able. Home grown so­lu­tions are the way to go. Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions’ pro­grammes will not trans­form our great coun­try. IMF and WB pro­grammes can only aug­ment what we have set our­selves to achieve as a na­tion. The driver of our eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion is our own peo­ple, our own re­sources, our will and our com­mit­ment. De­vel­op­ment aid, as our his­tory shows, has not al­ways worked in our best in­ter­ests as most deals are tilted in favour of de­vel­op­ment part­ners or donors, re­in­forc­ing un­der­ly­ing un­even power bal­ances be­tween de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Some non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) that we rely on do not have good in­ten­tions for Zim­babwe. Their aid comes with po­lit­i­cal mo­tives, while “win­dow dressed” as de­vel­op­ment aid, when in fact, the agenda be­hind such aid is not de­vel­op­ment, but a con­tin­u­a­tion of im­pe­ri­al­ist po­lit­i­cal agenda for desta­bil­is­ing African coun­tries and per­pet­u­at­ing the colo­nial donor-re­cip­i­ent sub­servient sta­tus-quo. If de­vel­op­ment aid is taken whole­sale, be­cause we are des­per­ate for fund­ing, our eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tions un­der Vi­sion 2030 will be im­paired. There are so many things we can do within Zim­babwe. Hard work, in­no­va­tion, good eco­nomic poli­cies, fis­cal dis­ci­pline, fight­ing cor­rup­tion and loot­ing of pub­lic re­sources are some of the things we can do our­selves to safe­guard our re­sources and avail them for eco­nomic growth, job cre­ation and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. In­gre­di­ents Unity, in­no­va­tion, hard work and dis­ci­pline are key in­gre­di­ents for at­tain­ing Vi­sion 2030. Th­ese in­gre­di­ents can change the face of our great coun­try and bring about change in a rel­a­tively short pe­riod of time and even in the most ex­tra­or­di­nary dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tions.

And since the United States and its al­lies im­posed sanc­tions on the coun­try at the turn of the mil­len­nium to stran­gle Zim­babwe into ca­pit­u­la­tion and re­verse the land re­form pro­gramme, the coun­try has missed on ac­cess­ing loans from in­ter­na­tional lenders such as the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions while suc­ces­sive droughts and the out­break of pan­demics such as Covid19 have ex­ac­er­bated the sit­u­a­tion. The study was done by the In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Re-En­gage­ment Com­mit­tee of the Po­lit­i­cal Ac­tors Di­a­logue ( POLAD) es­tab­lished. “Against a back­drop of a mul­ti­tude of chal­lenges, such as more ex­treme weather caused by cli­mate change and the pub­lic health and eco­nomic dev­as­ta­tion caused by the Covid19 pan­demic, our coun­try has been able to make sig­nif­i­cant re­form and put Zim­babwe on a pos­i­tive jour­ney for­ward. “How­ever, we re­main un­der sanc­tions that are mo­ti­vated by a de­sire to slowly weaken the na­tion, leav­ing Zim­babwe vul­ner­a­ble to poverty, droughts and epi­demics that erode na­tional co­he­sion and con­fi­dence. The US gov­ern­ment’s sanc­tions are silently de­stroy­ing the eco­nomic, cul­tural and mo­ral fab­ric of Zim­babwe with per­sis­tent, vague, board stroke mea­sures and mis­in­for­ma­tion” reads the Polad re­port in part. And con­trary to the as­ser­tions by the US that the sanc­tions are tar­geted, the study ex­poses the hypocrisy of the Western world as it en­gages in an eco­nomic war­fare against Zim­babwe for daring to re­unite the land with its people. “Th is is ev­i­denced by the fact that the 2003 Ex­ec­u­tive Or­der 13288 sanc­tions by Ge­orge Bush were evoked through the In­ter­na­tional Emer­gency Eco­nomic Pow­ers Act ( IEEPA) and Na­tional Emer­gency Act (NEA) us­ing war and de­fence pro­vi­sions. Through it, Zim­babwe, in a suc­ces­sion of two amend­ments ( SO 13341 & SO 13469) was spec­i­fied as an un­usual and ex­tra­or­di­nary threat to US in­ter­ests, na­tional se­cu­rity and or eco­nomic in­ter­ests”. Th rough such leg­is­la­tion “the US gov­ern­ment has es­tab­lished ex­pressed in­stru­ments and aug­mented them with pres­i­den­tial dis­cre­tion to in­ves­ti­gate, per­mit, li­cense, limit, block, con­fis­cate and pro­hibit (by mere in­struc­tion) any pay­ments, trans­fers, fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions, trade, alien­ation of prop­erty and busi­ness trans­ac­tions be­tween US na­tion­als, banks, busi­nesses, global busi­nesses and Zim­babwe, its in­sti­tu­tions, per­sons and busi­nesses”. Fur­ther, the re­port says, were it not be­cause of the veto power that was used by Rus­sia and China in the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. Th e coun­try could have been placed on the UN sanc­tions in a brazen at­tempt by Western na­tions to re­verse the land re­form pro­gramme. Zim­babwe has two sets of sanc­tions in ef­fect against it. The first were in­sti­tuted in 2001 as an act of Congress af­ter Zim­babwe’s land re­form. These are the in­fa­mous S494 ZDERA 2001 sanc­tions which were just ex­tended in Au­gust 2018. “Con­trary to the claim that they are tar­geted at politi­cians and their com­pa­nies, the ZDERA sanc­tions are tar­geted squarely at dis­abling the Zim­bab­wean fi nan­cial sys­tem by us­ing US gov­ern­ment direc­tors in mul­ti­lat­eral lend­ing in­sti­tu­tions to block any debt can­cel­la­tion, ex­ten­sion of loans to Zim­babwe and or the con­tin­u­a­tion of any de­vel­op­men­tal project loans that were signed in Zim­babwe’s favour pre­vi­ously,” reads the state­ment in part. With the Se­cond Repub­lic hav­ing turned a new chap­ter through open­ing up of the demo­cratic space, as ev­i­denced by the po­lit­i­cal plu­ral­ism that led to the for­ma­tion of Polad and its re-en­gage­ment ef­forts get­ting the buy in from most of the world as re­flected in the forth­com­ing Anti-Sanc­tions Day on Oc­to­ber 25, the con­tin­ued ex­is­tence of the il­le­gal sanc­tions is no longer jus­tifi able “Zim­babwe has be­gun to im­ple­ment chap­ter 16 of its Con­sti­tu­tion sec­tion 295 (1) (2) that ad­dresses the anom­alies on the land re­form and par­tic­u­larly sub-clause the com­pen­sa­tion to white farm­ers on the farm im­prove­ments. “As Polad we un­der­stand that the land re­form was the main rea­son for the im­po­si­tion of these sanc­tions. The United States has to ac­knowl­edge the mile­stones that have been reached by the gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe and the Com­mer­cial Farm­ers Union in com­ing up with the Global Com­pen­sa­tion Deed that will go a long way in ad­dress­ing the is­sues of prop­erty rights and due com­pen­sa­tions. US 3,5 bil­lion has been mu­tu­ally agreed on. “There have been po­lit­i­cal and le­gal re­forms that Zim­babwe has im­ple­mented, the re­peal of AIPPA and POSA which are now at in­ter­na­tional ac­cept­able stan­dards. “On this day, Polad does not only com­mem­o­rate the pa­tri­otic com­mit­ment by op­po­si­tion par­ties to be in sol­i­dar­ity on the un­con­di­tional re­moval of sanc­tions, we also ap­plaud the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe for these pro­gres­sive po­lit­i­cal re­forms and at the same time re­buke and im­plore on the hypocrisy of the United States of Amer­ica for not tak­ing note of our im­proved and ma­tur­ing democ­racy. “The 25th of Oc­to­ber is a day for sin­cere and pa­tri­otic politi­cians from the rul­ing party and op­po­si­tion to set aside their po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences and speak in sol­i­dar­ity against the USA uni­lat­er­ally im­posed sanc­tions on Zim­babwe and their im­pact on the so­cioe­co­nomic sta­tus of Zim­babwe”. Civic or­gan­i­sa­tions, op­po­si­tion par­ties, the church and tra­di­tional lead­ers have added their voices for the un­con­di­tional re­moval of the eco­nomic sanc­tions that have bled Zim­babwe of bil­lions with the Gov­ern­ment re­veal­ing last week that with­out sanc­tions the coun­try could have been fly­ing high.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160520,World Bank axes ‘de­vel­op­ing coun­try’,"THE term “de­vel­op­ing coun­try” has of­fi­cially been axed by the World Bank — and it’s un­clear what it even meant in the first place. In its 2016 edi­tion of World Devel­op­ment In­di­ca­tors, the or­gan­i­sa­tion said it would no longer dis­tin­guish be­tween “de­vel­op­ing” and “de­vel­oped” coun­tries. It could mark an im­por­tant change in how the world views poverty and pro­gres­sion. Why make this change? The World Bank said the term was be­com­ing a less rel­e­vant way of clas­si­fy­ing coun­tries. It’s partly due to the suc­cess of devel­op­ment ef­forts in the last sev­eral decades. And now the or­gan­i­sa­tion is fo­cus­ing on “sus­tain­able devel­op­ment goals” for the whole world, and as a re­sult will stop sin­gling out the ‘de­vel­op­ing world’. Why does it mat­ter? This change marks an “evo­lu­tion” in think­ing about how poverty and pros­per­ity are spread around the globe, the World Bank said. In pub­lished data, there will no longer be a dis­tinc­tion be­tween “de­vel­op­ing” and “de­vel­oped” coun­tries — in­stead, they will be grouped re­gion­ally, for in­stance “East Asia”. That rep­re­sents a change to the world’s psy­che about how low and mid­dle-in­come na­tions should be con­sid­ered. Why wasn’t the term scrapped sooner? Or, rather, why was it in­tro­duced in the first place? Re­searchers have ad­mit­ted that there was never a uni­ver­sal agree­ment of what the terms meant when they were brought in. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund says its dis­tinc­tion be­tween ad­vanced and emerg­ing mar­ket economies ‘is not based on strict cri­te­ria, eco­nomic or oth­er­wise’. The United Na­tions doesn’t have an of­fi­cial def­i­ni­tion of a de­vel­op­ing coun­try ei­ther — de­spite at­tach­ing the la­bel to 159 na­tions. Sort­ing coun­tries into in­fla­tion-ad­justed brack­ets of low, mid­dle and high-in­come also shows why the term is flawed. China, Bo­livia, and Eritrea, which fall in three dif­fer­ent in­come groups, are all classed as ‘de­vel­op­ing’. Umar Ser­a­jud­din, a se­nior economist in the World Bank’s sta­tis­tics of­fice, said: “The main is­sue is that there is just so much het­ero­gene­ity be­tween Malawi and Malaysia for both to be clas­si­fied in the same group — Malaysia is more like the US than Malawi. “When we lump dis­parate coun­tries to­gether in the same group, it isn’t re­ally use­ful.” — Metro.uk",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170404,"China com­mits to global de­vel­op­ment, con­sid­ers Africa an im­por­tant part­ner","CHINA has pledged to con­tinue with an ac­tive role in pro­mot­ing global so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and con­sid­ers Africa as an im­por­tant part­ner in re­form­ing world af­fairs. This was part of the dis­cus­sion at the re­cent Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress (NPC) and the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Po­lit­i­cal Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence (CPPCC) of­ten re­ferred to as the “Two Ses­sions” held from March 5-15 in Beijing. The Two Ses­sions are a ma­jor pol­icy de­bate held an­nu­ally at this time, through which China re­views its na­tional, re­gional and global de­vel­op­ment pri­or­i­ties, and im­ple­men­ta­tion of an­nual and five-year plans. In re­view­ing the an­nual work plan, Chi­nese Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang said it is crit­i­cal for all coun­tries to con­tinue work­ing to­gether to re­vive the global econ­omy, which is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing some chal­lenges due to a num­ber of fac­tors. “All coun­tries must work to­gether on global trade,” Pre­mier Li said, adding that China will re­main an im­por­tant en­gine for global so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. He said China sup­ports glob­al­i­sa­tion, free trade as well as open­ing up its econ­omy, and the coun­try is al­ready in­volved in var­i­ous ini­tia­tives with dif­fer­ent part­ners to pro­mote global so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. One such ini­tia­tive is the One Belt One Road Strat­egy that was first an­nounced by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in 2013. Ti­tled “Vi­sions and Ac­tions on Jointly Build­ing Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt and 21st Cen­tury Mar­itime Silk Road” and col­lec­tively known as “Belt and Road”, this a de­vel­op­ment pol­icy with a holis­tic vision of eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity de­vel­op­ment to reach out and ini­ti­ate ac­tion to jointly build a new world or­der that is de­vel­op­ment-ori­ented, for mu­tual pros­per­ity and hu­man se­cu­rity. This vision for the over­land Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt, and the Mar­itime Silk Road by sea has the po­ten­tial to change the global po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic land­scape through rapid de­vel­op­ment of in­fra­struc­ture and trans­port cor­ri­dors of coun­tries along the routes, and the em­pha­sis is on “joint”. The ini­tia­tive will es­tab­lish new routes link­ing Asia, Africa and Europe. It has two parts — a new Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt link­ing China to Europe through Cen­tral Asia; and the Mar­itime Silk Road that links China’s ports with In­dia and the African coast and through Suez to Europe. There is al­ready sig­nif­i­cant im­pact in some coun­tries in Africa, and some ports are be­ing con­structed or re­con­structed in Mozambique, the United Repub­lic of Tanzania and Kenya. In Kenya, the Mom­basa-Nairobi Stan­dard Gauge Rail­way line (SGR) is one of the first en­try points in Africa and is al­ready tak­ing shape with the ini­tial ship­ment of lo­co­mo­tives re­ceived in Jan­uary. Sig­nif­i­cant re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion work has also been done at the port of Na­cala and re­lated road/rail in­fra­struc­ture in north­ern Mozambique. The SGR is ex­pected to con­nect other coun­tries in Africa in­clud­ing Rwanda and Uganda, as part of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 vision of a con­ti­nent in­ter­con­nected by road and rail. Var­i­ous fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions have been set up to fi­nance in­fra­struc­ture projects un­der the One Belt One Road Ini­tia­tive such as the Silk Road Fund, Asia In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank, and the New De­vel­op­ment Bank. Some of the do­mes­tic is­sues dis­cussed by the Two Ses­sions in Beijing in­clude un­em­ploy­ment and poverty re­duc­tion, a re­vi­sion on the 70-year land-use of prop­er­ties among oth­ers, and en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion in­clud­ing a smog re­search fund. A new fund will be set up to pool the knowl­edge of the coun­try’s top sci­en­tists to dis­cover the cause of smog that fre­quently blan­kets north­ern China in win­ter. For­eign pol­icy is­sues were dis­cussed in the con­text of the need to pro­mote global peace and sta­bil­ity as well as China’s role in re­form­ing world af­fairs. The NPC is China’s par­lia­ment in which 3 000 del­e­gates re­view the gov­ern­ment’s an­nual work re­port on re­sults for the pre­vi­ous year, draft pro­vi­sions of the law, and ap­prove the work plan for the com­ing year in the con­text of the tar­gets of the five-year plan.

of the world-order","ZIM­BABWE’S en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment over­drive un­der His Ex­cel­lency, Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa clearly sit­u­ates our tran­si­tional ex­pe­ri­ence within the broader and the most sought dy­namism of mod­ern state­craft. With Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s wide so­licit for an in­clu­sive mul­ti­lat­eral com­mit­ment base, an in­de­pen­dent ob­server can note that Zim­babwe is be­ing ush­ered into a moder­nity which is built on the solid strength of pro­gres­sive diplo­macy. While re­al­ism re­mains at the core of state to state in­ter­ac­tions, the world needs to rein­vent a re­al­ism couched on peace, equal eco­nomic growth and cul­tural in­te­gra­tion. In a world that is fast lean­ing to­wards com­plex in­ter­de­pen­dence and not the pri­mor­dial par­a­digm to power, it makes more sense for Zim­babwe to be seek­ing part­ner­ships which ad­vance eco­nomic growth, up­lift of the lives of the or­di­nary cit­i­zenry fol­low­ing the painful ham­mer of eco­nomic sanc­tions which have paral­ysed ev­ery facet of hu­man-life in Zim­babwe in the past decades. The con­tin­ued ri­fling of the sanc­tions dis­course in our face by Wash­ing­ton is a clear sign of sec­to­rial in­ter­est lobby and the de­lib­er­ate mis­sile tar­get­ing of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s hard diplo­matic of­fen­sive since 2017. The break-away from struc­tural rigidi­ties in our for­eign pol­icy should build new hopes for peace and sta­bil­ity. This is a tall order which re­quires hard dili­gence and apt com­mit­ment. China has made this route to be worth pur­su­ing. A lot can be learnt from China in this re­gard. In fact, the cur­rent con­struc­tion of power in China is a tem­plate and a model that can be used to struc­ture and nur­ture al­ter­na­tive thought to state-build­ing. China’s ap­proach to political con­struc­tion is mind open­ing and re­flec­tive. Mind open­ing in the sense that it ex­posed how our open-arms to en­gage and re-en­gage are giv­ing us ac­cess to many op­tions of re­build­ing our coun­try. China has shown the world that al­ter­na­tive di­men­sions to in­ter­na­tional re­al­ism do ex­ist be­yond nu­clear pro­lif­er­a­tion and interference. Re­al­ism is not about ag­gres­sive mo­nop­oly cap­i­tal and power cap­ture. Re­al­ism is not the crude modus operandi of dec­i­mat­ing weaker political ac­tors, in­stead, China has demon­strated how much re­al­ism is built on es­tab­lish­ing an egal­i­tar­ian order. For in­stance, China’s cur­rent eco­nomic progress can­not be traced to any form of im­pe­rial con­quest and in­va­sion. How­ever, this is not the case with sev­eral states who have catagorised them­selves as the “First-World/ De­vel­oped-World”. The oli­gop­oly dilemma con­tin­ues to be a punc­tu­at­ing con­tra­dic­tion for many states who have ar­ro­gated global supremacy. To­day we speak of the Global-North and the Global-South di­vide which is sus­tained by an un­even in­ter­ac­tion of world power. Here, the Global-North de­posits the morals, standards and val­ues to the Global-South in a bid to teach how economies should be man­aged. The Global-North is also a political moral pre­fect teach­ing the “ThirdWorld” hu­man-rights and democ­racy. China is a fast grow­ing global power and yet her for­eign pol­icy is not sig­nif­i­cantly hege­monic as ex­pected. China has main­tained an ar­dent non­in­ter­fer­ence prin­ci­ple. This a firm ges­ture which sub­stan­ti­ates the mag­ni­tude of China’s re­spect of the au­ton­omy of other nations. China has also man­aged to forego the propen­sity of ego con­sid­er­ing its strate­gic posit­ing in the global cap­i­tal hi­er­ar­chy. There­fore, the as­tute ra­tio­nal­ity of Zim­babwe’s cur­rent prox­im­ity to China through Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s open for­eign pol­icy sub­stan­ti­ates a well-de­fined lean­ing to­wards pro­gres­sive part­ner­ships. Here is China, a coun­try that was bat­tling with re­form and re­con­struc­tion a few decades ago just as we are do­ing cur­rently; to­day the same China is the Sec­ond-Best econ­omy of the world. It only makes em­pir­i­cal sense to strengthen bi­lat­eral ties with such a world power. On the other hand, it is also ex­pected to open the door for other friends and po­ten­tial friends. How­ever, it is his­tor­i­cally in­deli­ble that China is Zim­babwe’s unique and time­less friend. This bring me to my sec­ond im­por­tance point on the re­flec­tive thrust of China — as a his­tor­i­cal and an ide­o­log­i­cal beckon. Be­fore ris­ing to her con­tem­po­rary eco­nomic promi­nence, China shoul­dered the cost of Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle and that is in­dica­tive of friendly sac­ri­fice. Even af­ter in­de­pen­dence China did not keep a dis­tance from us. China re­mained clos­est to Zim­babwe even at a time ev­ery­one had ditched us be­cause we chose to do the right thing by giv­ing back the land to its right­ful own­ers. In the face of global per­se­cu­tion through sanc­tions and the call for Ar­ti­cle 7 of the United Nations to be evoked against Zim­babwe China re­mained con­sis­tent. It was at that point when we took a de­fi­ant po­si­tion to “Look-East”. To “Look East” was and is still no bur­den as it is equiv­a­lent to “Look­ing Within”. The fra­ter­nal re­la­tion­ship we have de­vel­oped over the years makes it no hard to draw in­spi­ra­tion from China. This re­la­tion­ship is now com­pli­mented by the “Xi Jin­ping thought on So­cial­ism with Chi­nese Char­ac­ter­is­tics for a New-Era”. This gov­er­nance model un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping of China of­fers a re­fresh­ing per­spec­tive to world pol­i­tics. Through this ap­proach China is ded­i­cat­ing its en­ergy to in­te­grat­ing the world’s marginalised coun­tries to con­trib­ute to a new world order. This has been seen through the suc­cess­ful ma­te­ri­al­i­sa­tion of the Fo­rum on Africa-China Co-op­er­a­tion (FOCAC). China has gen­er­ously handed mil­lions of dol­lars for ad­vanc­ing de­vel­op­ment ini­tia­tives in Africa, such a fund could be cru­cial in gen­er­at­ing projects which strengthen var­i­ous sec­tors of hu­man liveli­hoods in Africa. The FOCAC agenda also demon­strates China’s role in re­plac­ing the con­ven­tional aid model with growth an­chored aid for African economies. Con­trary to the ex­pected, af­ter the West’s mas­sive pour of aid in Africa, poverty re­mains un­ad­dressed, political in­sta­bil­ity is still preva­lent and some coun­tries are far from com­ing to peace af­ter many years of war. This could be a clear sign that this form of aid could be ac­tu­ally sus­tain­ing the cri­sis that Africa is cur­rently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing. There­fore, China’s hum­ble reach-out to Africa must be ap­plauded as it tes­ti­fies the need to re-order the world sys­tem. China’s open busi­ness part­ner­ships must be ex­ploited for the suc­cess of Africa’s grow­ing economies. In the case of Zim­babwe, our main­tained trans­ac­tional ties with China which go be­yond the petty aid relief nar­ra­tives which pro­mote the im­pe­rial facet of de­pen­dency and neo­colo­nial­ism. With­out doubt China has opened her door to grow with the pe­riph­eral forces of the global sphere. Zim­babwe is priv­i­leged to be China’s long-term ally and this is telling of an un­wa­ver­ing fra­ter­nal re­la­tion­ship of this two coun­tries. A fu­ture of shared pros­per­ity be­tween China and Zim­babwe is in­evitable. Zim­babwe must play her part in sus­tain­ing this re­la­tion­ship, but China also has to ex­ploit the “Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness” agenda to se­cure its in­ter­ests, at the same time help­ing Zim­babwe to un­lock its value-chain in the ar­eas of min­ing, agri­cul­ture and man­u­fac­tur­ing. The fast-grow­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween our coun­try and China is a reaf­fir­ma­tion of the past that we have shared. The ex­changes be­tween Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa and Xi Jin­ping sym­bol­ise the past’s rein­car­na­tion into the present. The re­la­tion­ship by these two Heads of State epit­o­mises the prospects of the diplo­matic per­ma­nence be­tween Harare and Bei­jing. This means that both coun­tries have a long chap­ter for the ben­e­fit of gen­er­a­tions to come. This long story des­tined for the pages of our fu­ture his­tory texts must leave lessons for the world that non­ex­ploita­tive in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal re­la­tions are pos­si­ble. The story of Zim­babwe and China must one day il­lus­trate the sci­en­tific mean­ing of sol­i­dar­ity and mu­tual ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. As it stands, China pro­vides very in­stru­men­tal tenets for the so­cioe­co­nomic re­form that our coun­try needs — of which much of the de­vel­op­ment ap­proaches be­ing ap­plied in China dove­tail some of our own sys­tems of struc­tural re­newal. There­fore, we need to be cog­nisant of the many op­tions we have in our diplo­macy bas­ket, but we must dare not for­get our past with China. If the fu­ture be­comes China; one day we must be found on the right.

Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe of­fered an ar­ray of op­por­tu­ni­ties in various sec­tors that Chi­nese com­pa­nies could in­vest in. “Zim­babwe has huge po­ten­tial and vast op­por­tu­ni­ties in all sec­tors,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. “We wel­come in­vest­ments in the en­tire min­ing value chain — from ex­plo­ration and min­ing, to value ad­di­tion, ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and mar­ket­ing. “In the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, our thrust is to mech­a­nise and mod­ernise the en­tire agro-value chain. In­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties are equally abound in the con­struc­tion of wa­ter bod­ies, ir­ri­ga­tion devel­op­ment and agri­cul­ture engi­neer­ing, the man­u­fac­tur­ing of fer­tiliser, chem­i­cals and her­bi­cides, value ad­di­tion and bene- fi­ci­a­tion of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts, agri­cul­tural fi­nanc­ing, agro-ICT so­lu­tions and other as­pects of the tech-rev­o­lu­tion that will vault our agri­cul­ture pro­duc­tiv­ity in line with global trends. “Let me as­sure you that my Gov­ern­ment will fa­cil­i­tate the im­ple­men­ta­tion of all planned ven­tures and in­vest­ments in the short­est pos­si­ble time. We look for­ward to mas­sive in­vest­ment projects by Chi­nese com­pa­nies that will see Zim­babwe on the road to ful­fill­ing its vi­sion of be­com­ing a middle-in­come coun­try with a per capita in­come of US$3 300, in­creased in­vest­ment, de­cent jobs, broad-based em­pow­er­ment, free from poverty and cor­rup­tion by 2030.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said other in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties were avail­able in the en­ergy sec­tor and wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion in­fra­struc­ture. “In­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties also abound in our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors which are in dire need of re­tool­ing and mod­erni­sa­tion. “This sec­tor has vast in­vest­ment prospects in cloth­ing and tex­tile, food processing, met­als, elec­tri­cal, leather and footwear, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, pa­per and plas­tics among others. “Over the years, our econ­omy has suf­fered from limited af­ford­able long-term fi­nanc­ing and credit lines.

He said he was im­pressed by the huge size of the Chi­nese del­e­ga­tion from Zhe­jiang province which de­scribed as the first of its kind from China since in­de­pen­dence. The Chi­nese del­e­ga­tion was led by the Gover­nor of Zhe­jiang province and sec­re­tary of the pro­vin­cial com­mit­tee of the Com­mu­nist Party of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China Mr Che Jun. Among Mr Che’s del­e­ga­tion, were busi­ness peo­ple from various sec­tors will­ing to part­ner their Zim­bab­wean coun­ter­parts to do busi­ness here. The visit was the first by Mr Che to Africa sig­nalling China’s se­ri­ous­ness to do busi­ness with Zim­babwe. Ear­lier, Mr Che and his del­e­ga­tion paid a cour­tesy call on Vice Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga at his Mun­hu­mu­tapa Office be­fore pro­ceed­ing to at­tend the Zim­babwe-China Fo­rum.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200804,"What drove Asia’s eco­nomic suc­cess sto­ries, what should Africa em­u­late?","THE re­mark­able eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion of Asia in re­cent decades has at­tracted global at­ten­tion. It has ig­nited schol­arly and pol­icy de­bates about the re­gion’s de­vel­op­ment mod­els and strate­gies. African pol­i­cy­mak­ers have not been im­mune to the world­wide fas­ci­na­tion with the “Asian mir­a­cle”. African lead­ers and of­fi­cials have these past few years un­der­taken a con­stant stream of study vis­its to coun­tries such as China, Sin­ga­pore, South Korea and Viet­nam. What lessons can African coun­tries glean from Asia’s suc­cesses and fail­ures? And how can they em­u­late those suc­cesses and avoid the mis­takes made by their Asian peers? These are the two key ques­tions the book The Asian As­pi­ra­tion – Why and How Africa Should Em­u­late Asia seeks to an­swer. Co-au­thored by Greg Mills, Oluse­gun Obasanjo, Haile­mariam De­salegn and Emily van der Merwe, the book is di­vided into two parts. The first part show­cases the “growth sto­ries” of 10 East Asian and South-East Asian coun­tries. They are Ja­pan, Tai­wan, Sin­ga­pore, South Korea, the Philip­pines, Malaysia, In­done­sia, Thai­land, China and Viet­nam. It analy­ses the de­vel­op­men­tal paths of these coun­tries, point­ing out what they did well to power their rise as well as their pol­icy mis­steps. The sec­ond sec­tion dis­cusses five lessons for suc­cess from Asia and il­lu­mi­nates these with com­par­a­tive ex­am­ples from both Asia and Africa. The book notes the dif­fer­ences be­tween Asia and Africa, and the im­por­tance of dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion. But it con­cludes by ask­ing what Lee Kuan Yew might have done had he found him­self at the helm of Africa. Lee was the for­mi­da­ble states­man who presided over the change in Sin­ga­pore’s for­tunes from 1959 to 1990. Not a mir­a­cle, but de­lib­er­ate steps The book iden­ti­fies some par­al­lels be­tween Africa and East Asia. These in­clude a colo­nial her­itage, a com­plex make-up of eth­nic groups as well as hu­man and in­sti­tu­tional un­der-de­vel­op­ment. The book also draws at­ten­tion to dif­fer­ences be­tween the two. These are rooted in how the po­lit­i­cal econ­omy of Africa evolved af­ter in­de­pen­dence. This was typ­i­fied by clien­telism, the man­age­ment of elite ac­cess and pref­er­ences in ex­change for sup­port, lead­ing to “rent-seek­ing” the cre­ation of wealth not by in­vest­ment, but by the con­nec­tions of or­gan­ised groups. In con­trast, the East Asian de­vel­op­ment tale has been de­fined by the unity of pur­pose among lead­ers in sev­eral coun­tries. It has also been char­ac­terised by the de­lib­er­ate use of in­sti­tu­tional and con­sti­tu­tional means to broaden op­por­tu­ni­ties be­yond a tiny elite. This does not sug­gest that these coun­tries were in­su­lated from or spared the ills of poor gov­er­nance. The ex­pe­ri­ences of In­done­sia and the Philip­pines, for ex­am­ple, demon­strate the bale­ful in­flu­ence of cor­rup­tion, crony­ism, frag­ile in­sti­tu­tions and pop­ulism on gov­er­nance. The authors em­pha­sise the im­por­tance of dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing be­tween and within the East Asian coun­tries, based on fac­tors such as lan­guage, re­li­gion, eco­nomic wealth, gov­er­nance sys­tems and ur­ban-rural di­vides. They ar­gue, us­ing 10 case stud­ies, that the phe­nom­e­nal changes that have taken place in East Asia are not the prod­uct of a “mir­a­cle”. They are the re­sult of cal­cu­lated pol­icy ac­tions. They iden­tify the vi­tal prin­ci­ples of lead­er­ship, the pol­icy choices and trade-offs that need to be made, and the pol­icy ex­e­cu­tion that is re­quired. The case of Ja­pan East Asian coun­tries have looked up to Ja­pan as a model of suc­cess. Ja­pan rep­re­sents the power of ex­am­ple and in­no­va­tion. The coun­try’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process was bor­rowed from a mix­ture of Amer­i­can, Bri­tish and Ger­man in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion mod­els. Ja­pan’s tech­noc­racy, led by the Min­istry of In­ter­na­tional Trade and In­dus­try (MITI), played a key part in the coun­try’s ex­tra­or­di­nary rise in the post-war pe­riod. At the heart of the coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment was strong col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween govern­ment and busi­ness, fa­cil­i­tated and guided by MITI. This govern­ment-busi­ness pro­to­type was later copied by Tai­wan and South Korea. Tai­wan’s suc­cess can be at­trib­uted to its abil­ity to mod­ernise its econ­omy through macro-eco­nomic sta­bil­ity, care­ful plan­ning and in­sti­tu­tion­al­i­sa­tion. For its part, South Korea man­aged to ac­com­plish a tran­si­tion from an agrar­ian to high-tech so­ci­ety. In both coun­tries, the busi­ness sec­tor was cen­tral to in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion ef­forts. In the case of China, the authors ac­knowl­edge the im­pres­sive strides the coun­try has made. But they ar­gue that its de­vel­op­ment ex­pe­ri­ence does not offer a flaw­less model for African gov­er­nance. This might dis­ap­point sev­eral African pol­i­cy­mak­ers who are en­am­oured with China’s de­vel­op­ment model. Sin­ga­pore’s mer­i­toc­racy Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess is ven­er­ated across Africa. The city-State used the cri­sis aris­ing from its sep­a­ra­tion from the Malaysian Fed­er­a­tion in 1965 to fo­cus re­lent­lessly on na­tional growth and de­vel­op­ment. Sin­ga­pore epit­o­mises the pin­na­cle of tech­no­cratic rule. Its suc­cess rests on ex­pert rule, fo­cus on mer­i­to­cratic tal­ent and long-range think­ing. Lead­er­ship per­for­mance is non-ne­go­tiable. As a Sin­ga­porean scholar in­ter­viewed for the book stated: The re­al­ity is that East Asian lead­ers need to per­form, even in an au­thor­i­tar­ian set­ting, as their le­git­i­macy and ten­ure is due to their suc­cess­ful growth per­for­mance, even in the ab­sence of free and fair elec­tions. Like Sin­ga­pore, South Korea had an au­thor­i­tar­ian leader in Park Chunghee. But the authors cau­tion against the fo­cus on au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism as the rea­son for these coun­tries’ rapid growth and trans­for­ma­tion. They cite other key suc­cess fac­tors, in­clud­ing a mer­i­to­cratic civil ser­vice, an adroit­ness at fus­ing the po­lit­i­cal and ex­pert com­po­nents of the gov­ern­ing sys­tem, and pol­icy prag­ma­tism. These coun­tries also place a great deal of store on hard work, dis­ci­pline, ed­u­ca­tion, in­no­va­tion, in­cen­tivi­sa­tion and growth. These ex­pe­ri­ences have been ab­sorbed and repli­cated by other coun­tries across the re­gion, Viet­nam be­ing an ex­am­ple. The book out­lines five lessons for Africa from Asia’s suc­cess. These are en­cap­su­lated un­der the head­ings: The premium of lead­er­ship and in­sti­tu­tions; Don’t be a pris­oner of the past; Get the ba­sics right for growth; Build and in­te­grate; Open up to keep con­trol. Call to ac­tion This metic­u­lously re­searched, well­writ­ten and so­lu­tion-ori­ented book is a call for ac­tion. It ex­horts African lead­ers and other ac­tors to shun parochial mind­sets and ide­o­log­i­cal dogma, and to en­act poli­cies that pri­ori­tise the col­lec­tive in­ter­ests of their na­tions. It does not con­fine it­self to pro­vid­ing a di­ag­no­sis of the prob­lems af­flict­ing Africa. It also of­fers well-con­sid­ered and tested ideas on how the con­ti­nent can over­come them. The book was pub­lished be­fore the out­break of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, which has wrought sig­nif­i­cant so­cial and eco­nomic dam­age across the world, in­clud­ing Africa. This makes its mes­sage even more rel­e­vant and ur­gent, given the press­ing need for African coun­tries to im­ple­ment in­sti­tu­tional and pol­icy re­forms to counter the ef­fects of the pan­demic. Asia has ex­tri­cated a bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty in a single gen­er­a­tion through in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able growth poli­cies. As the authors note, Africa is nei­ther a con­ti­nent of chronic hope­less­ness nor one of un­bri­dled op­ti­mism. With the right lead­er­ship, mind­set and poli­cies African coun­tries can achieve, even ex­ceed, the as­ton­ish­ing suc­cesses recorded by their Asian coun­ter­parts. They can­not du­pli­cate the Asian de­vel­op­ment path, but they can learn from their peers’ ex­pe­ri­ences, avoid their mis­takes and repli­cate their suc­cesses.  Mills Soko is a pro­fes­sor at the in­ter­na­tional busi­ness and strat­egy, Wits Busi­ness School, Univer­sity of the Wit­wa­ter­srand, South Africa",津巴布韦

Ad­dress­ing thou­sands of party sup­port­ers gath­ered at St Johns Pri­mary School in Buhera North, Amai Mu­gabe said 3 200 megawatts of elec­tric­ity would be added to the na­tional grid fol­low­ing the re­sus­ci­ta­tion of some of the gen­er­a­tors at Hwange Power Sta­tion. Zim-As­set is a devel­op­ment plan grounded on four clus­ters meant to guide the eco­nomic re­cov­ery. The four clus­ters are value-ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion, in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment and util­i­ties, food se­cu­rity and nutri­tion, and so­cial ser­vices and poverty erad­i­ca­tion. “In Hwange, some gen­er­a­tors were mal­func­tion­ing but that prob­lem has been fixed. 3 200MW are go­ing be added to the na­tional grid to ease elec­tric­ity chal­lenges,” she said. “Think­ing that our in­dus­tries can grow with­out elec­tric­ity is a chimeri­cal dream. Even po­ten­tial in­vestors would first ask if there is enough elec­tric­ity. If not, they will put on hold their in­vest­ment projects.” The First Lady said ad­dress­ing elec­tric­ity chal­lenges spurs em­ploy­ment cre­ation. Amai Mu­gabe said the food and nutri­tion clus­ter was thriv­ing. “Min­is­ter Joseph Made is busy with Com­mand Agri­cul­ture. It is a good pro­gramme that will en­sure self suf­fi­ciency when it comes to food se­cu­rity and en­sur­ing that peo­ple do not starve.” “I am sure Dr Made will run out of space to store grains de­liv­ered to the Grain Mar­ket­ing Board. He will end up ask­ing peo­ple to use their gra­naries at home.” Health in­fra­struc­ture got a boost from the China Ex­im­bank loan fa­cil­ity. Fur­ther, Buhera was given $ 8,5mil­lion for the con­struc­tion of Marowany­ati Dam. “Once fixed, the dam will ease wa­ter chal­lenges faced by vil­lagers in the dis­trict,” Amai Mu­gabe said. She said Gov­ern­ment was work­ing on the Beit­bridge-Chirundu road in or­der to speed up move­ment of goods. The First Lady also said plans were at an ad­vanced stage re­gard­ing es­tab­lish­ment of a women’s bank. “You will see how suc­cess­ful the bank is go­ing to be be­cause un­like their male coun­ter­parts, women do not have a pen­chant for hid­ing money,” she said.",津巴布韦

He added that the coun­try needed to lever­age on its key strengths. “In re­cent months, we’ve re­ceived a good num­ber of del­e­ga­tions wish­ing to in­vest in Zim­babwe. We’ve also seen Africa’s rich­est man [Aliko Dan­gote] vis­it­ing us with the in­ten­tion of es­tab­lish­ing in­vest­ments in the man­u­fac­tur­ing and power sec­tors.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20160403,Min­ing houses shed 2 500 jobs,"MIN­ING com­pa­nies, the ma­jor­ity of which are smart­ing from plum­met­ing com­mod­ity prices on in­ter­na­tional mar­kets, last year shed more than 2 500 jobs, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of work­ers that have lost their jobs in the past seven years to 13 300. The sec­tor hopes the staff cull will help min­ing houses con­tain costs and im­prove vi­a­bil­ity, es­pe­cially at a time metal prices are trekking south­wards. China, the world’s largest com­modi­ties’ con­sumer, is grap­pling with slow­ing eco­nomic growth that has ad­versely af­fected global de­mand for min­er­als. The Asia Devel­op­ment Bank fore­casts that China’s econ­omy will grow 6,5 per­cent this year and 6,3 per­cent in 2017. Sub­dued prices for base met­als like alu­minium, cop­per, lead, nickel, tin and zinc are blamed for most Zim­bab­wean min­ing job losses be­tween 2009 and 2015. The Cham­ber of Mines of Zim­babwe ex­pects cu­mu­la­tive ex­port earn­ings to drop more than US$ 50 mil­lion in 2016. And as min­ing com­pa­nies tighten purses, work­ers are likely to bear the brunt. Cham­ber of Mines CEO Mr Isaac Kwesu in­di­cated in a re­cent re­port that com­pa­nies were likely to con­tinue re­trench­ing or at least main­tain salaries at cur­rent lev­els. “Most min­ers have men­tioned vi­a­bil­ity chal­lenges, mech­a­ni­sa­tion or tran­si­tion to cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive sys­tem of pro­duc­tion as their main rea­sons for re­trench­ments. “Due to fea­si­bil­ity chal­lenges fac­ing the in­dus­try, most mines ap­pear strug­gling to pay the wages, with 12 per­cent of the re­spon­dents hav­ing ap­plied for ex­emp­tions in 2015. “All min­ing houses (100 per­cent) in­ter­viewed said that they will not af­ford any salary in­cre­ments in 2016, while 22 per­cent re­ported that they have ne­go­ti­ated and agreed salary re­duc­tions with their em­ploy­ees in 2015,” said Mr Kwesu. Most com­pa­nies be­lieve they will be able to break-even if they rein in wages, high cost of con­sum­ables, ex­pen­sive power tar­iffs and un­sus­tain­able fis­cal charges. But mine work­ers con­tinue to push for salary re­views, notwith­stand­ing a mar­ginal 1,5 per­cent hike ef­fected last month and back­dated to Jan­uary. The min­i­mum wage in the sec­tor was re­viewed from US$ 248 to US$ 251,72 per month. Work­ers say salaries are still far be­low the poverty da­tum poverty line, which stands at about US$ 500. Con­versely, em­ploy­ers are push­ing for a re­duc­tion in wages in view of the col­lapse in global min­eral prices. “De­spite the prob­lems in the min­ing sec­tor most com­pa­nies are car­ry­ing out hu­man devel­op­ment pro­grammes for their em­ploy­ees this year in a bid to im­prove to en­hance tech­ni­cal as­pect of an or­di­nary mine worker,” said Mr Kwesu. Over­all, min­eral ex­ports are forecast to re­treat from US$ 1,85 bil­lion last year to US$ 1,8 bil­lion in 2016. Though other min­er­als and met­als fore­see de­clines, gold ex­ports are ex­pected to rake in US$ 772 mil­lion this year from US$ 737 mil­lion in 2015, with out­put in­creas­ing by four tonnes from a year ear­lier to 24 tonnes.",津巴布韦

In a state­ment last week ahead of his two- day State visit to Zim­babwe, Pres­i­dent Xi said he looked for­ward to join­ing African lead­ers at the Focac Sum­mit, “and work­ing with them to ad­vance our friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion, lift China-Africa sol­i­dar­ity to a new high and build a bet­ter fu­ture for China-Africa friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Xi said con­sol­i­da­tion of re­la­tions with Zim­babwe and other African na­tions re­mained a cor­ner­stone of China’s for­eign pol­icy. “In con­duct­ing China’s re­la­tions with Africa, we ad­here to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith and up­hold the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests,” said Pres­i­dent Xi. “We will work with Zim­babwe and all other friendly African na­tions to pave a broader and more solid road of mu­tual ben­e­fit and com­mon de­vel­op­ment for China and Africa.” Pres­i­dent Xi said China val­ues the im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to the sol­i­dar­ity and de­vel­op­ment of Africa that Zim­babwe has made af­ter Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe as­sumed the chair­man­ship of the African Union. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, over the past 15 years, the trade vol­ume be­tween China and Africa has soared from $10 bil­lion to $220 bil­lion. Dur­ing the same pe­riod, China’s direct in­vest­ment in Africa has sharply in­creased from $500 mil­lion to $30 bil­lion. There are more thanr 3,000 Chi­nese com­pa­nies run­ning their busi­ness in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent World Bank re­port, since the turn of the cen­tury, sub-Sa­ha­ran re­gion has main­tained ro­bust eco­nomic growth which would oth­er­wise be im­pos­si­ble with­out its eco­nomic ties with China Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to South Africa Tian Xue­jun was re­cently quoted in the me­dia say­ing, the sum­mit will fur­ther syn­er­gise China and Africa’s re­spec­tive de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. “Cur­rently, both China and Africa are at the cru­cial stage of de­vel­op­ment and have formulated am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. China has put for­ward the two cen­te­nary goals and the Fifth Ple­nary Ses­sion of the 18th Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee has pro­posed the 13th Five-Year Pro­gramme,” he said. “The African Union has adopted Agenda 2063 and its first Ten-Year Im­ple­men­ta­tion Plan. China and Africa are mov­ing for­ward in the same di­rec­tion. Dur­ing the up­com­ing sum­mit, lead­ers of China and Africa will gather in South Africa to dis­cuss the ways to fur­ther align China and Africa’s de­vel­op­ment strate­gies and map out the new blueprint for China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion.” The Am­bas­sador said, dur­ing the sum­mit, China will an­nounce new mea­sures of co­op­er­a­tion with Africa for the next three years, “which is both a tra­di­tion and a defin­ing fea­ture of Focac.” “Th­ese new mea­sures will di­rectly serve the de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of both sides. Pri­or­i­ties will be given to ad­dress two ma­jor bot­tle­necks con­strain­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely the back­ward in­fra­struc­ture and the lack of pro­fes­sion­als,” he said. “More­over, China will fo­cus on is­sues con­cern­ing African peo­ple’s well­be­ing, like food, em­ploy­ment and health, and strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in such ma­jor ar­eas as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture build­ing, pub­lic health and poverty re­duc­tion, in­vest­ment and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, peo­pleto-peo­ple ex­changes, peace and se­cu­rity and green de­vel­op­ment.” Tian said China is the largest con­trib­u­tor of peace­keep­ers in Africa among all the per­ma­nent mem­bers of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160606,Bei­jing to push G20,"CHINA will push the Group of 20 mem­bers to do more in en­sur­ing the speedy in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of African coun­tries when they meet for their 11th sum­mit in the Asian coun­try in Septem­ber. Brief­ing Chi­nese and African jour­nal­ists on the 100-day count­down to the sum­mit last week, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Mr Wang Yi said his coun­try would push the G20 to take the lead and play an ex­em­plary role in global co­op­er­a­tion on sus­tain­able devel­op­ment. The 11th G20 sum­mit will be held in the city of Hangzhou, the cap­i­tal of Zhe­jiang province in the Yangtze River Delta, from Septem­ber 4 to 6. In prepa­ra­tion for the sum­mit, China has come up with 10 ex­pected out­comes, with the eighth be­ing on Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, which is set to be­come one of the ma­jor is­sues of fo­cus. “Eighth, ini­ti­ate co­op­er­a­tion to sup­port in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of Africa and least de­vel­oped coun­tries (LDCs) in the world,” said Mr Wang. “For Africa and LDCs, it is im­per­a­tive to speed up in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and build up ca­pac­ity for home-grown devel­op­ment. “This year, China will en­cour­age G20 mem­bers to help Africa and LDCs speed up in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, re­duce poverty and pur­sue sus­tain­able de­velop- ment by means of ca­pac­ity build­ing, in­vest­ment in­crease and in­fra­struc­ture im­prove­ment.” At the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion Sum­mit in Jo­han­nes­burg last year, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping availed $60 bil­lion to Africa, with a ma­jor chunk ear­marked for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion projects. Mr Wang said China would push for the launch of a “three-pronged anti-cor­rup­tion co­op­er­a­tion at the sum­mit”. “The sum­mit will work out the high­level prin­ci­ples on in­ter­na­tional fugi­tive repa­tri­a­tion and as­set re­cov­ery, set up a re­search cen­tre on anti-cor­rup­tion co­op­er­a­tion and make an anti-cor­rup­tion ac­tion plan (2017-2018) to guide anti-cor­rup­tion ef­forts with guid­ing prin­ci­ples and due mech­a­nisms and con­crete ac­tions, in or­der to en­sure that G20 coun­tries pro­vide no safe haven for cor­rup­tion of­fend­ers,” he said. Mr Wang said be­cause of the huge con­tri­bu­tion of G20 to the world econ­omy, it was in­deed true that the per­for­mance by its mem­ber States’ economies would have a di­rect bear­ing on the world stage. He said G20 was dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms which ap­peared favourable to a group of coun­tries. “Here, de­vel­oped coun­tries and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries sit at the same ta­ble as equal part­ners and dis­cuss and de­cide on in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic mat­ters on an equal foot­ing,” said Mr Wang. “This re­flects a ma­jor change in the world eco­nomic pat­tern and rep­re­sents his­tor­i­cal progress in keep­ing with the trend of our times.” Mr Wang said there were hopes that out­comes from the Hangzhou sum­mit would re-en­er­gise the world econ­omy, with com­mon so­lu­tions to chal­lenges and out­stand­ing is­sues ex­pected to emerge. He said China was ready to host the cru­cial sum­mit and would use the re­main­ing 100 days to wrap up preparations. “As the host, we are keenly aware of the heavy re­spon­si­bil­i­ties on our shoul­ders,” he said. “We want to fa­cil­i­tate G20’s tran­si­tion from a cri­sis-re­sponse mech­a­nism to one fo­cus­ing on longterm gov­er­nance so as to bet­ter lead world eco­nomic growth and in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion.” Other ex­pected ar­eas of fo­cus at the sum­mit will in­clude work­ing out a blue­print for in­no­va­tion-driven growth and adopt­ing an ac­tion plan for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20210326,Es­capades at the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum,"This is an ex­tended ex­cerpt from Arthur Mu­tam­bara’s up­com­ing book: In Search of the Elu­sive Zim­bab­wean Dream: Vol­ume 3: AS ex­plained in Vol­ume 2 of this se­ries of me­moirs, on 11 Jan­uary 2007, I am nom­i­nated and ac­corded the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) Young Global Leader (YGL) sta­tus. WEF is an in­de­pen­dent in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion com­mit­ted to im­prov­ing the state of the world by en­gag­ing busi­ness, po­lit­i­cal, aca­demic and other lead­ers of so­ci­ety to shape global, re­gional and in­dus­try agen­das. Founded by Pro­fes­sor Klaus Sch­wab, it is in­cor­po­rated as a not-for­profit foun­da­tion in 1971, head­quar­tered in Geneva, Switzer­land. The YGL fo­rum is a di­verse multi-stake­holder com­mu­nity of the world’s most out­stand­ing lead­ers who com­mit a por­tion of their time to jointly shap­ing a bet­ter fu­ture and thereby im­prov­ing the state of the world. It was cre­ated in 2004 by Klaus Sch­wab, the WEF founder and ex­ec­u­tive chair­per­son, as an in­de­pen­dent foun­da­tion work­ing in close part­ner­ship with the WEF. I am a WEF Young Global Leader from 2007 to 2013, and I at­tend WEF events in Europe, China, In­dia, the United States and Africa. Of im­mense im­por­tance and par­tic­u­lar sig­nif­i­cance is the An­nual Meet­ing of WEF in Davos-Klosters, Switzer­land, at the end of Jan­uary each year. At this meet­ing, global lead­ers from busi­ness, gov­ern­ment, academia and civil so­ci­ety share in­sights and dis­cuss global trends in in­ter­ac­tive work­shops and in­for­mal round­tables. Davos brings to­gether some of the world’s top pol­icy — and de­ci­sion-mak­ers in an ex­tra­or­di­nary at­mos­phere. With Bill Gates, Bill Clin­ton at Davos As Deputy Prime Min­is­ter of Zim­babwe, I at­tend WEF events in Davos ev­ery Jan­uary in the years 2009 to 2013. Pri­vate meet­ings in­clude dis­cus­sions with Prime Min­is­ters Tony Blair and David Cameron, UK For­eign Sec­re­tary David Miliband, US Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Con­doleezza Rice, Pres­i­dent Bar­rack Obama’s ad­viser Valerie Jar­rett, for­mer gover­nor of Hong Kong, Chris Pat­ten, Bill Gates and for­mer US pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton, Rwanda’s Pres­i­dent Paul Kagame, and AfDB pres­i­dent Don­ald Kaberuka. Other in­ter­est­ing in­ter­ac­tions in­volve artists Emma Thom­son, Bono, Matt Da­mon and Leonardo DiCaprio. It is the year 2010, and the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) An­nual Meet­ing is be­ing held from Jan­uary 27 to 31 in Davos, Switzer­land. As WEF Young Global Lead­ers, we have the unique op­por­tu­nity of be­ing sep­a­rately ad­dressed by Bill Gates and Bill Clin­ton. In his ad­dress, Bill Gates speaks about the Mi­crosoft story, but spends more time on his new pas­sion — global health. Dur­ing the ques­tion and an­swer ses­sion, I ask him about his own story: “Bill, I un­der­stand you dropped out of Har­vard in your sec­ond year of study­ing Physics. How did you man­age the risks in­volved? If it were me in your sit­u­a­tion, the en­tire vil­lage would stone me, say­ing: “Arthur you have an op­por­tu­nity to go to Ox­ford Univer­sity, but drop out. How dare you?”’ Bill laughs and says: “I did not take that much of a risk. I spoke to my pro­fes­sors at Har­vard, and they en­cour­aged me. They said: ‘Pur­sue your dreams. Go and form your com­pany and blos­som. How­ever, if you run into dif­fi­cul­ties and things do not work out, come back to Har­vard and we will help you con­tinue with your stud­ies and earn your de­gree.’ You see, it was not as risky as you think!’ I am to­tally but pleas­antly as­ton­ished. This is how it should be. The ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem must mit­i­gate and min­imise the risks that bright stu­dents take as they pur­sue their dreams and be­come en­trepreneurs. This is part of the ge­nius of the US aca­demic sys­tem, which is based on cred­its, which one can com­plete in their own time frame. I con­trast this with the English sys­tem, such as we have in Zim­babwe, where you are with­drawn or dis­con­tin­ued from the aca­demic pro­gramme if you drop out or fail. Only in rare cases does one get a sup­ple­men­tary ex­am­i­na­tion or is al­lowed to re­peat a class. The flex­i­ble US aca­demic sys­tem puts a premium on en­trepreneur­ship and job cre­ation, whereas the English one is about cre­at­ing work­ers. The ques­tions by stu­dents within the Bri­tish sys­tem are: “Pro­fes­sor, how do I get a first class? How do I grad­u­ate top of the class? How do I qual­ify for a Mas­ter’s or PhD pro­gramme?” In the US, the ques­tions are: “Pro­fes­sor, how do I get a patent for my work? How do I com­mer­cialise my the­sis or dis­ser­ta­tion and form a com­pany?” In the US, ed­u­ca­tion is a means to an end, not an end in it­self. If the end can be achieved with­out a de­gree, pur­suit of the qual­i­fi­ca­tion can be set aside. Great en­trepreneurs such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zucker­burg are typ­i­cal ex­am­ples of this US at­ti­tude and dis­po­si­tion to­wards for­mal ed­u­ca­tion. With Bill Clin­ton, we are sur­prised at the way he is still sharp and well-versed with cur­rent pub­lic pol­icy is­sues in the US and glob­ally. He has got it all at his fin­ger­tips. Bill Clin­ton presents a de­tailed anal­y­sis of con­tem­po­rary po­lit­i­cal de­bates in the US and deals with global chal­lenges such as cli­mate change, HIV/Aids, poverty and nu­clear weapons. He is at his best. He also en­cour­ages us as young peo­ple to take up pub­lic ser­vice. He also em­pha­sises the im­por­tance of ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion, not just or­a­tor­i­cal skills, but me­dia strat­egy, story-telling and cre­ative use of mod­ern tech­nol­ogy. He sug­gests that he is not an out­stand­ing or­a­tor but an ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tor. Dur­ing dis­cus­sions, I ask him: “If you had got­ten into pol­i­tics a lit­tle older, would you have been a bet­ter pres­i­dent? Also, what are your ma­jor re­grets? What would you do dif­fer­ently?” He does not an­swer these ques­tions well. I am quite sur­prised that the usu­ally ar­tic­u­late Bill Clin­ton pre­var­i­cates and ap­pears de­fen­sive. He seems cau­tious of any­thing that might force him to talk about the Mon­ica Lewin­sky saga. Any­way, I let the mat­ter rest with­out fur­ther prob­ing. I let it slide. As fel­low Rhodes Schol­ars, af­ter the main meet­ing, he and I have a lit­tle chat about Ox­ford and life af­ter that great in­sti­tu­tion. Later that evening Jackie (my wife) and I meet up again with Bill Clin­ton at one of the WEF so­cial events. They have quite a chat as Jackie re­minds him of how they had met at the Hay Fes­ti­val of Lit­er­a­ture and Arts held at Hayon-Wye in the United King­dom in 2001. Of course, we have some beau­ti­ful pic­tures taken with the for­mer US Pres­i­dent. — the V11 forms (the evidence) in Zim­bab­wean lin­gua! As WEF Young Global Lead­ers meet­ing and dis­cussing with Bill Gates and Bill Clin­ton are some of the highlights of our WEF Davos ex­pe­ri­ence in Jan­uary 2010. GNU Prin­ci­pals at WEF In ad­di­tion to the an­nual WEF Davos meet­ing, there is also the WEF on Africa, which takes place over three days. Like Davos, it is renowned for its in­for­mal style, which aims to en­gen­der frank, open and de­tailed con­ver­sa­tions among the most in­flu­en­tial lead­ers — po­lit­i­cal, busi­ness, civil so­ci­ety and aca­demic — with a stake in the African con­ti­nent. As WEF Young Global Lead­ers, some of us have the unique op­por­tu­nity of at­tend­ing both the WEF Davos and Africa meet­ings. In 2010, Tan­za­nia hosts the WEF on Africa in Dar es Salaam from May 5 to 7. This is the 20th an­niver­sary of the WEF on Africa. It is also the first time that the Fo­rum’s Africa meet­ing is held in east Africa, away from its tra­di­tional African venue of Cape Town. With South Africa host­ing the World Cup in June 2010, it is de­cided to move WEF on Africa away from the hec­tic prepa­ra­tions for the World Cup to Dar es Salaam. The coun­try’s pres­i­dent, Jakaya Kik­wete, wel­comes the news, say­ing: “It is heart­en­ing to see the pos­i­tive im­pact that the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum has on key is­sues of global con­cern. The theme of this year’s gath­er­ing is Re­think­ing Africa’s Growth Strat­egy.” The ses­sion on Zim­babwe is un­der the topic: The Fu­ture of Zim­babwe. It fea­tures pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe, prime min­is­ter Ts­van­gi­rai and my­self. Also present are African Sun’s Shin­gai Mun­yeza, Old Mu­tual’s Kuseni Dlamini, TV host Julie Gichuru, and Runa Alam of De­vel­op­ment Part­ners In­ter­na­tional. We dis­cuss Zim­babwe’s fu­ture, the re­forms be­ing un­der­taken, how busi­nesses and in­vestors were ad­just­ing their op­er­a­tional strate­gies to the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ments. Sanc­tions, in­di­geni­sa­tion, in­vest­ment drive, and a shared vi­sion were also dis­cussed. Wait a minute, I have gone ahead of my­self! The ses­sion on Zim­babwe is not part of the WEF agenda. The un­sched­uled never hap­pened panel that al­most The his­toric panel dis­cus­sion in Tan­za­nia by the three Zim­babwe Gov­ern­ment of Na­tional Unity (GNU) prin­ci­pals hosted by Sch­wab, is not on the WEF pro­gramme. This unique and un­prece­dented global plat­form is a prod­uct of last-minute ef­forts. It al­most does not hap­pen! As a WEF Young Global Leader, at one of our ses­sions, Klaus ap­proaches me and says, “Arthur, you are here at WEF. The prime min­is­ter, Morgan Ts­van­gi­rai, is also at­tend­ing WEF. I un­der­stand pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe is in Dar es Salaam for a sep­a­rate meet­ing of lib­er­a­tion move­ments. Why can’t we get the three of you — the GNU prin­ci­pals — to share a panel at WEF?” The po­ten­tial sig­nif­i­cance of such a shared fo­rum strikes me. I say to Klaus: “Give me 30 min­utes.” I dash off to con­sult Ts­van­gi­rai, the prime min­is­ter. While he agrees to par­tic­i­pate, he is scep­ti­cal about whether I can con­vince Mu­gabe. Off I rush to the pres­i­dent’s ho­tel room. His usual clumsy hang­ers-on and shame­less bootlick­ers — in­clud­ing Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa (Pres­i­dent), Ge­orge Charamba, Sim­barashe Mum­bengegwi and Mun­yaradzi Ka­jese — are in his room when my mes­sage gets to him, re­quest­ing to meet him and dis­cuss the po­ten­tial WEF panel dis­cus­sion. To a man, they all vi­ciously ar­gue against the idea. They dis­cour­age Mu­gabe from par­tic­i­pat­ing. “It is a set-up for hu­mil­i­a­tion”, they pon­tif­i­cate. The ever cun­ning, as­tute and Machi­avel­lian Mu­gabe asks all of them to leave the room. He de­cides to dis­cuss the mat­ter with me only. As I walk into his ho­tel room, the crafty po­lit­i­cal gla­di­a­tor gra­ciously wel­comes me. With a wily smile, he gets down to busi­ness: “Pro­fes­sor Mu­tam­bara, what is the state of play? What is go­ing on?” I ex­plain to him the value and sig­nif­i­cance of the event to the coun­try — show­cas­ing the GNU out­side Zim­babwe by its three prin­ci­pals to a global au­di­ence of busi­ness, po­lit­i­cal and civil so­ci­ety lead­ers. “This is an un­prece­dented op­por­tu­nity, Mr Pres­i­dent.” I ef­fec­tively ar­tic­u­late and present an im­pen­e­tra­ble case. He asks a few clar­i­fi­ca­tion ques­tions and agrees to par­tic­i­pate. “Let us do it, pro­fes­sor. I am in. Go and brief Klaus, ac­cord­ingly. Good show (his favourite phrase af­ter ev­ery meet­ing)!” Mu­gabe has just taken my ad­vice over the views of his un­so­phis­ti­cated, thought­less and fawn­ing cheer­lead­ers — the bungling and in­ept lot! As I leave Mu­gabe’s ho­tel room and close the door be­hind me, I am be­sieged by cu­ri­ous and ner­vous bootlick­ers who are milling around out­side Mu­gabe’s room. All the usual sus­pects are there. I con­fi­dently de­clare: “The Pres­i­dent has agreed to par­tic­i­pate. The Zim­babwe ses­sion is on!” Mnan­gagwa and Ge­orge Charamba al­most col­lapse and faint. They are apoplec­tic with fear and despondency. Charamba will later write in the Zim­babwe Her­ald news­pa­per that “Arthur Mu­tam­bara was ei­ther fool­hardy or a ge­nius to pro­pose such a suc­cess­ful plat­form to pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe!” Umm re­ally? What stark choices! Am I al­lowed to se­lect be­tween the two ra­tio­nales, or it is for oth­ers to de­ter­mine? Quite com­i­cal, in­deed. Well, the WEF plat­form on Zim­babwe is a roar­ing suc­cess. Again, I am go­ing ahead of my­self. Let us step back for a minute. With com­mit­ments from both the Prime Min­is­ter and the Pres­i­dent, I rush back to Klaus. I ex­cit­edly an­nounce to him, “We are on! My two col­leagues, the prime min­is­ter and the pres­i­dent have agreed.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190721,Ac­tive en­gage­ment key to un­lock­ing value in Fo­cac,"THE an­nounce­ment by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in Septem­ber 2018 of an­other three-year US$60 bil­lion Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Fo­cac) pack­age for Africa — which matches a sim­i­lar of­fer in 2015 — set off an­other flurry of analy­ses and pre­dic­tions. The key ques­tion asked is: what does China want from Africa? An­swers from most who venture their opin­ion are mixed with phrases like dump­ing ground, neo-colo­nial­ism and ex­ploita tion fea­tur­ing fre­quently. Zim­babwe, like most of Africa, is used to a West­ern pa­tron­age sys­tem, whereby aid money and trade con­ces­sions are doled out within a rigid guide­line frame­work. There is a car­rot-and-stick ap­proach in which African na­tions re­ceive a set of dos and don’ts and are re­warded for com­pli­ance or pun­ished for fail­ing to sing from the hymn book. Most Zim­bab­weans by now un­der­stand the capri­cious nature of sanc­tions, which are ar­bi­trar­ily im­posed on some na­tions for al­leged crimes, while oth­ers — with worse track records — are not placed un­der the same em­bar­goes. There­fore, it is not sur­pris­ing that a seem­ingly no-strings-at­tached of­fer for fi­nan­cial devel­op­ment from China sounds too good to be true. There must be a hid­den mo­tive, the con­clu­sion is reached. In Zim­babwe, gen­eral public opin­ion of the friend­ship be­tween Harare and Bei­jing re­flects that broader per­spec­tive. At a time when the or­di­nary per­son on the street is fac­ing stiff eco­nomic chal­lenges, it is for­give­able for peo­ple to ask just what it is that the friend­ship with China has brought to Zim­babwe. I will start off by an­swer­ing that ques­tion in a sim­plis­tic man­ner by list­ing some tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits of Sino-Zim friend­ship for or­di­nary peo­ple over the past decade be­low: ♦ Ed­u­ca­tion: Zim­babwe-China Friend­ship High School in Ep­worth built at a cost of US$2 mil­lion is just one of sev­eral schools that China has built in Zim­babwe over the past five years. Hun­dreds of Zim­bab­wean stu­dents have re­ceived full schol­ar­ships to study in China. ♦ Health: China has built sev­eral health in­sti­tu­tions, including the US$6 mil­lion China-Zim­babwe Friend­ship Hos­pi­tal in Mahusekwa ♦ Aid: China do­nated 19 000 tonnes of rice worth US$24,6 mil­lion dur­ing the 2016 drought pe­riod and stepped in with as­sis­tance for those af­fected by Tugwi -Mukosi flood­ing, as well as in the af­ter­math of Cy­clone Idai. ♦ Power: Kariba South Hy­dro Sta­tion worth US$533 mil­lion, which added a crucial 300 megawatts to the na­tional grid. Cur­rent acute power short­ages are be­cause that en­hanced ca­pac­ity has been nul­li­fied by low water lev­els at Kariba Dam. There is no doubt that China has been a good friend to Zim­babwe. This same story can be told in dif­fer­ent set­tings in Africa. But that is not enough to dis­miss the gen­uine con­cerns raised by those wary of the as­so­ci­a­tion. In any good friend­ship, hon­esty, ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency are key pil­lars. Which is where as Zim­bab­weans, and in­deed Africans, we need to step for­ward and ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in Fo­cac dis­cus­sions. Sim­ply be­cause this is some­thing that we can­not ig­nore. Even the US is now turn­ing to China for fi­nan­cial bailouts, so love or hate it, you can­not ig­nore China. There­fore, we must en­gage. It is up to us to un­lock value in Fo­cac by un­pack­ing what is on the ta­ble and adding our in­formed input to cre­ate the out­comes that we de­sire. China is not go­ing to do that for Zim­babwe or any other African coun­try. We must stop trans­fer­ring the onus of that re­spon­si­bil­ity. It is ours as in­di­vid­ual African na­tions and as a col­lec­tive con­ti­nent. We should not treat Fo­cac as a Christ­mas Bo­nanza, which makes it pos­si­ble to har­vest free give-aways. Nor should we treat it like an in­vi­ta­tion to a haunted house. We must roll up our sleeves and get in­volved. China has made it clear how the US$60 bil­lion Fo­cac kitty will be spent. US$15 bil­lion is for aid, in­ter­est-free loans and con­ces­sional loans, US$20 bil­lion for credit lines, US$10 bil­lion is set for spe­cial fund for China-Africa devel­op­ment, and there is US$5 bil­lion for im­ports from Africa. An­other US$10 bil­lion is from Chi­nese busi­nesses. Zim­bab­wean busi­nesses need a clear strat­egy on how to ac­cess op­por­tu­ni­ties for credit lines, ex­ports to China and part­ner­ships with Chi­nese busi­nesses. That is a to­tal of US$35 bil­lion in the off­ing. Zim­babwe has a fair chance of ac­cess­ing a rea­son­able share of that pie. But it will not rain on us like manna from heaven, sav­ing starv­ing trav­ellers in the desert. There is need for lo­calised Fo­cac strategic plan­ning for im­ple­men­ta­tion. It is up to lo­cal busi­nesses to spell Zim­babwe’s vi­sion in Fo­cac and then pro­duce an ac­tion plan to make it real. In­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions such as the World Bank have taken note of China’s dream. They have pro­duced reams of analy­ses. Yet as one of the coun­tries en­gag­ing with China, Zim­babwe and most African sis­ter coun­tries has very low en­gage­ment. Where are Fo­cac breakfast meet­ings? Where are busi­ness-to-busi­ness Fo­cac en­gage­ment initiatives? Where are Fo­cac na­tional-level in­for­ma­tion cen­tres? Where are Fo­cac thought lead­er­ship ex­perts? Where are our doc­u­men­ta­tion cen­tres? Where are lo­calised ex­pert analy­ses teach­ing us of pit­falls from our own his­tory or that of fel­low African coun­tries and how they can be avoided in fu­ture? Where are initiatives for re­gional or con­ti­nen­tal in­dus­try in­te­gra­tion so that part­ner­ships with African busi­nesses make sense for colossal Chi­nese con­glom­er­ates, while giv­ing African coun­tries a more eq­ui­table stake? We have none be­cause few peo­ple have both­ered to delve into the ini­tia­tive to un­der­stand the op­por­tu­ni­ties and pit­falls. As long as we take the at­ti­tude that Fo­cac is solely a gov­ern­ment-to-gov­ern­ment pro­gramme, there will be no tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits for our econ­omy. China has es­tab­lished in­sti­tu­tions to pro­vide think-tank ser­vices for Fo­cac initiatives. One of these is China-Africa In­sti­tute in­au­gu­rated in April 2019. A part of the Chi­nese Academy of So­cial Sciences, the in­sti­tute is fo­cused on Fo­cac peo­ple-to-peo­ple initiatives, pro­vid­ing a closer cul­tural and so­cial link be­tween Chi­nese ci­ti­zens and their coun­ter­parts from dif­fer­ent African coun­tries un­der the peo­ple-to-peo­ple pil­lar of Fo­cac. The in­sti­tute re­cently hosted schol­ars from African coun­tries to ex­plore ar­eas of mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion in aca­demic re­search into var­i­ous ar­eas, with em­pha­sis on poverty re­duc­tion and cul­tural ex­changes. The del­e­ga­tion of 12 schol­ars from Botswana, Namibia, Nige­ria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tan­za­nia, Uganda, Zam­bia and Zim­babwe met with lead­ers of sev­eral Chi­nese aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions and gov­ern­ment de­part­ments to un­der­stand China’s stance on Sino-Africa re­la­tions. Zim­babwe, and in­deed Africa, needs to chan­nel sim­i­lar en­ergy and ded­i­ca­tion to Fo­cac, if we are to gain any­thing from this ini­tia­tive. It is only through proper due dili­gence that we can pro­duce bank­able pro­pos­als that safe­guard our in­ter­ests. We must take agency and not sit back and ex­pect China to hand us eco­nomic sal­va­tion on a plat­ter.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180823,Why Africa must in­dus­tri­alise,"EX­TREME poverty, the most wide­spread and de­struc­tive char­ac­ter­is­tic of un­der­de­vel­op­ment, is per­va­sive and tena­cious in Africa. To im­prove liveli­hoods, labour needs to be moved rapidly into more pro­duc­tive sec­tors, in par­tic­u­lar man­u­fac­tur­ing. Only then - given its large and fast-grow­ing pop­u­la­tion - will the con­ti­nent be able to grow fast enough to ef­fec­tively al­le­vi­ate poverty. A re­cent In­sti­tute for Se­cu­rity Stud­ies re­port dis­cusses and mod­els the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of the Fourth In­dus­trial Revo­lu­tion in Africa, with a time hori­zon to 2040. It shows how - from 1994 un­til 2008 - (when the global re­ces­sion hit) Africa ex­pe­ri­enced its most sus­tained pe­riod of growth since in­de­pen­dence in the 1960s - an av­er­age of 4,6 per­cent per an­num. Although the av­er­age per capita in­come in­creased by more than a third dur­ing this pe­riod, Africa’s poverty rate de­creased by only about five per­cent­age points, in part due to the con­ti­nent’s high lev­els of in­equal­ity. Man­u­fac­tur­ing in Africa is six times more pro­duc­tive than agriculture In 1994, av­er­age in­come lev­els in Africa were 36 per­cent of the global av­er­age (US$3 487 com­pared to US$9 795 us­ing con­stant 2017 dol­lars). In 2017, it was only around 31 per­cent. So things are get­ting bet­ter in Africa, but slower than the global av­er­age. The his­tor­i­cal trend de­picted in the graph above in­cludes a fore­cast for 2020 and 2030. It is cal­cu­lated us­ing the In­ter­na­tional Fu­tures fore­cast­ing sys­tem hosted at the Univer­sity of Den­ver. It pre­dicts that Africa will, on av­er­age, ex­pe­ri­ence an­nual growth of 4,8 per­cent from 2018 to 2030 com­pared to global growth of 3,2 per­cent. Be­cause Africa has much higher pop­u­la­tion growth rates than the global av­er­age, the gap be­tween av­er­age in­come lev­els in Africa and the world con­tin­ues to grow, although more slowly than be­fore. The im­pact of Africa’s growth spurt from 1994 to 2008 is ev­i­dent in that by 2010, Africa’s av­er­age in­come lev­els had im­proved to 34 per­cent of the global av­er­age (com­pared to 33 per­cent in 2000) be­fore re­sum­ing its down­ward tra­jec­tory. What would change this rather dis­mal fore­cast? The growth of the two decades be­fore 2010 was largely due to high ex­port vol­umes needed to feed Asia’s man­u­fac­tur­ing and con­struc­tion boom. Africa gen­er­ally grew be­cause of the com­modi­ties su­per­cy­cle that started in 1996, peaked in 2011 and has been in a down­swing since. In fact, Africa is in­creas­ingly de­pen­dent on trade in com­modi­ties. The United Nations Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment’s most re­cent State of Com­mod­ity De­pen­dence Re­port noted that 46 out of 55 African coun­tries are now de­pen­dent on com­mod­ity ex­ports. Whereas com­mod­ity de­pen­dence else­where is largely static, it is in­creas­ing in Africa. On cur­rent fore­casts, Africa’s de­vel­op­men­tal fu­ture will largely de­pend on the start of a next com­modi­ties su­per­cy­cle. If the length of pre­vi­ous cy­cles are an in­di­ca­tion, that should be­gin in around 2028. This time it will be In­dia’s steadily grow­ing econ­omy that will drive the de­mand for re­sources from Africa as China did pre­vi­ously. Growth in man­u­fac­tur­ing in­creases wages and pro­duc­tiv­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor But there are risks in­volved with com­mod­ity de­pen­dence - in­clud­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity to ex­treme global price swings, most ev­i­dent in the price of oil. Com­modi­ties pro­vide a step­ping stone, but only if coun­tries use that in­come for the struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion of their economies - by moving cap­i­tal, labour and tech­nol­ogy from lower to higher pro­duc­tiv­ity sec­tors. The Asian ex­pe­ri­ence shows that man­u­fac­tur­ing is the most pro­duc­tive sec­tor. In Asia, growth-in­duc­ing struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion from low-pro­duc­tiv­ity sub­sis­tence agriculture to higher-pro­duc­tiv­ity man­u­fac­tur­ing led to rapid in­come growth. It also re­sulted in un­prece­dented lev­els of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and im­proved liveli­hoods. Rapid trans­for­ma­tion of its agri­cul­tural sec­tor also helped Asia re­duce poverty. Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa has not fol­lowed this tra­jec­tory. Struc­tural change has started, but much more is needed. In Africa, the shift is gen­er­ally from low-pro­duc­tiv­ity agriculture to marginally more pro­duc­tive em­ploy­ment in ser­vices, gen­er­ally con­sist­ing of whole­sale and re­tail trade in the in­for­mal sec­tor. De­lib­er­ate poli­cies and de­ter­mined na­tional ef­fort are needed for Africa to in­dus­tri­alise A United Nations Univer­sity World In­sti­tute for De­vel­op­ment Eco­nom­ics Re­search study con­firms that man­u­fac­tur­ing in Africa is six times more pro­duc­tive than agriculture. It also says man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­pels more rapid gen­eral eco­nomic pro­duc­tiv­ity im­prove­ments. Low-end ser­vices such as re­tail and trade were by 2010 only twice more pro­duc­tive than agriculture, with the re­sult that growth in ser­vices in Africa has con­trib­uted to no or slow growth in ag­gre­gate per capita in­come. Rather than im­prov­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity, Africa’s struc­tural trans­for­ma­tion from very low-pro­duc­tiv­ity agriculture to low-pro­duc­tiv­ity ur­ban-based re­tail ser­vices has been “growth re­duc­ing”. This is be­cause the share of work­ers em­ployed in high-pro­duc­tiv­ity sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing is de­clin­ing, off­set­ting pos­i­tive “within sec­tor” pro­duc­tiv­ity growth. The re­sult is that the ag­gre­gate growth of out­put per worker is de­clin­ing. Or­gan­i­sa­tions as di­verse as the World Bank, the African Union and the African De­vel­op­ment Bank have long ar­gued that it is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant to un­lock the agri­cul­tural po­ten­tial of Africa to ad­dress poverty, high lev­els of food in­se­cu­rity, hunger and mal­nour­ish­ment. But be­yond ba­sic sub­sis­tence-level agriculture, in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion de­ter­mines agri­cul­tural ex­pan­sion and ef­fi­ciency, as well as the de­vel­op­ment of high-value ser­vices. The knowl­edge spill-over from man­u­fac­tur­ing even­tu­ally makes it prof­itable to in­vest in more pro­duc­tive agri­cul­tural ma­chin­ery and sys­tems. Growth in man­u­fac­tur­ing thereby in­creases wages and pro­duc­tiv­ity in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. But in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion doesn’t hap­pen on its own. De­lib­er­ate poli­cies and a de­ter­mined na­tional ef­fort are needed in each coun­try to make it work. Only then will Africa have the po­ten­tial to em­u­late the Asian ex­pe­ri­ence in re­duc­ing poverty. - In­sti­tute of Se­cu­rity Stud­ies ◆ Jakkie Cil­liers is the head of African Fu­tures and In­no­va­tion, ISS",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20201108,Why African lead­ers now smell like goats,"IT has come full cir­cle for Evo Mo­rales. The for­mer president of the South Amer­i­can coun­try of Bo­livia will be re­turn­ing home on Wed­nes­day this week (Novem­ber 11, 2020) — ex­actly 12 months to the day af­ter his Novem­ber 11, 2019 es­cape from the coun­try af­ter he was hounded for “rig­ging the elec­tion” in a “heav­ily flawed” Oc­to­ber 2019 vote that was sup­posed to give him his fourth term in of­fice. You see, the dra­matic events that led to Mo­rales’ ouster be­gan on Fri­day Oc­to­ber 25 last year when that coun­try’s elec­tion tri­bunal de­clared him the win­ner, which riled his main ri­val Car­los Mesa who, as has be­come the norm with op­po­si­tion par­ties con­test­ing elec­tions nowa­days, even in Amer­ica (Kikikiki), called the whole ex­er­cise a “gi­gan­tic fraud”. Rolling protests fol­lowed and quickly snow­balled. Sub­se­quently, the United States-based Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Amer­i­can States (OAS) — a re­gional body bring­ing to­gether the 35 sup­pos­edly in­de­pen­dent states of the Amer­i­cas — pur­port­edly au­dited the vote and is­sued a pre­lim­i­nary re­port on Novem­ber 10 claim­ing it had dis­cov­ered “in­con­tro­vert­ible ev­i­dence of an elec­toral process marred by grave ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties”. On the same day, the US Sec­re­tary of State, Mike Pom­peo, tweeted: “Fully sup­port the find­ings of the @OAS_of­fi­cial re­port rec­om­mend­ing new elec­tions in #Bo­livia to en­sure a truly demo­cratic process rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the peo­ple’s will. The cred­i­bil­ity of the elec­toral sys­tem must be re­stored.” It sup­plied the much-needed fod­der for the op­po­si­tion. In fact, the Washington DC-head­quar­tered or­gan­i­sa­tion ef­fec­tively put its fin­ger on the scale and tipped it against Mo­rales, who was de­scribed as a “wannabe dic­ta­tor”. All the while, the left-lean­ing Ay­maran In­dian politi­cian, who first came to power in 2006 as Bo­livia’s first in­dige­nous President, was com­ing un­der with­er­ing at­tacks from the US ad­min­is­tra­tion, its vested and abid­ing press and other re­gional coun­tries that were press­ing for a fresh elec­tion. Although he tried to hold his ground, he fi­nally gave in af­ter the com­pro­mised se­cu­rity forces asked him to re­sign. On Novem­ber 11 he was gone. But why is the story of Evo Mo­rales even im­por­tant or rel­e­vant in this part of the world? Well, Bishop Lazi wants you to ap­pre­ci­ate how this South Amer­i­can chap was even­tu­ally felled by a dev­as­tat­ing and toxic tri­fecta of an os­ten­si­bly damn­ing OAS au­dit re­port, fes­ter­ing post-elec­tion protests de­mand­ing a fresh vote and telling pres­sure from some sec­tions of the se­cu­rity forces. We are told that his sins are far too fa­mil­iar on the African con­ti­nent. As then-Latin Amer­ica’s long­est-serv­ing leader, we are told he tried, “as many African lead­ers are wont to do”, to “cling on” to power by ex­tend­ing his rule be­yond his term limit through “rig­ging” and “fraud”. Af­ter Mo­rales’ 2014 elec­toral land­slide vic­tory, the US-based New York Times — be­lieved to be one of the three Amer­i­can pro-western coup news­pa­pers, in­clud­ing The Econ­o­mist and the Washington Post — had eerily warned that “the pat­tern of pro­longed terms in power is un­healthy for the re­gion”. All the deroga­tory nomen­cla­ture that we have been hear­ing to de­scribe re­cent elec­tions in Africa, par­tic­u­larly in Guinea, Ivory Coast and Tan­za­nia, and more re­cently the im­pend­ing elec­tions in Uganda, was sim­i­larly sys­tem­at­i­cally wheeled out. Not sur­pris­ingly, Mo­rales was de­scribed as a “mean-spir­ited au­to­cratic dic­ta­tor” who could stop at noth­ing, even tram­pling on the “will of the elec­torate” just to “re­main in power”. The white man says give a dog a bad name and hang him, while our fore­fa­thers told us that when a hyena wants to eat its cubs, it first ac­cuses them of smelling like goats. Jour­nal­ist, con­sti­tu­tional lawyer and author, Glenn Green­wald, who is one of the co-founders of The In­ter­cept, an on­line pub­li­ca­tion, wrote on June 8, 2020 that: “The (New York) Times sim­i­larly lamented the dan­gers posed to Bo­li­vian democ­racy back in 2014 as the re­sult of Mo­rales’ land­slide vic­tory at the polls. To the Times and the US me­dia at large, democ­racy is im­per­illed when a can­di­date dis­liked by the US wins at the polls; con­versely, democ­racy can be saved only when such elected lead­ers are over­thrown and re­placed by force with a US-backed pup­pet.” Red­flags But this is where it gets in­ter­est­ing: The same New York Times re­ported on June 7 this year that a study that had been con­ducted by three ex­perts from US uni­ver­si­ties — Fran­cisco Ro­dríguez, an econ­o­mist who teaches Latin Amer­i­can stud­ies at Tu­lane Uni­ver­sity; Dorothy Kron­ick, an ex­pert on Latin Amer­i­can pol­i­tics at the Uni­ver­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia, and Ni­colás Idrobo, a doc­toral stu­dent at the same uni­ver­sity who is the co-author of a text­book on ad­vanced sta­tis­ti­cal meth­ods — had shown that it was ac­tu­ally the OAS au­dit find­ings, and not the Bo­li­vian elec­tion re­sults, that were a fraud. “A close look at Bo­li­vian elec­tion data sug­gests an ini­tial anal­y­sis by the OAS that raised ques­tions of vote-rig­ging — and helped force out a president — was flawed,” the ex­perts con­cluded. These find­ings were also cor­rob­o­rated by the Washington-based eco­nomic think-tank, Cen­tre for Eco­nomic and Pol­icy Re­search, which re­leased an 82-page re­port on the OAS au­dit in March this year. It claimed: “The OAS’ ob­ser­va­tion ac­tiv­i­ties in Bo­livia’s 2019 gen­eral elec­tions are the lat­est ex­am­ple of a deeply prob­lem­atic ob­ser­va­tion mis­sion whose dis­hon­est, bi­ased, and un­pro­fes­sional con­duct has caused se­ri­ous dam­age to the coun­try’s democ­racy.” But the OAS, just like many other in­ter­na­tional or­gans that are prox­ies of the US, has for long been con­sid­ered in Latin Amer­ica as a servile and sub­servient tool of the US State Depart­ment. All this, how­ever, came af­ter the fact, and we now know that it is true. Why? Af­ter the fresh vote that was sub­se­quently con­ducted last month, Bo­livia’s elec­tions tri­bunal again de­clared that Mo­rales’ party, Move­ment for So­cial­ism (MAS), now led by Luis Arce, had tri­umphed over a united op­po­si­tion — again now a com­mon trend in Africa — un­der the ban­ner of Car­los Mesa, who had been de­feated by the ousted leader last year. So, how could a thor­oughly un­pop­u­lar party that was ac­cused of try­ing to rig last year’s elec­tion win this year’s polls? Proverbs 28: 1-28 says: “The wicked flee when no one pur­sues, but the right­eous are bold as a lion. When a land trans­gresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of un­der­stand­ing and knowl­edge, its sta­bil­ity will long con­tinue. A poor man who op­presses the poor is a beat­ing rain that leaves no food. Those who for­sake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them. Evil men do not un­der­stand jus­tice, but those who seek the Lord un­der­stand it com­pletely. . .” Evil men in­deed do not un­der­stand jus­tice. Back on the menu Bishop Lazi again asks: Why this ker­fuf­fle or fuss over Bo­livia? In an in­ter­view in ex­ile with The In­ter­cept’s Glenn Green­wald soon af­ter his ouster, Mo­rales gave a very re­veal­ing in­sight of how he found him­self in his un­en­vi­able cir­cum­stances. “When I be­came President in 2006 and 2007, a brother . . . told me, ‘President Evo, watch out for the United States Em­bassy.’ And I asked him, ‘why?’ Be­cause where there are US em­bassies, there are coups, ex­cept for the United States be­cause there are no US em­bassies in the US. So why did we throw out the US Am­bas­sador (in 2008)? He was con­spir­ing, he was plan­ning coups. In my 13 years in of­fice I do not know how many coups we de­feated, but this time we were de­feated.” Well, quite omi­nously, in 2008, Mo­rales had ex­pelled US Am­bas­sador Philip Gold­berg for ac­tively pro­mot­ing protests and try­ing to en­gi­neer regime change. Sounds fa­mil­iar? Kikikiki. The whole fuss is about try­ing to con­trol key re­sources. Es­sen­tially, the OAS re­port wanted to shift power of lithium-rich Bo­livia to the white, US-sub­servient right led by Car­los Mesa. Bo­livia has the world’s largest lithium re­sources — a light metal that is crit­i­cal in high-per­for­mance bat­ter­ies used in smart­phones, lap­tops, elec­tric cars and re­new­able power stor­age fa­cil­i­ties. It is cur­rently at the cen­tre of the world’s green rev­o­lu­tion. Stud­ies that have been ver­i­fied by the US Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey in­di­cated that Bo­livia has 21 mil­lion tonnes of lithium, which is three times as much as in Aus­tralia, the world’s largest pro­ducer. Mo­rales wanted to build a state-run lithium in­dus­try that would give it the where­withal to lift its pop­u­la­tion out of poverty. It was quite promis­ing be­cause the one­time co­coa farmer had man­aged to lift many Bo­li­vians out of poverty and tremen­dously raised the stan­dard of liv­ing dur­ing his ten­ure. Un­der Mo­rales, a left wing politi­cian averse and sus­pi­cious of the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund and the World Bank that he re­garded as in­stru­ments of the West’s ne­olib­eral global in­flu­ence, Bo­livia’s econ­omy grew by a steady 5 per­cent a year. Poverty fell from 60 per­cent in 2006 to 35 per­cent in 2017. Ex­treme poverty more than halved from 38 per­cent to 15 per­cent. The coun­try’s un­em­ploy­ment also halved, while the min­i­mum wage in­creased three­fold. Mo­rales’ achieve­ments were stag­ger­ing. Es­sen­tially, Mo­rales and Bo­livia rep­re­sent the re­pu­di­a­tion of ne­olib­er­al­ism and suc­cess of peo­ple-cen­tred poli­cies, in­clud­ing the as­ser­tion of a grow­ing re­source na­tion­al­ism re­solve that we are in­creas­ingly be­gin­ning to see in Africa. With the con­tin­ued ex­po­nen­tial rise of China, which is well on its way to be­come a global su­per­power, con­tin­ued progress in Rus­sia and ris­ing na­tion­al­ism in the US un­der the “Amer­ica First” agenda, the com­pe­ti­tion for re­sources mainly from Africa would likely be­come fever­ish and fre­netic. For the West, win­ning the cov­eted prize of abound­ing re­sources on the con­ti­nent would mean re­plac­ing rul­ing African regimes with pli­ant ones through its age-old tac­tics. This is why elec­tions in Africa, just like the Bo­li­vian elec­tions, are seem­ingly be­com­ing more con­tentious than be­fore. An in­vis­i­ble fin­ger is try­ing to tip the scales. Africa is back on the menu and its lead­ers are now smelling like goats that have to be de­voured. And so­cial me­dia is putting in quite a shift to try to ac­cen­tu­ate the smell of lead­ers on the African con­ti­nent. This time, how­ever, it is not go­ing to be that easy. Bishop out!",津巴布韦

Be­low are the excerpts of the in­ter­view: MC: There have been ar­gu­ments that bi­lat­eral aid has African economies poorer. What is your com­ment? MG: Any re­la­tion­ship be­tween and among coun­tries must be based on mu­tual co-op­er­a­tion. One of the tenets for Ef­fec­tive De­vel­op­ment Co-op­er­a­tion (EDC) is in­clu­sive part­ner­ships. Co-op­er­a­tion must ad­dress the in­ter­est of both par­ties in the agree­ment. Bi­lat­eral aid is not a sig­nif­i­cant fac­tor in mak­ing coun­tries in Africa poorer. Africa has its can of worms out­side of aid prob­lems, a crit­i­cal ar­ray of is­sues are at the epi­cen­tre of Africa’s slow pace in eco­nomic growth. These in­clude cor­rup­tion, hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions and in­ef­fi­cient util­i­sa­tion of do­mes­tic re­sources among oth­ers. Aid has also been abused or redi­rected to un­in­tended uses. Re­sources meant for health or ed­u­ca­tion are be­ing redi­rected to­wards strength­en­ing the se­cu­rity sec­tor. Some African lead­ers have been en­ter­ing into bi­lat­eral aid agree­ments with­out the con­sent of their peo­ple through es­tab­lished mech­a­nisms such as Par­lia­ments. Lack of trans­parency has con­trib­uted to the at­trac­tion of “Bad Aid”; that re­sulted in Africa los­ing more of its nat­u­ral re­sources through ex­change with aid. Apart from (this), bi­lat­eral aid has not been ef­fec­tively work­ing in Africa be­cause it comes with many strings tied to it, mostly serv­ing the in­ter­ests of donor coun­tries. US$24 bil­lion of de­vel­op­ment aid has been es­ti­mated to have found its way back to donor coun­tries, in­stead of ben­e­fit­ing Africa. MC: How has Zim­babwe and Africa ben­e­fited from aid? MG: Zim­babwe has been a re­cip­i­ent of both bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral aid since 1980. It is im­por­tant to note that about seven coun­tries in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa fund their so­cial pro­tec­tion pro­grammes through in­ter­na­tional aid. The aid has been di­rected to­wards ed­u­ca­tion, health, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion, pri­vate sec­tor, cli­mate fi­nance, democ­racy and good gov­er­nance among other sec­tors. A good ex­am­ple is in the health sec­tor. In 1988, the World Health Assem­bly adopted the goal of po­liomyeli­tis erad­i­ca­tion by the year 2000. More aid was chan­nelled to Africa, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe. In 1999, Zim­babwe was de­clared po­lio-free by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO). The pos­i­tive im­pact of aid is also felt in other sec­tors such as ed­u­ca­tion, in par­tic­u­lar girls' ed­u­ca­tion and aca­demic free­doms. Aid has helped in times of hu­man­i­tar­ian crises such as times of hunger, nat­u­ral dis­as­ters such as cy­clones. The re­cent Covid-19 pan­demic has seen more aid flow to Africa to com­ple­ment do­mes­tic ef­forts by govern­ments. MC: Who have been the main providers of ODA in Africa? MG: The main providers of ODA in the past 50 years are the high-in­come coun­tries, most of whom com­mit­ted 50 years ago to the spend­ing of 0,7% of their GNI to low and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries. In 1970, rich coun­tries com­mit­ted to shar­ing their in­comes for the de­vel­op­ment of the global South. In the 1970s, Swe­den, The Nether­lands, Den­mark, and Nor­way reached the 0,7% tar­get. In 1992, at the Rio Earth Sum­mit, the high-in­come coun­tries recom­mit­ted to the tar­get of aid to poor coun­tries. In 2000, af­ter the adop­tion of the UN Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals (MDGs), Lux­em­bourg reached the 0,7% tar­get. In 2005, the UK hosted the G8 Sum­mit, at which debt can­cel­la­tion and mo­bil­i­sa­tion of bil­lions of dol­lars for aid were agreed upon. In 2013 the UK reached the 0,7% goal. In the past 50 years, aid has been also chan­nelled through mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions such as the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, UN, World Bank, Africa De­vel­op­ment Bank, IMF and coun­tries like the United States of Amer­ica, Ja­pan, France, Switzer­land, Italy, Canada, Aus­tralia and oth­ers. The OECD, al­ways ranks the top ODA coun­tries. MC: Who are the main ben­e­fi­cia­ries of ODA in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries? MG: The fol­low­ing 10 coun­tries have been the high­est re­cip­i­ents of ODA: Ethiopia, Nige­ria, Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Egypt, DRC, Morocco, Uganda, South Su­dan and Mozambique. These coun­tries hosted 46% of ODA and other re­cip­i­ents hosted 56%. Most African coun­tries are el­i­gi­ble mem­bers of the ODA, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe. MC: What have been the chal­lenges as­so­ci­ated with ODA ac­count­abil­ity in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa and Zim­babwe in par­tic­u­lar? MG: ODA has cre­ated a de­pen­dency syn­drome, in­clud­ing in Zim­babwe. Most coun­tries in Africa have vast nat­u­ral re­sources but the vast­ness can­not be linked to eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, growth, or the gen­eral-good liv­ing con­di­tions of the peo­ple. Lack of ac­count­abil­ity in man­ag­ing ODA re­mains a wor­ry­ing phe­nom­e­non, with peo­ple ex­cluded from ac­cess­ing the in­for­ma­tion on agree­ments or the deals by the govern­ments. In Zim­babwe, Con­sti­tu­tional Amend­ment Bill Num­ber 2 is seek­ing to re­move the role played by par­lia­ment in in­ter­na­tional agree­ments. (It is) a sad de­vel­op­ment if it passes through. This will mean more debt bur­den or aid agree­ments that have a dire neg­a­tive re­sult on the citizens. MC: To what ex­tent has aid been tied/ un­tied? MG: Aid has largely been tied. Every coun­try’s for­eign pol­icy is aimed at ben­e­fit­ing its na­tional in­ter­ests, and largely its peo­ple. In do­ing so, high-in­come coun­tries and mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions place con­di­tions on low-in­come coun­tries as aid re­quire­ments. Aid is pro­jected to mainly ben­e­fit the donor coun­tries, as the re­sources find their way back. Some con­di­tions placed by in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions are based on ex­per­i­men­tal­ism type of eco­nom­ics, such as the case of the Zim­babwe Eco­nomic Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­gramme. In 2012, the UK pledged to spend about 88 mil­lion pounds per year un­til 2015, the ar­eas of sup­port were to help to pre­pare the ground for a cred­i­ble elec­tion, cre­at­ing more eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties for the peo­ple of Zim­babwe, im­prov­ing girls ed­u­ca­tion, cre­at­ing new jobs, im­prov­ing ma­ter­nal and child health and wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion. As good as it looks, the aid was tied to the ex­pec­ta­tion that there will be a tran­si­tion. The UK gov­ern­ment noted that if a po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion takes place dur­ing the pe­riod, they will scale up the de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme to help a re­form­ing gov­ern­ment. The whole aid ma­trix be­tween Zim­babwe and the UK clearly shows how that aid was tied and com­pro­mises the doc­trine of sov­er­eign states. The role of re­forms must be cen­tred on the citizens of that coun­try, not a for­eign power. The same can be pointed to the un­equal re­la­tion­ship be­tween Zim­babwe and China when it comes to ODA. MC: Can you say aid/ODA has been de­mand-driven? MG: The new de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion tra­jec­tory has set a pace to­wards new prin­ci­ples that calls for both high-in­come coun­tries and low-in­come coun­tries to co­op­er­ate based on the ac­tual needs of their peo­ple. Even though na­tions are strug­gling to shoot-out of their ego­cen­tric in­ter­est in aid, the new de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion frame­work has seen many coun­tries, with their de­vel­op­ment chal­lenges such as com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases, hu­man­i­tar­ian needs and ba­sic so­cial ser­vices be­ing fi­nanced from aid. This is a tes­ti­mony that the land­scape has been speed­ily shift­ing to­wards mu­tual co-op­er­a­tion that is de­mand-driven. For­eign fund­ing is com­ing in to re­spond to the needs of the govern­ments. Other donors are not yet flex­i­ble to adapt to the needs of the aid re­cip­i­ents. MC: What role should ODA/aid play to be an ef­fec­tive re­source for sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ment? MG: The new de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion land­scape has called for mu­tual co-op­er­a­tion. The new de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion frame­works call for a re­sults-fo­cused ap­proach. Coun­tries must utilise re­sources on ar­eas that bring eco­nomic growth and erad­i­cate poverty, tied to ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency. The ef­fi­cient util­i­sa­tion of do­mes­tic re­sources must be em­pha­sised, with zero tol­er­ance to cor­rup­tion and the curb­ing of il­licit fi­nan­cial flows. MC: At a time when the world is fac­ing one of its worst pan­demics in a gen­er­a­tion how do you en­vi­sion the fu­ture of in­ter­na­tional aid? MG: The ad­vent of coro­n­avirus has shifted both global pol­i­tics and global eco­nom­ics. The high-in­come coun­tries have at the present been af­fected by the virus more than low-in­come coun­tries. This has a neg­a­tive bear­ing on the 0,7% com­mit­ment to aid to­wards low-in­come coun­tries. MC: What de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion chal­lenges have re­cip­i­ent coun­tries faced? MG: The Is­tan­bul Prin­ci­ples for CSOs de­vel­op­ment ef­fec­tive­ness has brought the CSOs as an im­por­tant de­vel­op­ment ac­tor in the work of gov­ern­ment, of which most African govern­ments are hes­i­tant to em­brace this new nor­mal. The other chal­lenge has been re­duced aid flow, as some high-in­come coun­tries are fac­ing press­ing do­mes­tic chal­lenges that need an ur­gent re­source so­lu­tion. Coun­tries must utilise re­sources on ar­eas that bring eco­nomic growth and erad­i­cate poverty, tied to ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency. The ef­fi­cient util­i­sa­tion of do­mes­tic re­sources must be em­pha­sised, with zero tol­er­ance to cor­rup­tion and the curb­ing of il­licit fi­nan­cial flows.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170417,Aus­tralia beck­ons a war with China,"As Aus­tralian po­lit­i­cal, mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence es­tab­lish­ments are in­te­grated into the war plans of a grow­ing Amer­i­can ob­ses­sion — the shift of trad­ing, bank­ing and devel­op­ment power to the east — Aus­tralia is mak­ing an en­emy it never bar­gained for. AUS­TRALIA is sleep-walk­ing into a con­fronta­tion with China. Wars can hap­pen sud­denly in an at­mos­phere of mis­trust and provo­ca­tion, es­pe­cially if a mi­nor power, like Aus­tralia, aban­dons its in­de­pen­dence for an “al­liance” with an un­sta­ble su­per­power. The United States is at a crit­i­cal mo­ment. Hav­ing ex­ported its all-pow­er­ful man­u­fac­tur­ing base, run down its in­dus­try and re­duced mil­lions of its once-hope­ful peo­ple to poverty, prin­ci­pal Amer­i­can power to­day is brute force. When Don­ald Trump launched his mis­sile at­tack on Syria — fol­low­ing his bomb­ing of a mosque and a school — he was hav­ing din­ner in Florida with the Pres­i­dent of China, Xi Jin­ping. Trump’s at­tack on Syria had lit­tle to do with chem­i­cal weapons. It was, above all, to show his de­trac­tors and doubters in Wash­ing­ton’s war-mak­ing in­sti­tu­tions — the Pen­tagon, the CIA, the Congress — how tough he was and pre­pared to risk a war with Rus­sia. He had spilled blood in Syria, a Rus­sian pro­tec­torate; he was surely now on the team. The at­tack was also meant to say di­rectly to Pres­i­dent Xi, his din­ner guest: this is how we deal with those who chal­lenge the top dog. China has long re­ceived this mes­sage. In its rise as the world’s big­gest trader and man­u­fac­turer, China has been en­cir­cled by 400 US mil­i­tary bases — a provo­ca­tion de­scribed by a for­mer Pen­tagon strate­gist as “a per­fect noose”. This is not Trump’s do­ing. In 2011, Pres­i­dent Barack Obama flew to Aus­tralia to de­clare, in an ad­dress to par­lia­ment, what be­came known as the “pivot to Asia”: the big­gest build-up of US air and naval forces in the Asia Pa­cific re­gion since the Sec­ond World War. The tar­get was China. Amer­ica had a new and en­tirely un­nec­es­sary en­emy. To­day, low-draft US war­ships, mis­siles, bombers, drones op­er­ate on China’s doorstep. In July, one of the big­gest US-led naval exercises ever staged, the bi­en­nial Op­er­a­tion Tal­is­man Sabre, will re­hearse a block­ade of the sea lanes through which run China’s com­mer­cial life­lines. Based on a Air-Sea Bat­tle Plan for war with China, which pre­scribes a pre-emp­tive “blind­ing” at­tack, this “war game” will be played by Aus­tralia. This is not ur­gent news. Rather, the news is the “threat” that China poses to “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion” in the South China Sea by build­ing airstrips on dis­puted reefs and islets. The rea­son why — the “noose” — is al­most never men­tioned. Aus­tralia in the 21st cen­tury has no en­e­mies. Not even a melan­choly colo­nial imag­i­na­tion that con­jured Asia fall­ing down on us as if by the force of grav­ity can con­jure a sin­gle con­tem­po­rary en­emy. No one wants to bomb or occupy Aus­tralia. Well, not yet. As Aus­tralian po­lit­i­cal, mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence es­tab­lish­ments are in­te­grated into the war plans of a grow­ing Amer­i­can ob­ses­sion — the shift of trad­ing, bank­ing and devel­op­ment power to the east — Aus­tralia is mak­ing an en­emy it never bar­gained for. A front­line has al­ready been marked at Pine Gap, the spy base the CIA set up near Alice Springs in the 1960s, which tar­gets Amer­ica’s en­e­mies, beck­on­ing, of course, mas­sive re­tal­i­a­tion. Last Oc­to­ber, the op­po­si­tion La­bor Party’s de­fence spokesman, Richard Mar­les, de­lighted the US ad­mi­rals and gen­er­als at a con­fer­ence in Hawaii by de­mand­ing that Aus­tralian naval com­man­ders should have the au­thor­ity to pro­voke nu­clear-armed China in the dis­puted South China Sea. What is it about some Aus­tralian politi­cians whose ob­se­quious­ness takes charge of their senses? While the coali­tion gov­ern­ment of Mal­colm Turn­bull has re­sisted such a clear and present dan­ger, at least for now, it is build­ing a $195 bil­lion war ar­se­nal, one of the big­gest on earth — in­clud­ing more than $15 bil­lion to be spent on Amer­i­can F-35 fight­ers al­ready dis­tin­guished as hi-tech turkeys. Clearly, this is aimed at China. This view of Aus­tralia’s re­gion is shrouded by si­lence. Dis­senters are few, or fright­ened. Anti-China witch hunts are not un­com­mon. In­deed, who, apart from for­mer prime min­is­ter Paul Keat­ing, speaks out with an un­am­bigu­ous warn­ing? Who tells Aus­tralians that, in re­sponse to the “noose” around it, China has al­most cer­tainly in­creased its nu­clear weapons pos­ture from low alert to high alert? And who ut­ters the heresy that Aus­tralians should not have to “choose” be­tween Amer­ica and China: that we should, for the first time in our his­tory, be truly mod­ern and in­de­pen­dent of all great power: that we should play a thought­ful, imag­i­na­tive, non-provoca­tive, diplo­matic role to help pre­vent a catas­tro­phe and so pro­tect “our in­ter­ests”, which are the lives of peo­ple.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20181109,Rhino horns and tiger bones,"CHINA has demon­strated to the world that the health of its cit­i­zens is of para­mount im­por­tance. On Oc­to­ber 29, 2018, the gov­ern­ment of China pub­lished a no­tice that it was re­open­ing do­mes­tic trade in rhino horn and tiger bones. The no­tice states that “rhino horns and tiger bones” must be used in “medic­i­nal re­search or heal­ing” and “can only be ob­tained from farmed rhi­nos and tigers, not in­clud­ing those raised in zoos”. South­ern African coun­tries such as Eswa­tini, Namibia, South Africa and Zim­babwe all have Cap­tive Breed­ing Op­er­a­tions (CBO) fa­cil­i­ties and CBO­sourced rhino horn stock­piles that they can sell to China. Ar­ti­cle III of the UN Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) per­mits trade in oth­er­wise re­stricted wild an­i­mal parts for non-com­mer­cial pur­poses. The po­lit­i­cal par­ties in SADC coun­tries ought to im­me­di­ately recog­nise the so­cio-eco­nomic im­por­tance of the Chi­nese ini­tia­tive. SADC min­istries of en­vi­ron­ment need strong po­lit­i­cal sup­port. It was the African po­lit­i­cal par­ties that took the lead to fight against colo­nial op­pres­sion and ex­ploita­tion. The ANC also suc­cess­fully op­posed apartheid in South Africa and ended it. Dr Mor­ri­son Mt­sam­biwa, one of Africa’s top ecol­o­gists and for­mer CEO of the Ka­vango Zam­bezi Trans­fron­tier Con­ser­va­tion Area (where Botswana, Namibia, Zam­bia and Zim­babwe share their borders), praised China for tak­ing de­ci­sive ac­tion to buy rhino horn from CBO sources. He urged SADC po­lit­i­cal par­ties and gov­ern­ments to re­ject an­i­mal rights groups and an­nounce their readi­ness to sup­ply China’s needs. A Hwange Ru­ral Dis­trict Coun­cil ecol­o­gist, Mr Nx­ole­lani Ncube, said that China’s re­open­ing of the rhino horn trade has made coun­tries with smaller rhino pop­u­la­tions “see the in­cen­tive for mas­sive breed­ing of white rhi­nos”. Sovereign right The large an­i­mal rights groups — Save the Rhino Foun­da­tion In­ter­na­tional and the World Wide Fund for Na­ture (WWF) — in­stantly op­posed China’s ini­tia­tive, claim­ing that re­open­ing the rhino horn trade would in­crease poach­ing. They still have not learnt the es­sen­tial les­son that a ban on in­ter­na­tional trade in wildlife prod­ucts has not stopped poach­ing af­ter more than 40 years of try­ing. Ein­stein is said to have ob­served that the sign of mad­ness is do­ing the same thing over and over again and ex­pect­ing a dif­fer­ent re­sult. South­ern Africa needs to pay at­ten­tion to China’s lead in ex­er­cis­ing its sovereign right to buy rhino horn for the med­i­cal needs of its peo­ple. SADC coun­tries also ought to ar­tic­u­late their sovereign right to sell their re­sources for rhino con­ser­va­tion and for the so­cio-eco­nomic well-be­ing of their peo­ple. Eu­gene La­pointe, for­mer CITES sec­re­tary-gen­eral (1982-1990) and pres­i­dent of the Switzer­land-based IWMC-World Con­ser­va­tion Trust, said: “… we share a com­mon opin­ion with China … that the old or­der gov­ern­ing the trade in wildlife prod­ucts . . . is in need of ur­gent re­form”. An­i­mal rights groups have for a long time been im­pos­ing their anti-wildlife prod­ucts trade agenda on Africa. Now it is time for SADC coun­tries to move for­ward. There­fore, it was strongly rec­om­mended to them at a meet­ing held in Pre­to­ria, South Africa, in Au­gust 2018 that they should de­clare CITES de­ci­sions they deemed un­fair to their in­ter­ests as “null and void”, as the CITES treaty per­mits. In sup­port­ing the Chi­nese ini­tia­tive on rhino horns and tiger bones be­fore the 2019 CITES meet­ing, they will be tak­ing a fur­ther step to­wards align­ing them­selves with a wildlife pol­icy that makes sense to Africa. Nearly ev­ery­one in the SADC coun­tries knows that as long as rhi­nos do not have eco­nomic value to the peo­ple who live among them, there will be no need to pro­tect them from poach­ers. Giv­ing rhi­nos the kind of value that the Chi­nese are now cre­at­ing pro­vides the rea­son to pro­tect them. “China has taken a prin­ci­pled po­si­tion on rhi­nos and tigers, and has a very strong back­bone to al­low it to stand tall and straight against the in­evitable back­lash of the an­i­mal rights groups. The gov­ern­ing par­ties of the SADC coun­tries should need noth­ing more in the way of po­lit­i­cal cover to join China in en­thu­si­as­ti­cally sup­port­ing its new ini­tia­tive,” said the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Los An­ge­les-based Ivory Ed­u­ca­tion In­sti­tute, God­frey Har­ris. As poverty, un­em­ploy­ment and poor eco­nomic growth con­tin­ues to plague some SADC coun­tries, it would seem that only those gov­ern­ments al­ready cap­tured by an­i­mal rights groups would op­pose sell­ing their CBO-sourced rhino horn to China. Ac­cord­ingly, SADC’s en­vi­ron­men­tal min­istries (led by their po­lit­i­cal par­ties), need to make a col­lec­tive ef­fort to­wards im­ple­ment­ing the Chi­nese rhino horn trade ini­tia­tive, in or­der to de­feat rhino poach­ing. The SADC habi­tat-dam­ag­ing ele­phant over­pop­u­la­tion prob­lems present an op­por­tu­nity for SADC and China to en­gage in new ne­go­ti­a­tions to re­open trade in ivory in the fu­ture. ◆ Em­manuel Koro is a Jo­han­nes­burg-based in­ter­na­tional award-win­ning en­vi­ron­men­tal jour­nal­ist who has writ­ten ex­ten­sively on en­vi­ron­ment and devel­op­ment is­sues in Africa.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20141220,Com­pet­i­tive pres­sures,"Since the 1970s, the World Bank has been a pi­o­neer in work­ing to en­sure that its de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance does not lead to or ex­ac­er­bate cer­tain forms of dis­crim­i­na­tion or en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion. Yet the in­sti­tu­tion has never man­dated that the pro­grammes it funds com­ply with in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights stan­dards, largely on the con­cern that politi­cis­ing the bank’s lend­ing could com­pli­cate its coun­tryby- coun­try anti- poverty fo­cus. ( Oth­ers, in­clud­ing Al­ston, main­tain that hu­man rights can no longer be con­sid­ered a po­lit­i­cal is­sue.) Con­sen­sus is grow­ing, how­ever, around the idea that sus­tain­able de­vel- op­ment is im­pos­si­ble with­out a specifi c fo­cus on hu­man rights. Other mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing the UN De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme, have ex­plic­itly brought their as­sis­tance guide­lines in line with in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights obli­ga­tions. At the same time, the World Bank is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing greater com­pet­i­tive pres­sure. Ac­cord­ing to many an­a­lysts, in­clud­ing this week’s let­ter, this is due to the re­cent cre­ation of sev­eral new mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment lenders, funded par­tic­u­larly by fast- ris­ing economies in­clud­ing China, Rus­sia and In­dia. Th ese en­ti­ties are widely ex­pected to put less em­pha­sis on pre- scrip­tive and at times labou­ri­ous re­quire­ments such as the World Bank’s en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial safe­guards. In such a con­text, how­ever, Al­ston and oth­ers say the bank has an added re­spon­si­bil­ity to fo­cus on the re­sults that, they sug­gest, only core re­spect for hu­man rights can bring. Th e bank’s man­age­ment coun­ters that the in­sti­tu­tion has been a leader in high­light­ing the in­ter­de­pen­dence be­tween re­spect for hu­man rights and de­vel­op­ment out­comes for at least two decades. To­day, offi cials in­volved with the safe­guard re­view main­tain that both hu­man rights and non- dis­crim­i­na­tion prin­ci­ples have been ex­panded upon in the new draft. “Our draft pro­posal goes as far or fur­ther than any other mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment bank in the de­gree to which it pro­tects the vul­ner­a­ble and the marginalised,” Ste­fan Koe­berle, the bank’s di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions risk, told IPS in a state­ment. “We are cur­rently en­gaged in ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tions on the draft, and we have re­ceived a va­ri­ety of con­struc­tive pro­pos­als to strengthen the lan­guage fur­ther.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170721,African cities can ben­e­fit from twin­ning with Chi­nese coun­ter­parts,"ONE of the suc­cess sto­ries of the con­tem­po­rary Chi­nese so­cio-eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion is its lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tive sys­tem, which gives lo­cal gov­ern­ments some au­ton­omy to take charge of their de­vel­op­ment agenda. Each lo­cal govern­ment in China is ex­pected to take a cen­tral and ac­tive role in de­vel­op­ing its own econ­omy. For ex­am­ple, towns and cities are given greater au­thor­ity to con­trol cer­tain pub­lic ser­vices such as land and credit al­lo­ca­tion since lo­cal gov­ern­ments are the clos­est to the people. This sys­tem has cre­ated “pos­i­tive” com­pe­ti­tion among Chi­nese towns to out­per­form each other eco­nom­i­cally — ul­ti­mately — trans­form­ing lo­cal gov­ern­ments from mere agents who carry out the ob­jec­tives of cen­tral govern­ment to be­ing ma­jor eco­nomic ac­tors in their own right. In fact, this ap­proach has en­sured that de­vel­op­ment is in­cre­men­tal as it starts at the lo­cal level and grows to other parts of the coun­try. Once the towns reach cer­tain lev­els of de­vel­op­ment, they are ex­pected to as­sist the less de­vel­oped cities to also at­tain eco­nomic growth. The sit­u­a­tion is slight dif­fer­ent in most African coun­tries where lo­cal gov­ern­ments due to var­i­ous chal­lenges seem to play a se­condary role in de­vel­op­ing their economies. Cog­nisant of the im­por­tant role of lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tive sys­tems in pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, China and Africa have iden­ti­fied lo­cal govern­ment as a pri­or­ity de­vel­op­ment area in their strate­gic part­ner­ship. Ac­cord­ing to the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) Jo­han­nes­burg Ac­tion Plan (2016-2018) adopted by the sum­mit held in Jo­han­nes­burg, South Africa in December 2015, China and Africa agreed to work to­gether in strength­en­ing the ca­pac­ity of lo­cal gov­ern­ments to con­trib­ute to­wards so­cio-eco­nomic growth. “The two sides (China and Africa) will pro­mote ex­changes and co­op­er­a­tion be­tween lo­cal gov­ern­ments, and sup­port the es­tab­lish­ment of more sis­ter prov­inces/cities re­la­tion­ships, as well as the in­sti­tu­tion­al­iza­tion of the China-Africa Fo­rum on Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Lo­cal Gov­ern­ments,” reads part of the FOCAC Jo­han­nes­burg Ac­tion Plan. Sig­nif­i­cant progress has been made to pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Chi­nese and African lo­cal gov­ern­ments, par­tic­u­larly in twin­ning of prov­inces and cities. Africa has a lot to ben­e­fit from these twin­ning ar­range­ment as Chi­nese towns have clearly demon­strated that they can ac­tively con­trib­ute to­wards sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Twin­ning of towns pro­vides a num­ber of op­por­tu­ni­ties in­clud­ing trade and tourism, as well as the ex­change of in­for­ma­tion and ex­per­tise in ur­ban plan­ning, ar­chi­tec­ture, mu­nic­i­pal im­prove­ments, trans­port, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and ur­ban gov­er­nance and cul­ture. Col­lab­o­rat­ing be­tween towns also has the ca­pac­ity to create strate­gies that are geared to­wards pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and ad­dress­ing ur­ban poverty. Fur­ther­more, the es­tab­lish­ment of twin­ning ar­range­ments be­tween some of the lead­ing in­dus­trial parks in China and African cities with in­dus­trial as­pi­ra­tions would help to ac­cel­er­ate the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion agenda of the con­ti­nent. In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is at the top agenda of most African coun­tries in­clud­ing those from the South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC) who want to trans­form their economies from pre­dom­i­nately based on trade in pri­mary prod­ucts to trade in man­u­fac­tures. In this re­gard, twin­ning with Chi­nese towns that have in­dus­tri­alised their economies would at­tract the nec­es­sary in­vest­ment needed to trans­form African cities into manufacturing cen­tres. In Zim­babwe, the city of Harare has en­tered into a twin­ning ar­range­ment with Guangzhou city, re­garded as the re­gional cen­tre and com­mu­ni­ca­tion hub of China, which has a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment with the city of Dur­ban in South Africa. In ad­di­tion, Harare prov­ince has a twin­ning ar­range­ment with Zhe­jiang prov­ince, also in south­ern China. The city of Gaborone in Botswana is also twinned with Zhe­jiang Prov­ince, while a num­ber of other cities in Africa have also twinned with var­i­ous Chi­nese towns. It is crit­i­cal for lo­cal gov­ern­ments in Africa to take ad­van­tages of these twin­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to im­prove ser­vice de­liv­ery, as lo­cal gov­ern­ments are im­por­tant pil­lars of gov­er­nance in the pro­vi­sion of ba­sic ser­vices such as roads, wa­ter, san­i­ta­tion and hous­ing. China has proved that lo­cal gov­ern­ments have a role to play in pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, hence Africa should learn from the Chi­nese ex­pe­ri­ence. Most im­por­tant, China has shown com­mit­ment in as­sist­ing Africa to de­velop its econ­omy. To fur­ther ce­ment re­la­tions and pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Chi­nese and African lo­cal gov­ern­ments, the two sides have es­tab­lished the China-Africa Fo­rum on Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Lo­cal Gov­ern­ments. The Fo­rum was es­tab­lished in August 2012 within the frame­works of FOCAC. Since its in­cep­tion, the fo­rum has met twice with the last meet­ing held in Bei­jing, China in 2015. At the last meet­ing, the fo­rum agreed to con­tinue work­ing to­gether in shar­ing ex­pe­ri­ences of de­vel­op­ment, as well as strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, trade, in­vest­ment, and agri­cul­ture and people-to-people ex­changes. China and Africa share a long­stand­ing re­la­tion­ship. In­creased China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion in the last few decades has opened up a new win­dow of col­lab­o­ra­tion and part­ner­ship, boost­ing trade better the con­ti­nent and the Asian nation. The lat­est fig­ures in­di­cate that trade be­tween the two had reached US$220 bil­lion in 2014 while China’s di­rect in­vest­ment in Africa topped US$30 bil­lion in the same year.",津巴布韦

And there are many ad­van­tages ac­cru­ing from the con­ti­nent win­ning this con­would There is hope that with an African at the helm of the UNWTO, fo­cus will be re-di­rected to­wards the po­ten­tial that tourism has to lift many coun­tries on the con­ti­nent out of poverty. In its low state, tourism is al­ready play­ing a piv­otal role in help­ing turn around the sta­tus of many African coun­tries by sig­nif­i­cantly con­tribut­ing to the fis­cus. But the sta­tus of tourism in Africa can im­prove pretty fast if an African is at the apex of the world tourism body. That world tourism has to take a new di­rec­tion is in no doubt, con­sid­er­ing the po­ten­tial that this tril­lion-dol­lar in­dus­try holds. And China has al­ready taken the first steps to­wards turn­ing around global tourism af­ter it held the suc­cess­ful First World Con­fer­ence on Tourism and Devel­op­ment in Bei­jing in May last year. The theme of that con­fer­ence, “Tourism for Peace and Devel­op­ment”, said it all in terms of the ex­pec­ta­tions that this vast in­dus­try can con­trib­ute to make the world a bet­ter place. For Africa, peace, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and devel­op­ment are the ma­jor pre­req­ui­sites for fu­ture sta­bil­ity. It is a fact that many African coun­tries lag far be­hind in devel­op­ment, while some have not known peace for many decades due to in­ter­nal strife. Min­is­ter Mzembi has al­ready made clear one of his goals - to use tourism as a tool of public diplo­macy to mit­i­gate against ter­ror­ism, wars and un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Al­though Min­is­ter Mzembi is likely to face stiff com­pe­ti­tion from can­di­dates from Europe and the Amer­i­cas, he is con­fi­dent of tri­umph­ing. “There is a very pos­i­tive ac­cep­tance of my state­craft and bu­reau­cratic com­pe­tence for this post,” he said in a widely pub­lished in­ter­view re­cently. “Re­mem­ber, this is an elec­tive in­ter­na­tional civil ser­vant po­si­tion which re­quires com­pe­tent skills. I have been around long enough to know where to take the or­gan­i­sa­tion (UNWTO) in ful­fill­ing mem­bers’ as­pi­ra­tions and ex­pec­ta­tions. “The pedi­gree of my can­di­da­ture goes be­yond just ad­vo­cacy, mar­ket­ing and pro­mo­tion of global tourism to in­ter­na­tional deal broking and states­man­ship, which are all hall­marks needed to con­front con­tem­po­rary chal­lenges.” Global tourism is now big busi­ness, gen­er­at­ing $1,5 tril­lion, con­tribut­ing 6 per­cent in ex­ports and em­ploy­ing around 288 mil­lion peo­ple from nearly 1,2 bil­lion ar­rivals. The lat­est global tourism barom­e­ter shows that Africa ac­counts for only 3 to 5 per­cent of the mar­ket and is the only re­gion that reg­is­tered a de­cline in ar­rivals per­for­mance at mi­nus 3 per­cent in the last few years. The Mid­dle East claims al­most the same mar­ket share, while Europe ac­counts for more than 50 per­cent and the Amer­i­cas, Asia and Pa­cific re­gions have al­most an equal share of the re­main­der. Min­is­ter Mzembi wishes to en­sure that there is uni­ver­sal State mem­ber­ship of the UNWTO and also speaks of work­ing on ad­vanc­ing the vi­sion of open bor­ders, open skies and visa lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. He says it is time that tourism’s “nat­u­ral patent to soft power” is de­ployed in public and peo­ple-to-peo­ple diplo­macy to help fight scourges like ter­ror­ism. “It is not hard power alone that will de­feat ter­ror­ism,” he said in an in­ter­view. “It is com­ple­men­tary ac­tion from soft power that will ul­ti­mately win be­cause ter­ror­ism is con­ceived and trans­ported in the mind. “We must never al­low a sit­u­a­tion where af­ter tra­di­tional diplo­macy fails it pre­cip­i­tates war be­fore we in­voke the in­her­ent diplo­matic char­ac­ter­is­tics of tourism.” “When peo­ple ar­rive in des­ti­na­tions, they are agents of good­will. Usu­ally they bring an olive branch, so to­day’s 1,2 bil­lion global ar­rivals can eas­ily be turned into peace am­bas­sadors of this world.” The ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil of the UNWTO held in Luxor, Egypt, in Oc­to­ber last year set the guide­lines and roadmap for the elec­tion of the next sec­re­tary-gen­eral. The roadmap in­cludes the alert­ing of mem­ber states to the va­cant post, as­pir­ing can­di­dates be­ing in­vited to present their cre­den­tials and the rec­om­men­da­tion of can­di­dates to the gen­eral assem­bly. But global tourism an­a­lysts be­lieve it’s time for Africa, and if this hap­pens it will be the first time ever that an African will hold the pow­er­ful post of UNWTO Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral since 1975 when it was first oc­cu­pied. Cre­ated in 1974, UNWTO is one of the spe­cialised agen­cies of the United Na­tions. China is al­ready pre­par­ing to host the UNWTO Gen­eral Assem­bly, which is ex­pected to be the big­gest ever. Speak­ing af­ter win­ning the bid to host the UNWTO Gen­eral Assem­bly last year, China Na­tional Tourism Ad­min­is­tra­tion chair­man Li Jin­zao said the coun­try was ready to play its part in global tourism. “China will make thor­ough prepa­ra­tions for it and will en­deav­our to make the UNWTO Gen­eral Assem­bly into a plat­form where tourism de­part­ments from across the world can con­duct can­did and in-depth com­mu­ni­ca­tion and fo­cus on co­op­er­a­tion,” he told Xin­hua News Agency then. “China’s bid for the 22nd Ses­sion man­i­fests its as­pi­ra­tion to work to­gether with other coun­tries to ham­mer out big plans and share fruits of devel­op­ment by util­is­ing the plat­form of­fered by the ses­sion. Ac­tu­ally, China has ac­cu­mu­lated rich ex­pe­ri­ence in host­ing large in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences. We have all the con­fi­dence to make the ses­sion a suc­cess.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190428,‘China’s BRI tonic for ED eco­nomic vi­sion’,"CHINA’S sig­na­ture for­eign trade pol­icy, the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI), is set to ac­cel­er­ate Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s drive to es­tab­lish an up­per mid­dle-in­come econ­omy within the next 11 years, a Cab­i­net Min­is­ter has said. In her re­marks in Bei­jing at a high-level BRI meet­ing at­tended by sev­eral min­is­ters from around the world, In­for­ma­tion, Pub­lic­ity and Broad­cast­ing Ser­vices Min­is­ter Mon­ica Mutsvangwa said BRI had come at the most op­por­tune time as it feeds into the coun­try’s Vi­sion 2030. A brain­child of China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, BRI aims to re-cre­ate the an­cient Silk Road trade routes with the rest of the world and open up trade op­por­tu­ni­ties worth tril­lions of dol­lars. “My Pres­i­dent (Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa) has the grand na­tional vi­sion to trans­form Zim­babwe into a mod­ern mid­dle-in­come coun­try by 2030. To achieve this no­ble goal, he is cham­pi­oning the mantra ‘Zim­babwe Is Open for Busi­ness’. He is keenly de­ter­mined that Zim­babwe at­tracts the for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment that is key to ful­fil his na­tional vi­sion. He has duly in­structed his peo­ple to learn from global best prac­tice and to pro­ceed to ex­cel in of­fer­ing the most hos­pitable cli­mate to en­ter­pris­ing global cap­i­tal.” BRI, she added, essen­tially shows China’s am­bi­tion to share eco­nomic growth with de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Min­is­ter Mutsvangwa - who spent sev­eral years in Bei­jing when her hus­band, Am­bas­sador Christo­pher Mutsvangwa, was Zim­babwe’s top en­voy to China - de­scribed the world’s sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy’s me­te­oric rise to pros­per­ity as “the most fre­netic pace of eco­nomic changes ever in the his­tory of hu­mankind”. She said Zim­babwe seeks to be “a good part­ner” to China un­der the BRI. “My na­tion of Zim­babwe knows this Chi­nese at­tribute of China as a well-mean­ing friend. In­deed ours is a case study and my pres­ence here speaks vol­umes of our ea­ger­ness to learn and share with­out imagined fear or prej­u­dice.” In his speech at the sum­mit’s clos­ing yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Xi said deals worth more than US$64 bil­lion had been signed last week alone, with more deals ex­pected to be penned in the com­ing years. In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view with The Sun­day Mail, China’s Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Guo Shaochun said Harare is poised for mas­sive spin-offs from BRI. “The sec­ond BRI sum­mit in Bei­jing has been very suc­cess­ful. It intends to con­nect China to the world through five pillars, which are pol­icy co­or­di­na­tion, trade con­nec­tiv­ity, fi­nan­cial con­nec­tiv­ity, in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity and peo­ple-to-peo­ple con­nec­tiv­ity. “Zim­babwe and China are close friends and re­cently our re­la­tions were el­e­vated from all-weather friends to com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship. “The BRI pro­vides the frame­work to raise our re­la­tions to an even higher level. We want to chal­lenge the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment, through their tech­nocrats, to work out the strate­gies with us, on how we can el­e­vate the re­la­tions,” he said. Bei­jing, he added, will con­tinue to push Chi­nese en­ter­prises to in­vest in the coun­try in or­der to pro­mote eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. The en­voy be­lieves the ease of do­ing busi­ness re­forms has the po­ten­tial to at­tract more in­vest­ments. The BRI sum­mit, which at­tracted more than 37 lead­ers from Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin Amer­ica and se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials from over 100 coun­tries, ended yes­ter­day ◆ Iar­rived in Harare last month and I have al­ready had a deep im­pres­sion of the beau­ti­ful scenery, pleasant cli­mate and won­der­ful peo­ple of Zim­babwe. I am es­pe­cially moved by the friend­ship that Zim­bab­wean peo­ple ex­tend to me, my fam­ily and the Chi­nese peo­ple. China and Zim­babwe are far apart in geog­ra­phy, but we feel close to each other emo­tion­ally and psy­cho­log­i­cally. Be­fore com­ing here, I was di­rec­tor gen­eral of the con­sular depart­ment of the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs of China and one of my im­por­tant mis­sions is to pro­mote peo­ple to peo­ple ex­changes be­tween China and for­eign coun­tries. Last year, Zim­babwe Gov­ern­ment de­cided to adopt a visa-on-ar­rival pol­icy to Chi­nese vis­i­tors. This pol­icy is bring­ing more Chi­nese tourists to Zim­babwe and pro­mot­ing the mu­tual un­der­stand­ing be­tween the peo­ple of our two coun­tries. This is just an ex­am­ple of our ex­pand­ing co­op­er­a­tion across a wide range of ar­eas. China is the big­gest and ris­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­try and Africa is the ris­ing con­ti­nent that has the largest num­ber of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. It is, there­fore, im­por­tant to have an in-depth un­der­stand­ing of China-Africa re­la­tions. China-Africa re­la­tion­ship started in an­cient times. The great Chi­nese nav­i­ga­tor Zhenghe led seven ocean ex­pe­di­tions and he reached as far as to­day’s Mozam­bique, east coast of Africa. Porce­lain and other pre­cious ar­ti­facts unearthed from the ru­ins of the Great Zim­babwe also ev­i­denced that there were ex­changes be­tween China and Zim­babwe a thou­sand years ago. China-Africa re­la­tions sig­nif­i­cantly ac­cel­er­ated af­ter World War II, when the strug­gle for self-de­ter­mi­na­tion and in­de­pen­dence was sweep­ing across the world. As early as 1950s and 1960s, China be­gan to pro­vide strong po­lit­i­cal, moral and ma­te­rial support to African peo­ple in their rev­o­lu­tion­ary strug­gle. We trained thou­sands of free­dom fight­ers for Zim­babwe in the Tan­za­nian mil­i­tary camp as well as in China. Even to­day, some vet­eran sol­diers of Zim­babwe who re­ceived mil­i­tary train­ing in China can still sing the song of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s lib­er­a­tion Army. Dur­ing that pe­riod, Africa also gave enor­mous support to China. In 1971, with ma­jor­ity support from African coun­tries, the 26th Gen­eral As­sem­bly of the United Na­tions adopted a res­o­lu­tion that re­stored the legal seat of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. In the words of late Chair­man Mao, “it is our African broth­ers who car­ried us into the United Na­tions”. The sec­ond cli­max in China-Africa re­la­tions came around the start of the new mil­len­nium when China and Africa es­tab­lished the FOCAC (Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion) mech­a­nism in 2000. Since then, China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion has made huge progress in all ar­eas, es­pe­cially in the eco­nomic sphere. China has been the big­gest trad­ing part­ner of Africa for nine con­sec­u­tive years, with the trade vol­ume of US$204.2 bil­lion in 2018. The trade be­tween the two sides is roughly bal­anced, with China’s ex­port to Africa at US$104,9 bil­lion and China’s im­port from Africa at US$99,38 bil­lion. China en­joys a small sur­plus of US$5,63 bil­lion. China’s ac­cu­mu­lated in­vest­ment to Africa has grown from less than US$100 mil­lion in 2000 to to­day’s over US$100 bil­lion. What are the rea­sons and driv­ers be­hind China-Africa boom­ing co­op­er­a­tion? The rea­sons can be sum­marised by three “C”s. The First “C” rep­re­sents the “call”, mean­ing that China has re­sponded to the calls for de­vel­op­ment of African coun­tries. It is com­mon sense that a coun­try needs a huge amount of cap­i­tal and a se­ries of in­fra­struc­ture con­struc­tion in its eco­nomic take­off and early stage of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. African coun­tries are no ex­cep­tion. The as­sis­tance that China pro­vides as its abil­ity per­mits, is a re­sponse to the call of African coun­tries. Only by real­is­ing self-sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, could Africa end poverty and con­flict, and achieve durable peace and sta­bil­ity. The Sec­ond “c” stands for “ca­pac­ity”. It is not enough to help oth­ers sim­ply with pas­sion. Ca­pac­ity and abil­ity are es­sen­tial. This year marks the 70th an­niver­sary of the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China. Over the past 70 years, China has tra­versed an ex­tra­or­di­nary path, mak­ing out­stand­ing achieve­ments in its eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment. What is the recipe for China’s suc­cess so far? The core rea­son, I would say, is the lead­er­ship of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nity Party, which is the back­bone of the na­tion. Ever since mod­ern times, China has made nu­mer­ous tri­als and er­rors and only af­ter we had the lead­er­ship of the Com­mu­nist Party, the na­tions has achieved in­de­pen­dence and grown pros­per­ous and strong. The Com­mu­nist Party of China is the choice of his­tory and the choice of the Chi­nese peo­ple. Cer­tainly, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party had stum­bles, set­backs and made mis­takes, but it has the courage to ad­mit mis­takes, make cor­rec­tions and charge on. It has kept re­new­ing it­self to stay abreast with the times. And it has main­tained close links with the Chi­nese peo­ple. Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has given the best ex­pla­na­tion of this point. He said, “The as­pi­ra­tions of the peo­ple to live a bet­ter life must al­ways be the fo­cus of our ef­forts.” In the past 70 years, China had grown from a low-in­come coun­try that could barely pro­vide food and cloth­ing to its peo­ple to a mid­dle-in­come coun­try en­joy­ing mod­er­ate pros­per­ity. At least 740 mil­lion peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty; the mid­dle-in­come pop­u­la­tion is now more than 300 mil­lion; the world’s largest so­cial se­cu­rity sys­tem has been es­tab­lished cov­er­ing old-age pen­sion, health care, ba­sic al­lowances and wel­fare hous­ing. In ad­di­tion the av­er­age life ex­pectancy has gone up from 67.8 in 1981 to 76.7 in 2017. With the de­vel­op­ment of China, we have been able to put more re­sources to China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion. Dur­ing the Jo­han­nes­burg sum­mit of FOCAC in 2015, China pro­vided US$60 bil­lion to African coun­tries. And at the Bei­jing Sum­mit of FOCAC last year, China pledged an­other US$60 bil­lion to pro­mote the de­vel­op­ment of Africa fo­cus­ing on 8 ma­jor ar­eas, namely in­dus­trial pro­mo­tion, in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity, trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, green de­vel­op­ment, ca­pac­ity build­ing, health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes and peace and se­cu­rity. A grow­ing China will nat­u­rally bring more op­por­tu­ni­ties and ben­e­fits to Africa. The third “c” stands for “cir­cum­stances” or “con­di­tion”. We have the right con­di­tions for the de­vel­op­ment of China-Africa re­la­tions. The salient fea­tures of China-Africa re­la­tions are equal­ity, sin­cer­ity, mu­tual respect and win-win re­sults. China sees Africa as equal. We al­ways ad­vo­cate that coun­tries, big or small, rich or poor are equal mem­bers of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. We op­pose the big bul­ly­ing the small or the rich op­press­ing the poor. We are against uni­lat­eral and il­le­gal sanc­tions rudely ap­plied against other coun­tries. In en­gag­ing with African coun­tries, we ap­ply a five- “no”-ap­proach, as clearly elab­o­rated by Pres­i­dent Xin­ping at the 2018 Bei­jing Sum­mit of FOCAC, that is: no in­ter­fer­ence in African coun­tries’ pur­suit of de­vel­op­ment paths that fit their na­tional con­di­tions; no in­ter­fer­ence in African coun­tries’ internal af­fairs; no im­po­si­tion of our will on African coun­tries; no at­tach­ment of po­lit­i­cal strings to as­sis­tance to Africa; and no seek­ing of self­ish po­lit­i­cal gains in in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing co­op­er­a­tion with Africa. This five - “no”- ap­proach shows the respect for Africa and we will al­ways take Africa’s in­ter­ests into con­sid­er­a­tion and never pur­sue “China first” pol­icy. These form the po­lit­i­cal trust and right at­mos­phere for China-Africa re­la­tions to blos­som and yield fruits. How­ever, China-Africa re­la­tions are not with­out grow­ing pains or head­winds. Some coun­tries or peo­ple have been ac­cus­ing China of set­ting a debt trap for African coun­tries by pro­vid­ing bur­den­some loans to them. I would say this is ut­terly ground­less. The debt is­sue of Africa is a com­plex his­toric is­sue and China is never the cul­prit to blame. In fact and ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics, from 2000 to 2016, the debt owed to China only accounts for 1,8 per­cent of the to­tal ex­ter­nal debt of African coun­tries. If we take a closer look at the African coun­tries that are heav­ily in debt, China is not their main cred­i­tor. Take Zim­babwe as an ex­am­ple, as high as 77 per­cent of its gov­ern­ment debt are owed to the Paris Club and other mul­ti­lat­eral cred­i­tors, not to China. On the con­trary, China al­ways con­ducts a care­ful fea­si­bil­ity study and mar­ket re­search, so that each project will de­liver eco­nomic and so­cial ben­e­fits as ex­pected. While some coun­tries keep on claim­ing that they worry about Africa’s debt prob­lem, they are not will­ing to pro­vide fi­nan­cial re­sources or make in­vest­ment in Africa, or worse still, they im­pose sanc­tions on African coun­tries, hold­ing back the econ­omy and mak­ing or­di­nary peo­ple suf­fer. Some coun­tries or peo­ple also ac­cuse China of loot­ing African re­sources as “neo-colonists”. China does buy nat­u­ral re­sources from Africa, but this trade pat­tern ex­ists be­tween Africa and its other ma­jor trad­ing part­ners as well. China and Africa trade ac­cord­ing to mar­ket rules and on a will­ing buyer will­ing seller ba­sis. More­over, China is now do­ing more to add value to the nat­u­ral re­sources of Africa by set­ting up pro­cess­ing plants in Africa. China has no in­ten­tion and no abil­ity of mo­nop­o­lis­ing Africa’s co­op­er­a­tion with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. We wel­come all ef­forts that can truly help Africa’s de­vel­op­ment and look for­ward to work­ing with coun­tries around the world to help Africa de­velop. Only African peo­ple have the fi­nal say over whether China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion is good or bad. Zim­babwe is a jewel of Africa and also a strate­gic part­ner of China. We es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties on the day of Zim­babwe’s dec­la­ra­tion of in­de­pen­dence. Since then, great changes took place in both our coun­tries, but our friend­ship has re­mained strong and stead­fast. We al­ways ap­pre­ci­ate the ad­her­ence to the “One-China” prin­ci­ple by Zim­babwe and Zim­babwe al­ways cher­ishes the valu­able support China gave it when China ve­toed the pro­posed UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil res­o­lu­tion to im­pose sanc­tions on Zim­babwe, which has been the first and so far the only time China ex­er­cised veto power in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil for an African coun­try. In re­cent years, China-Zim­babwe re­la­tions have gained sub­stan­tial mo­men­tum and progress on mul­ti­ple fronts. Our po­lit­i­cal mu­tual trust has been fur­ther ce­mented with fre­quent high-level ex­change of vis­its. Last year, Pres­i­dent ED Mnan­gagwa paid vis­its to China twice and he agreed with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to el­e­vate our bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship to the com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship of co­op­er­a­tion, which marked a new era of the re­la­tion­ship. Our prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion was boosted by the com­ple­tion or tak­ing off of some mega projects. One is the Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port ex­pan­sion project, which so­lid­i­fies the po­si­tion of the city as re­gional hub for avi­a­tion. It is also a sig­nif­i­cant con­trib­u­tor to the tourism rev­enue of Zim­babwe, which recorded 2,6 mil­lion tourist ar­rivals last year, up 12 per­cent from the pre­vi­ous year. Zim­babwe has been rec­om­mended re­cently by mul­ti­ple in­ter­na­tional agen­cies as the mustvisit place and one of the ma­jor rea­sons for the rec­om­men­da­tion is the up­graded Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port. Now the Robert Gabriel Mu­gabe In­ter­na­tional Air­port is also be­ing up­graded and ren­o­vated with the as­sis­tance of China. China also helped fi­nance and com­plete the Kariba South power plant ex­pan­sion project, which added 300MW to the na­tional grid of Zim­babwe, bring­ing down the bill of elec­tric­ity im­port of Zim­babwe by half for ev­ery month. An­other big project, Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion ex­pan­sion is un­der­way and will be com­pleted in less than three years. By the time of com­ple­tion, it will have cre­ated 3 000 jobs for Zim­bab­weans and add an­other 600 MW to Zim­babwe and help it gain en­ergy suf­fi­ciency. Chi­nese com­pa­nies have made sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion to the Zim­bab­wean so­ci­ety. They em­ploy tens of thou­sands of lo­cal peo­ple and gen­er­ate big amount of tax rev­enue and ex­port earn­ings for Zim­babwe. Take the Tianze to­bacco com­pany, as an ex­am­ple, it in­vested in Zim­babwe in 2005 when the Zim­bab­wean to­bacco in­dus­try was in deep re­ces­sion. It then went into contract with lo­cal farm­ers and also pur­chased to­bacco from the lo­cal auc­tion place. It is now the sin­gle big­gest buyer of Zim­babwe to­bacco, with the to­tal pur­chase ac­count­ing for half of the to­tal pro­duc­tion of Zim­bab­wean to­bacco. Last year, to­bacco pro­duc­tion hit a record high of over 240 000 kgs in his­tory and it is widely ac­cepted that the Chi­nese in­vest­ment con­trib­uted enor­mously to the re­cov­ery of the to­bacco in­dus­try. The Tianze Com­pany has 76 em­ploy­ees in to­tal, only 7 from China and the rest be­ing all Zim­bab­weans. Each year the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and com­pany pro­vides hun­dreds of gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ships and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­bab­wean out­stand­ing stu­dents and pro­fes­sional to study or im­prove in China. We have sent 16 batches of med­i­cal doc­tors to Zim­babwe since 1985. Now ten doc­tors are based in the Parireny­atwa Hos­pi­tal in Harare and each year they per­form 500 sur­gi­cal op­er­a­tions on av­er­age and treat hun­dreds of thou­sands of pa­tients of Zim­babwe. Re­cently, when Cy­clone Idai hit Zim­babwe, the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment is­sued an ur­gent ap­peal for help to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. China re­sponded with swift­ness and sin­cer­ity. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment im­me­di­ately do­nated US$800 000 cash to the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment and the Chi­nese com­mu­nity in Zim­babwe also in­stantly mo­bi­lized ma­te­rial sup­plies worth US$350,000 for the af­fected peo­ple. This year, we are go­ing to drill 500 bore­holes and do­nate 10 165 tonnes of rice to the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple. We hope our ef­forts will help Zim­bab­wean peo­ple to re­cover from the dis­as­ter and con­tinue on its path to a bet­ter fu­ture. Go­ing for­ward, China will con­tinue to en­hance China-Africa and China-Zim­babwe prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion as well as cul­tural and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes to take our re­la­tions to a higher level. We will en­cour­age more Chi­nese en­ter­prises to in­vest in Zim­babwe in ac­cor­dance with mar­ket rules to help Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. There is an African say­ing that reads, “walk alone if you want to go fast; and walk to­gether if you want to go far.” Let us join hands to bring more ben­e­fits to both Chi­nese and African peo­ple and to­gether make the world a bet­ter place to live. The Sec­ond Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive for In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion has been suc­cess­fully held in Bei­jing and a se­ries of co­op­er­a­tive mea­sures have been put in place. We strongly be­lieve that Zim­babwe and China will con­tinue to work to­gether un­der the frame­work of BRI and FOCAC to con­tin­u­ously push for­ward co­op­er­a­tion and raise bi­lat­eral re­la­tions to a higher level. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151203,Pres­i­dent in SA for China-Africa sum­mit,"PRES­I­DENT Robert Mu­gabe ar­rived here yes­ter­day evening to at­tend the sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) at the Sand­ton Con­ven­tion Cen­tre in Johannesburg, on Fri­day and Satur­day. He landed at the Waterk­loof Mil­i­tary Air­port in Pre­to­ria where he was wel­comed by South African In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter Faith Muthambi and Zim­babwe’s Am­bas­sador to South Africa Isaac Moyo. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe is ac­com­pa­nied by the min­is­ters of for­eign af­fairs, fi­nance and in­dus­try and commerce Sim­barashe Mum­bengegwi, Pa­trick Chi­na­masa and Mike Bimha re­spec­tively. The Pres­i­dent had ear­lier been seen off at the Harare In­ter­na­tional Air­port by the two Vice pres­i­dents Cdes Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko, min­is­ters, se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and ser­vice chiefs. The Johannesburg sum­mit, be­ing held un­der the theme, “China-Africa Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment,” comes fol­low­ing the con­clu­sion of a two day State visit to Zim­babwe by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping. The two coun­tries signed 12 land­mark agree­ments to fund vi­tal projects in key eco­nomic sec­tors. The sum­mit is the sec­ond in the 15 year history of FOCAC and the first on the African con­ti­nent af­ter the Beijing Sum­mit in 2006. In a state­ment last week ahead of his two day State visit to Zim­babwe, Pres­i­dent Xi said he looked for­ward to join­ing African lead­ers at the FOCAC Sum­mit, “and work­ing with them to ad­vance our friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion, lift China-Africa sol­i­dar­ity to a new high and build a bet­ter fu­ture for China-Africa friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Xi said con­sol­i­da­tion of re­la­tions with Zim­babwe and other African na­tions re­mained a cor­ner­stone of China’s for­eign pol­icy. “In con­duct­ing China's re­la­tions with Africa, we ad­here to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith and up­hold the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests,” said Pres­i­dent Xi. “We’ll work with Zim­babwe and all other friendly African na­tions to pave a broader and more solid road of mu­tual ben­e­fit and com­mon de­vel­op­ment for China and Africa.” Pres­i­dent Xi said China val­ues the im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to the sol­i­dar­ity and de­vel­op­ment of Africa that Zim­babwe has made af­ter Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe as­sumed the chair­man­ship of the African Union. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, over the past 15 years, the trade vol­ume be­tween China and Africa has soared from US$10 bil­lion to US$220 bil­lion. Dur­ing the same pe­riod, China’s direct in­vest­ment in Africa has sharply in­creased from US$500 mil­lion to US$30 bil­lion. There are over 3,000 Chi­nese com­pa­nies run­ning their busi­nesses in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent World Bank re­port, since the turn of the cen­tury, sub­Sa­ha­ran re­gion has main­tained ro­bust eco­nomic growth which would oth­er­wise be im­pos­si­ble with­out its eco­nomic ties with China Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to South Africa Tian Xue­jun was re­cently quoted in the me­dia say­ing, the sum­mit will fur­ther syn­er­gize China and Africa’s re­spec­tive de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. “Both China and Africa are at the cru­cial stage of de­vel­op­ment and have formulated am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. China has put for­ward the two cen­te­nary goals and the Fifth Ple­nary Ses­sion of the 18th Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee has pro­posed the 13th Five-Year Pro­gramme,” he said. “The African Union has adopted Agenda 2063 and its first Ten-Year Im­ple­men­ta­tion Plan. China and Africa are mov­ing for­ward in the same di­rec­tion. Dur­ing the up­com­ing sum­mit, lead­ers of China and Africa will gather i n South Africa to dis­cuss the ways to fur­ther align China and Africa’s de­vel­op­ment strate­gies and map out the new blueprint for China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion.” The Am­bas­sador said, dur­ing the sum­mit, China will an­nounce new mea­sures of co­op­er­a­tion with Africa for the next three years, “which is both a tra­di­tion and a defin­ing fea­ture of FOCAC.” “Th­ese new mea­sures will di­rectly serve the de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of both sides. Pri­or­i­ties will be given to ad­dress two ma­jor bot­tle­necks con­strain­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely the back­ward in­fra­struc­ture and the lack of pro­fes­sion­als,” he said. “More­over, China will fo­cus on is­sues con­cern­ing African peo­ple’s well­be­ing, like food, em­ploy­ment and health, and strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in such ma­jor ar­eas as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture build­ing, pub­lic health and poverty re­duc­tion, in­vest­ment and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, peo­pleto-peo­ple ex­changes, peace and se­cu­rity and green de­vel­op­ment.” Tian said China is the largest con­trib­u­tor of peace­keep­ers in Africa among all the per­ma­nent mem­bers of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. “As we speak, 90% of China’s over­seas peace­keep­ers are per­form­ing du­ties in Africa and the ac­cu­mu­lated num­ber has reached over 30,000. China also ac­tively en­gages in the in­ter­na­tional counter-piracy oper­a­tions in the Gulf of Aden and wa­ters off the So­mali coast. Up to now, China has sent 21 batches of all to­gether 60 ves­sels and es­corted over 6,000 ships,” he said. “China is ac­tively im­ple­ment­ing the “Ini­tia­tive on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tive Part­ner­ship for Peace and Se­cu­rity” and has pro­vided mil­i­tary and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to the AU for peace­keep­ing mis­sions in rel­e­vant coun­tries and the build­ing of the African Standby Force and the African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Cri­sis.” Pres­i­dent Xi an­nounced at the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly in Septem­ber that China will in the com­ing five years pro­vide free mil­i­tary aid of US$100 mil­lion to the African Union to sup­port the build­ing of the African Standby Force and the African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Cri­sis.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160310,Xi Jin­ping calls for in­dus­trial re­forms,"BEI­JING. — Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping on Mon­day called for deeper re­form to re­vi­talise China’s north-east­ern in­dus­trial base. He urged law­mak­ers from Hei­longjiang to pur­sue in­no­va­tive, co­or­di­nated, green, open and shared de­vel­op­ment when par­tic­i­pat­ing in de­lib­er­a­tions on the govern­ment work re­port at the fourth ses­sion of the 12th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress (NPC). He said that lo­cal govern­ment and party of­fi­cials must abide by the law as they im­ple­ment re­form poli­cies and that they should en­cour­age the pub­lic to do like­wise. Ca­pa­ble, hon­est of­fi­cials should be re­warded with pro­mo­tions, the pres­i­dent said. The meet­ing also dis­cussed the shift of eco­nomic en­gines, food prices, poverty re­lief and struc­tural re­form in in­dus­trial bases. In a panel dis­cus­sion with NPC deputies from Fu­jian Prov­ince, Premier Li Ke­qiang urged au­thori- ties of the east­ern coastal prov­ince to strengthen the green and mar­itime econ­omy and build a strate­gic pivot for coastal de­vel­op­ment. Li asked the prov­ince to speed up a shift in growth by boost­ing smart man­u­fac­tur­ing and the mod­ern ser­vice sec­tor and to take more ini­tia­tive in ad­vanc­ing re­form and open­ing up as well as the peace­ful de­vel­op­ment of cross-Strait re­la­tions. Join­ing deputies from An­hui Prov­ince in a group dis­cus­sion, Zhang De­jiang, chair­man of the NPC Stand­ing Com­mit­tee, said the new con­cept of in­no­va­tive, co­or­di­nated, green, open and shared de­vel­op­ment should be adopted to guide de­vel­op­ment and solve thorny prob­lems in the next five years and be­yond. In a panel dis­cus­sion with Tai­wan deputies, Yu Zheng­sheng, chair­man of the Chi­nese Peo­ple’s Political Con­sul­ta­tive Con­fer­ence Na­tional Com­mit­tee, said: “We will ad­here to the 1992 Con­sen­sus, res­o­lutely op­pose and con­tain any forms of ‘Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence’ sep­a­ratist ac­tiv­i­ties, strengthen con­tacts and ex­changes with all political par­ties and groups in Tai­wan that recog­nise the one-China prin­ci­ple.” Liu Yun­shan, mem­ber of the Stand­ing Com­mit­tee of the Political Bureau of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) Cen­tral Com­mit­tee, told NPC deputies from Sichuan Prov­ince in their panel dis­cus­sion, a clear un­der­stand­ing of the “new nor­mal” and work­ing with new de­vel­op­ment thoughts are es­sen­tial to en­sure the goals for the 13th Five-Year Plan pe­riod be met.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170719,Why African na­tions wel­come China,"AT A time when China’s growth is re­spon­si­ble for much of the world’s eco­nomic dy­namism, Western me­dia out­lets have taken to pub­lish­ing re­ports urg­ing cau­tion in the face of the coun­try’s ex­pand­ing in­flu­ence. These re­ports have crit­i­cised as ex­am­ples of neo-colo­nial­ism ini­tia­tives such as the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) — estab­lished in 2000 and the sym­bol of Chi­nese moves to­ward Africa — and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment in­volv­ing loans to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries un­der projects like the One Belt, One Road con­cept pro­posed in 2013. At the same time, the ex­pec­ta­tions of re­cip­i­ent coun­tries have surged in re­cent years. One fac­tor is the trans­for­ma­tion in the late 2000s of Africa from a “bas­ket case” be­set with AIDS, civil wars, poverty, and other prob­lems, to a “con­ti­nent of hope” en­joy­ing im­pres­sive rates of eco­nomic growth. African na­tions and, above all, their lead­ers, have come to see the re­la­tion­ship with China in a pos­i­tive light, as an engine for eco­nomic growth. Com­modi­ties prices have climbed with the ex­pan­sion of the Chi­nese econ­omy and this has bol­stered GDP in the African coun­tries of ori­gin since the 2000s. In 2009, China be­came the largest trad­ing part­ner of the African con­ti­nent, im­port­ing large quan­ti­ties of re­sources, and in­vest­ing huge sums in de­vel­op­ment. The rate of growth of the Chi­nese econ­omy has cer­tainly slowed over the past two or three years and im­ports from Africa have also been af­fected by the slump in in­ter­na­tional re­source prices. How­ever, the re­spect and con­fi­dence in China that has been built has not suf­fered. The in­fra­struc­ture that China has built in Africa is one of the main fac­tors for China’s pop­u­lar­ity in African na­tions. Amid the in­crease in new har­bours, roads, and air­ports, rail­ways in par­tic­u­lar have been a mas­sive bonus not only for the govern­ments of the coun­tries on the re­ceiv­ing end of loans, but also for the peo­ple of those coun­tries. With a his­tory of more than forty years, Chi­nese rail­way con­struc­tion in Africa dates back to the Tan­za­nia-Zam­bia Rail­way (TARAZA) in the early 1970s. Start­ing with the Ethiopia-Dji­bouti rail­way and ur­ban trans­porta­tion net­works in each coun­try, there are still now many projects un­der­way, build­ing in­ter­na­tional rail­road net­works link­ing the coun­tries in East Africa. These trains are not the high-speed TGV or bul­let train va­ri­ety. For land­locked na­tions, how­ever, rail fa­cil­i­tates the trans­port of a wide range of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and pri­mary re­sources to har­bours in a frac­tion of the time and in much large quan­ti­ties than was the case in the past. In ad­di­tion, the lo­cal rail­roads open up busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties for small mer­chants and farm­ers who have no means of trans­port. Cer­tainly, it may be the case that Chi­nese con­struc­tion com­pa­nies hardly ever use lo­cal labour, but bring en­gi­neers and work­ers with them from China. How­ever, the lines pro­vide sup­port for ev­ery­day life and this has left peo­ple with a pos­i­tive im­pres­sion. The rail­ways built dur­ing the colo­nial pe­riod were con­structed for the con­ve­nience of colo­nial en­trepreneurs, and most are in a state of dis­re­pair be­cause they were not main­tained af­ter in­de­pen­dence. Air­line routes in Africa of­ten con­nect ma­jor cities with the for­mer suzerain states, and Africans who want to visit a neigh­bour­ing coun­try may have to tran­sit via Europe. It is not likely that any­one draws com­par­isons be­tween air­planes and the cur­rent lo­cal train sys­tems as means of trans­port, but if ves­tiges of Euro­cen­trism linger even in the air­line routes, it is not dif­fi­cult to imag­ine that Africans would wel­come Chi­nese busi­ness cap­i­tal build­ing in­fra­struc­ture for lo­cal peo­ple. Per­son­ally, I be­lieve that re­spect for China also in­cludes el­e­ments of “as­pir­ing to­wards the de­vel­op­men­tal state.” Al­though China is still a de­vel­op­ing na­tion, a strong (in fact, au­thor­i­tar­ian) state has built an econ­omy that guar­an­tees the lives of its cit­i­zens, win­ning recog­ni­tion for its suc­cess, and per­haps this has given peo­ple hope. It is hardly sur­pris­ing that the “de­vel­op­men­tal state,” which links na­tional in­te­gra­tion with eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, is one of the ideals for lead­ers of coun­tries that were not eas­ily able to de­liver on talk of na­tional uni­fi­ca­tion at the time of their in­de­pen­dence. We might note here that the ori­gins of the de­scrip­tion of the de­vel­op­men­tal state are found in Ja­pan. Of course, African coun­tries also wel­come in­vest­ment from Ja­pan. As long as in­vest­ments pro­vide busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties, Africans be­lieve it is bet­ter to deal with the real prob­lems of hav­ing lots of op­tions. From the Chi­nese per­spec­tive, the African con­ti­nent is the last stop for the One Belt, One Road con­cept. Since the eco­nomic re­forms in 1979 and the emer­gence of the con­cept of the “so­cial­ist mar­ket econ­omy” in the 1990s, the mar­ket (read: de­mand) has become the es­sen­tial growth fac­tor for the econ­omy in China. The One Belt, One Road is a struc­ture that will gen­er­ate new de­mand to counter the ex­cess sup­ply ca­pac­ity of the Chi­nese econ­omy. Even if the loans become un­col­lectable, China does not need to re­coup its cap­i­tal out­lays at this stage. Min­ing rights for nat­u­ral re­sources, har­bour leases, and other set­tle­ments in kind are far more use­ful to the fu­ture of the Chi­nese econ­omy. Even if such “good­ies” are aban­doned, China can score a sig­nif­i­cant win in the long term if it can form a ren­minbi eco­nomic zone and pro­vide the ground­work for build­ing a world where in­ter­na­tional trade does not rely on the US dol­lar. To make this eco­nomic zone a more com­fort­able place for ev­ery­one, it is cru­cial to start ef­forts early to get the mes­sage across to China that a uni­lat­eral hege­mony is not a good pol­icy for Pax Sinica. — www.thediplo­mat.com.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20161009,Africa should in­vest in min­er­als that di­rectly bring de­vel­op­ment,"AFRICA should in­vest on min­er­als that di­rectly solve poverty is­sues that the peo­ple are fac­ing in­stead of con­cen­trat­ing on ex­otic min­er­als, an of­fi­cial said. South­ern Africa Re­source Watch ( SARW) di­rec­tor Mr Claude Kabe­mba told Sun­day Busi­ness that African coun­tries must con­cen­trate on the min­er­als that deal with the fun­da­men­tals of the prob­lems that peo­ple are fac­ing like hous­ing, en­ergy and food se­cu­rity. SARW is a re­gional body that mon­i­tors cor­po­rate and state con­duct in the ex­trac­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of nat­u­ral re­sources in South­ern Africa re­gion, in par­tic­u­lar as­sess­ing to what ex­tent these ef­forts con­trib­ute to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. “When you look at the min­er­als that di­rectly solve the prob­lems of the peo­ple it is not gold, plat­inum or di­a­monds, we are talk­ing about ce­ment, quarry, fos­sil fuel, coal and phos­phate for agri­cul­ture,” said Mr Kabe­mba. In­or­ganic phos­phates are mined to ob­tain phos­pho­rus for use in agri­cul­ture and in­dus­try. It is used in fer­tiliser pro­duc­tion. Mr Kabe­mba said Africa was fac­ing a chal­lenge to take its peo­ple out of poverty and that the crit­i­cal ar­eas which the gov­ern­ments must fo­cus on are shel­ter, en­ergy and food se­cu­rity. He said in­vest­ing in ce­ment will bring down its prices and more peo­ple would be able to build houses. Mr Kabe­mba also said that Zim­babwe has cop­per which is vi­tal in the de­vel­op­ment of the en­ergy sec­tor in the con­ti­nent, but the coun­try was not min­ing it that much. “As Africa we need to iden­tify strate­gic min­er­als if we are go­ing to deal with poverty in a sus­tain­able way. Gold and di­a­monds are im­por­tant min­er­als which give us a lot of money but they do not di­rectly solve the prob­lem that we face as Africa,” said Mr Kabe­mba. He, how­ever, said that other min­er­als were also im­por­tant but Africa was to work on adding value on them. “Zim­babwe has di­a­monds and if they sell that di­a­mond di­rectly from Chi­adzwa it would be 20 times less in value than a stone that is pol­ished. So what we are say­ing is, why don’t we add value a bit. It will also cre­ate jobs,” Mr Kabe­mba said. Ac­cord­ing to the Min­er­als Mar­ket­ing Cor­po­ra­tion of Zim­babwe, the Gov­ern­ment is invit­ing prospec­tive di­a­mond cut­ting and pol­ish­ing firms in a move aimed at adding value to Zim­bab­wean di­a­monds and cre­at­ing jobs for in­dige­nous peo­ple. A team of Zim­bab­weans is also in China learn­ing di­a­mond pol­ish­ing as a plant to value add the min­eral has been set up in Harare. Mr Kabe­mba said when Africa ex­ports raw ma­te­ri­als it was also ex­port­ing jobs. “The thing is as Zim­babwe you can­not do it alone but if we come to­gether as a re­gion, we have what we call pro­ducer power. Take Zim­babwe, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, all pro­duc­ing di­a­monds. As pro­duc­ers we can come to­gether and cre­ate a mar­ket, those that want our di­a­monds can come here, why should our di­a­monds be sold in Bel­gium and Is­rael,” he said. “Bel­gium An­twerp, have you been there, they have mas­sive of­fices where a lot of money is made, but it is from trad­ing di­a­monds from our coun­tries,” Mr Kabe­mba said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200531,Shared vi­sion needed to turn­around Zim,"WE need a com­mon vi­sion an­chored on self-be­lief, unity of pur­pose and a de­sire to mi­grate to a new era of shared growth and pros­per­ity and end­ing in­equal­i­ties and poverty. Zim­babwe can­not achieve Vi­sion 2030 with­out all of us buy­ing into this pro­gres­sive na­tional vi­sion — from the coun­try’s lead­er­ship to the or­di­nary man and woman across the coun­try. For Zim­babwe to achieve Vi­sion 2030, bedrocked on at­tain­ment of an up­per mid­dle-class econ­omy as pro­pounded by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, it needs vi­sion­ary lead­er­ship in all sec­tors — be it pol­i­tics, busi­ness, civic so­ci­ety, com­mu­nity, re­li­gious sec­tor, tra­di­tional lead­ers, sport and so on. We need a lead­er­ship across the nation that is ded­i­cated, self­less, ac­count­able, dis­ci­plined, in­no­va­tive and re­sults ori­ented. We need a ser­vant lead­er­ship that is will­ing to un­con­di­tion­ally serve its peo­ple and trans­form our beloved coun­try into pros­per­ity. Re­source base Zim­babwe has a strong re­source base, which is a “good head start” and strong lever­age to build a rich and prosperous coun­try. God has blessed Zim­babwe with abun­dant re­sources, some of which are men­tioned be­low: ◆ Min­er­als: forty (40) dif­fer­ent types of min­er­als. Zim­babwe has one of the rich­est di­a­mond de­posits in the world, sec­ond largest plat­inum re­serves (af­ter South Africa) and sig­nif­i­cant de­posits of gold, chrome, nickel, coal and nat­u­ral gas, among oth­ers. ◆ Hu­man cap­i­tal: a pop­u­la­tion with a high lit­er­acy rate of 95 per­cent, cou­pled with a strong ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem that pro­vides skilled hu­man cap­i­tal needed for driv­ing eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. ◆ Wildlife: abun­dant wildlife re­sources, which in­clude the big five (lion, ele­phant, rhinoceros, buf­falo and leop­ard), nat­u­ral won­ders (Vic­to­ria Falls, Nyanga, Vumba). ◆ Cli­mate: good and pre­dictable cli­mate. ◆ Land: 10 490 square kilo­me­tres of arable land suitable for com­mer­cial agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. ◆ Land Re­form: pro­gramme suc­cess­fully ad­dressed the skewed colo­nial land ten­ure sys­tem through trans­fer of land to the in­dige­nous peo­ple thereby se­cur­ing the peo­ple ac­cess and con­trol of the key re­source and means of pro­duc­tion. ◆ Indi­geni­sa­tion: black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment pol­icy ( if prop­erly ap­plied) lays the foun­da­tion for cre­ation of an in­clu­sive econ­omy that em­pow­ers and en­ables all peo­ple to par­tic­i­pate/play an ac­tive role in eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. ◆ Di­as­pora: Zim­babwe’s di­as­pora pop­u­la­tion is es­ti­mated be­tween 2,5 and 3,5 mil­lion which is ca­pa­ble of pro­vid­ing enor­mous fi­nan­cial and hu­man cap­i­tal re­sources and net­works for the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try. ◆ Con­sti­tu­tion: a pro­gres­sive Con­sti­tu­tion based on equal­ity of all peo­ple and safe­guard­ing of hu­man rights for all Zim­bab­weans. ◆ Peace: a peace loving, hard­work­ing and com­pet­i­tive peo­ple by na­ture. Blame game De­spite these abun­dant re­sources, why do we find our­selves fac­ing eco­nomic and so­cial hard­ships we are cur­rently ex­pe­ri­enc­ing? The coun­try has suf­fi­cient nat­u­ral and hu­man re­sources needed to cre­ate a vi­brant in­clu­sive econ­omy that can up­lift the liv­ing stan­dards of all its peo­ple in line with the Pres­i­dent’s blue­print, Vi­sion 2030. Why we are fail­ing to cre­ate this vi­brant in­clu­sive econ­omy that we all want is be­cause we are deeply di­vided as a nation and not shar­ing a com­mon vi­sion. The po­lar­i­sa­tion in our pol­i­tics and so­ci­ety is drag­ging us back­wards as a nation. We are also suf­fer­ing from a blame game syn­drome which we de­lib­er­ately in­flicted on our­selves as a nation. We are quick and good at blam­ing some­thing for our own fail­ures — we even blame As the plat­form will be tai­lor-made to ac­com­mo­date virtual meet­ings, it is en­vis­aged that it will pro­vide an al­ter­na­tive ac­cess to mar­kets where phys­i­cal trade fairs and ex­hi­bi­tions have been sus­pended. It is highly rec­om­mended that Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies par­tic­i­pate in on­line ex­hi­bi­tions and trade fairs, as this will en­sure they re­main in touch with in­ter­na­tional buy­ers in this new nor­mal. Covid-19 has made it pos­si­ble for us to re­alise that “dis­tance is past” and the new nor­mal is that events can take place re­motely. There are sev­eral ad­van­tages that make virtual ex­hi­bi­tions an ideal so­lu­tion dur­ing this pe­riod, which in­clude re­duced cost of prepa­ra­tion and par­tic­i­pa­tion. While the fu­ture is un­cer­tain, with re­duced phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion likely go­ing to be the “new nor­mal” through­out this year, it is im­por­tant for lo­cal com­pa­nies to iden­tify trade fairs and ex­hi­bi­tions that have been mi­grated to virtual plat­forms and es­tab­lish which ones will in­crease their global mar­ket share. Prior un­der­stand­ing of these virtual events will en­sure that par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies put their time and, in some cases, fi­nan­cial re­sources to good use. Be­low are some ex­am­ples of events that have adopted a virtual com­po­nent to aug­ment ef­forts that are tar­geted at improving en­gage­ments be­tween sell­ers and buy­ers. In­tra-African Trade Fair The sec­ond con­ti­nent-wide trade fair was sched­uled to take place from Septem­ber 1 to 7 this year in Ki­gali, Rwanda. How­ever, or­gan­is­ers of the In­tra-African Trade Fair (IATF) post­poned the event to Septem­ber 6 to 12, 2021. Sec­tors that were ear­marked to ben­e­fit from the event in­clude hor­ti­cul­ture, pro­cessed foods, agri­cul­tural in­puts and im­ple­ments, in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies, engi­neer­ing, arts and crafts, min­ing sup­plies, cloth­ing and tex­tiles, as well as leather and leather prod­ucts. Given the en­thu­si­asm that had been gen­er­ated, an all year-round dig­i­tal net­work­ing plat­form was es­tab­lished to con­nect buy­ers and sell­ers. The virtual trade fair is ex­pected to take place all year round and a virtual booth costs around US$750/year. Dur­ing the in­au­gu­ral IATF, which took place in 2018 in Egypt, more than 25 Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies par­tic­i­pated. Par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies were drawn from arts and crafts, cloth­ing and tex­tiles, pro­cessed foods, leather and leather prod­ucts, agri­cul­tural in­puts and im­ple­ments, finance, cor­po­rate advisory ser­vices and FMCG (fast-mov­ing con­sumer goods) sec­tors. Dur­ing the 2018 fair, par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies recorded 461 busi­ness leads and or­ders worth around US$2,4 mil­lion. The ob­jec­tive of par­tic­i­pat­ing in 2018, the moon and the stars. Yes, ex­ter­nal fac­tors have a bear­ing to prob­lems that we are en­coun­ter­ing as a nation, but the blame game will not take us any­where. As Zim­bab­weans we should not be known as a nation of whin­ers — whin­ing and point­ing fin­gers on oth­ers for our short­com­ings in­stead of get­ting up, dust­ing our­selves up and work­ing tire­lessly for the com­mon good of this great coun­try and for the ben­e­fit of fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. It is painful to ac­cept this about our­selves but if we are hon­est, these ob­ser­va­tions can­not be de­nied. There is a Sotho proverb that goes: “The child of a crab walks side­ways like his/her mother.” If we con­tinue with the blame game cul­ture, we risk pass­ing it to our chil­dren and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, with dis­as­trous out­comes to the de­vel­op­ment and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion of our great coun­try. His­tory is full of ex­am­ples of other coun­tries, who faced sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions and prob­lems like ours, but were able to put aside their dif­fer­ences, unite and work to­wards a com­mon goal of de­vel­op­ing their coun­tries, cre­at­ing jobs and wealth and up­lift­ing peo­ple from poverty. Un­til as a nation we self-in­tro­spect and which can still be re­alised through virtual en­gage­ments, was to mar­ket Zim­babwe’s trade and in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, gen­er­ate ex­port or­ders for the coun­try and pro­mote Zim­babwe as a source mar­ket as well as to pro­mote the coun­try as a pre­ferred in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion. DRC Min­ing Week This is the largest min­ing and in­dus­trial plat­form in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo (DRC), bring­ing to­gether stake­hold­ers and in­ter­ested busi­nesses from more than 50 coun­tries. Par­tic­i­pants’ ob­jec­tive is to show­case their prod­ucts and ser­vices as well as ex­plore the vast in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the coun­try. The min­ing sec­tor in the DRC is one of the largest an­chors of the econ­omy, sup­port­ing an ar­ray of main­stream and down­stream eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties. To sup­port min­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, the DRC im­ported min­ing sup­plies worth around US$288 mil­lion in 2019, ac­cord­ing to Trade Map. The im­ported sup­plies in 2019, which in­clude ap­pli­ances for pipes, boiler shells, tanks, pro­tec­tive footwear and cloth­ing, bor­ing or sink­ing ma­chin­ery and parts, and buck­ets, shov­els, grabs and grips for ma­chin­ery, pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies. Pre­vi­ously, par­tic­i­pat­ing Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies were able to in­ter­act with man­u­fac­tur­ers, distrib­u­tors and re­tail­ers in the min­ing sec­tor, re­sult­ing in in­creased sales of their prod­ucts and sales. As a re­sult of par­tic­i­pat­ing in this event, one pro­tec­tive cloth­ing com­pany was able to es­tab­lish a branch in Lubum­bashi. The phys­i­cal event had been sched­uled for June 17 to 19, 2020 but has been post­poned to Oc­to­ber 7 to 9, 2020. To keep con­ver­sa­tions go­ing and im­prove busi­ness link­ages, the or­gan­is­ers have or­gan­ised a se­ries of virtual sem­i­nars, which will take place on orig­i­nal dates un­til Septem­ber. These sem­i­nars will pro­vide a plat­form for lo­cal com­pa­nies to es­tab­lish ini­tial con­tact with po­ten­tial buy­ers who are ex­pected to par­tic­i­pate. They will also form the ba­sis for fur­ther in­ter­ac­tions dur­ing the phys­i­cal event in Oc­to­ber. Caminex Caminex is Zam­bia’s min­ing, agri­cul­tural and in­dus­trial trade expo, which is po­si­tioned to in­crease the pres­ence of Zim­bab­wean prod­ucts and ser­vices into the coun­try’s min­ing sec­tor. Ac­cord­ing to Trade Map, Zam­bia’s im­port bill for min­ing sup­plies in 2019 was around US$333 mil­lion, with the largest sup­pli­ers be­ing South Africa, Ja­pan, China and India. Given Zim­babwe’s prox­im­ity to Zam­bia, there is room to in­crease the con­tri­bu­tion take re­spon­si­bil­ity or our own ac­tions, we will re­main stuck in the trenches of un­der­de­vel­op­ment, in­equal­ity and poverty and fail to cre­ate the Zim­babwe we all want in line with Vi­sion 2030. Out­look We should not be stuck in the past, rather we should learn from it and use it as a com­pass that guides us on how we can over­come past and cur­rent chal­lenges and move our nation for­ward. We should look in­wards to mo­bilise Zim­bab­wean re­sources that we al­ready have, at home and in the Di­as­pora, to finance and ac­cel­er­ate our eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and de­vel­op­ment agenda in line with Vi­sion 2030. When the go­ing gets tough many Zim­bab­weans are heard say­ing “kiya kiya” — loosely trans­lated to mean — “im­pro­vise or make do with what is there”. This idea of set­tling for sec­ond best should be dis­carded. Fel­low Zim­bab­weans, we de­serve the best and should in­sist for the best — qual­ity, per­fec­tion, ex­cel­lence, higher stan­dards, good liv­ing, hap­pi­ness and joy, not poverty. of lo­cal com­pa­nies to Zam­bia’s min­ing sup­plies im­port bill. The min­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in Zam­bia’s Cop­per­belt re­gion pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cal com­pa­nies that can sup­ply prod­ucts such as safety cloth­ing, fast mov­ing con­sumer goods, iron and steel prod­ucts, elec­tric trans­form­ers, pumps for liq­uids, silo main­te­nance and clean­ing ser­vices, fruits and veg­eta­bles, and pro­cessed foods. Last year, nine com­pa­nies that man­u­fac­ture prod­ucts for the mines, such as engi­neer­ing prod­ucts, pro­tec­tive cloth­ing and elec­tri­cal and se­cu­rity prod­ucts, par­tic­i­pated and show­cased their prod­ucts at this event. Dur­ing the three-day event last year, a to­tal of 715 busi­ness leads and or­ders worth over US$400 000 were recorded by par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies. This year’s event that was sched­uled to take place from June 2 to 4 was post­poned to the same month next year. To cover the gap, ZimTrade is or­gan­is­ing a virtual event for sec­tor play­ers that will be held later this year. Plans are also in place to in­clude other sec­tor play­ers in the event so that it cov­ers more prod­ucts and ser­vices that Zim­bab­wean busi­nesses can sup­ply to Zam­bia. Asia Pa­cific Leather Fair The edi­tion of the Asia Pa­cific Leather Fair (APLF) — Leather, Ma­te­ri­als+ and Fash­ion Ac­cess show, which was ini­tially sched­uled for March 31 to April 2 this year, was post­poned to March 30 to April 1, 2021. The APLF is a global trade ex­hi­bi­tion cover­ing the leather sup­ply chain from raw, crust, to fin­ished leathers, chem­i­cals, dyes and tan­ning. It can pro­vide ac­cess for lo­cal com­pa­nies into the high im­port bill of leather in Asia. Ac­cord­ing to Trade Map, the Asian con­ti­nent im­ported leather and leather prod­ucts worth around US$59 bil­lion in 2019. Top im­porters in Asia, which Zim­babwe en­joys cor­dial re­la­tions with in­clude China, Ja­pan, Singapore, Korea and United Arab Emi­rates. On the other hand, the Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co-oper­a­tion (APEC) im­ported leather and leather prod­ucts worth around US$104 bil­lion in 2019 alone. To sup­port the in­dus­try on main­tain­ing their busi­nesses and stay­ing con­nected with the com­mu­nity dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod, APLF launched the In­Touch ini­tia­tive in April this year. In­Touch is a virtual sourc­ing event dur­ing which sup­pli­ers present their prod­ucts live in front of viewer’s screen. Each one hour In­Touch event is cu­rated to suit dif­fer­ent sourc­ing re­quire­ments of buy­ers and pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties for “ques­tion and an­swer” ses­sions, which are key in de­vel­op­ing ex­port mar­kets.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20201004,"Of hunger, poverty and zoono­sis in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries","Agroup of poul­try ven­dors jos­tle to mar­ket their prod­ucts to cus­tomers, in com­plete de­fi­ance of gov­ern­ment’s rec­om­men­da­tion to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing and curb the spread of Covid-19. Lo­cated on the road­side, a live­stock mar­ket that sits op­po­site the en­trance to gi­ant poul­try com­pany — Irvines — is one of many dot­ted across Ho­p­ley Farm, on the out­skirts of Harare. The sell­ing of live chicken, mainly sourced from Irvines, is brisk business as other pro­tein al­ter­na­tives like pork and beef have be­come too ex­pen­sive for most fam­i­lies. How­ever, these ef­forts come with a risk of ex­po­sure to zoonotic dis­eases in the largely un­reg­u­lated poul­try sup­ply chains. Sit­ting at one of the makeshift stalls, back­yard poul­try breeder Ben Chauke is ec­static that his stock is al­most sold out by mid­day. “This is my only source of liveli­hood and on days when I get prof­its like this, it is enough for me and my fam­ily,” he told The Stan­dard. His ex­cite­ment goes be­yond the fact that stock has sold well, but that it hap­pened with­out him hav­ing had to fork out a for­tune on costs for vac­ci­na­tion and other med­i­ca­tion. “A poul­try business is good ex­cept when chick­ens get sick with var­i­ous types of dis­eases that can claim up to 40 from a group of 100 chick­ens un­less we in­vest well into med­i­ca­tion,” said Chauke. “It also usu­ally de­pends on how well one cleans the hen house and whether they are get­ting enough heat or not be­cause they need care and pro­tec­tion sim­i­lar to that of hu­mans.” Small-scale farm­ers like Chauke are gam­blers when it comes to an­i­mal health yet the lit­tle space they have for breed­ing com­pro­mises on hy­giene, lead­ing to a very high risk of dis­ease spread. Bangladeshi vi­rol­o­gist Rok­shana Parvin, who has been con­duct­ing re­search on avian in­fluenza in her coun­try for over a decade, says the mis­han­dling of live­stock in in­for­mal mar­kets is a se­ri­ous threat to food sup­ply in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. “In­fec­tious dis­eases, es­pe­cially, vi­ral dis­eases among live­stock are a ma­jor threat to global an­i­mal health and wel­fare so their ef­fec­tive con­trol is cru­cial for agro­nomic health, safe­guard­ing and se­cur­ing na­tional and in­ter­na­tional food sup­plies as well as al­le­vi­at­ing poverty,” says Parvin. Ac­cord­ing to her, avian in­fluenza viruses are now en­demic in many parts of the world and “threats from old and new pathogens con­tinue to emerge” with changes to global cli­mate, agri­cul­tural prac­tices and de­mog­ra­phy pre­sent­ing con­di­tions favourable for the spread. This is enough rea­son to al­ways keep up­date on cir­cu­lat­ing viruses in any coun­try to avoid the spike of dis­ease to pan­demic lev­els she says: “That [con­stant re­search] would fur­ther help the so­ci­ety or com­mu­nity to get alert from the emer­gence of new pre-pan­demic strain of the virus.” Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Live­stock Re­search In­sti­tute, zoonotic dis­eases trans­mis­si­ble ei­ther di­rectly or in­di­rectly be­tween an­i­mals and hu­mans are re­spon­si­ble for more than 2,4 bil­lion cases of hu­man ill­ness and 2,2 mil­lion deaths per year. The ef­fects are grim­mer in poor com­mu­ni­ties like most of Bangladesh and Zim­babwe where peo­ple have lit­tle nu­tri­tional op­tions and de­pend on un­safe sources like back­yard-bred poul­try for pro­tein. “Peo­ple have to be ed­u­cated on how to take good care of their an­i­mals and buy­ing from rep­utable sources be­cause zoonotic dis­eases are un­der-re­ported lo­cally,” a lo­cal vet­eri­nar­ian who pre­ferred anonymity said. With­out full knowl­edge on an­i­mal health, the coun­try’s dis­as­ter pre­pared­ness is com­pro­mised and the con­se­quences could be far-reach­ing. “If we are not tak­ing enough care of our an­i­mals, it means if there is any prob­lem within the an­i­mal health sys­tem it will also af­fect hu­mans as they con­sume these prod­ucts,” said the ex­pert. “Also, be­ing an im­porter of live­stock if we do not do re­search to check for zoonotic dis­eases in what is com­ing in, it be­comes a big pub­lic health cri­sis.” In 2017, the coun­try bat­tled with the highly con­ta­gious H5N8 bird flu which trig­gered im­port bans from other coun­tries in South­ern Africa, weigh­ing heav­ily on lo­cal pro­duc­ers. But, un­fet­tered sale of chick­ens con­tin­ued within Zim­babwe’s bor­ders al­though sub­sis­tence pro­duc­ers con­tinue to report that their chick­ens be­ing wiped out by uniden­ti­fied bugs. “A per­son can never get flu from a chicken, but the op­po­site could be true” says Chauke sar­cas­ti­cally. Back­yard breed­ers like him some­times slaugh­ter sick chick­ens and sell the pieces to avert losses, a phe­nom­e­non he par­tially con­firmed. “There are some cus­tomers who can ap­proach me say­ing they want the dy­ing chick­ens, at a lower price of course, and there is no way I would refuse that and make a loss,” he re­vealed. Iron­i­cally, the fear of zoonotic dis­ease spread is more real now more than ever as a re­sult of re­ports claim­ing that Covid-19 emerged from bat consumption in China. In­ves­ti­ga­tions show that avian in­fluenza H5N1 strain (bird flu) is al­ready en­demic in many coun­tries in the world, caus­ing hu­man in­fec­tions and death. “It is very much con­cern among the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity, that fur­ther mu­ta­tion and re­as­sort­ment events within the cir­cu­lat­ing H5N1 virus may lead to emer­gence of a new pan­demic strain that could kill more hu­man lives,” said Parvin. For a coun­try like Zim­babwe con­duct­ing lit­tle to no re­search ow­ing to re­source con­straints, these dan­gers are more pro­nounced and com­pounded by hunger, as half the pop­u­la­tion was ear­lier this year pro­jected to starve this year alone ac­cord­ing to the World Food Pro­gramme. How­ever, there is still ur­gent need for re­search and re­lat­able ways of com­mu­ni­cat­ing how healthy rear­ing ways of the poul­try could min­imise or limit dis­ease out­break says Parvin. “We never should ap­proach the com­mu­nity say­ing ‘do not eat chicken or duck, they trans­mit dis­ease’,” she sug­gests. “It will give a neg­a­tive im­pres­sion to the un­der­priv­i­leged so­ci­eties or less ed­u­cated com­mu­nity, rather we should mo­ti­vate them to use ba­sic hy­gienic and sani­ti­sa­tion meth­ods in the com­mu­nity.” Whether small-scale poul­try farm­ers like Chauke or their cus­tomers choose to view the sci­en­tific rev­e­la­tions with the im­por­tance they so­licit re­mains a mys­tery, but turn­ing a blind eye could be tragic in the fu­ture.",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20210312,He is one of the rich­est celebri­ties in the world,"WHO are the rich­est celebri­ties in the world? Madonna, Paul McCart­ney, Oprah . . . now maybe Kanye West???!!! You'll def­i­nitely recog­nise every name on this list of in­cred­i­bly wealthy celebri­ties, but their ac­tual net worth for­tunes will raise some eye­brows. The min­i­mum net worth re­quired to be one of the rich­est celebri­ties on the planet this year was US$600 mil­lion. Be­lieve it or not, there are TWELVE celebrity bil­lion­aires in the world to­day. Be­fore we dive into this list of the top 30-rich­est celebs, a quick clar­i­fi­ca­tion/point of con­sid­er­a­tion — We very re­cently pub­lished a list of the rich­est ath­letes in the world. With a net worth of US$2,2 bil­lion, Michael Jor­dan took the crown. Should Michael Jor­dan ALSO be con­sid­ered a “celebrity?” We ended up de­cid­ing YES. He and one other ath­lete is in­cluded on this list for two rea­sons: 1) They both earned the vast, vast, vast ma­jor­ity of their for­tunes out­side of their re­spec­tive sports, and 2) They are both ar­guably both more fa­mous over the last decade for their non-ath­letic ac­com­plish­ments. So let's get down to busi­ness. Show busi­ness. Be­low is our list . . . #15: Madonna net worth: US$850m Madonna is a singer and ac­tress with a net worth of around US$850 mil­lion. Ris­ing to promi­nence in the early 80s, Madonna's bound­ary-push­ing per­son­al­ity kept her at the top of the charts through the 90s and 2000s. Along with her mu­sic, she has made an im­pact at the box of­fice as well. Her film roles in­clude “Des­per­ately Seek­ing Su­san”, “A League of Their Own”, and “Evita”, the lat­ter win­ning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Ac­tress. Madonna con­tin­ues to re­lease mu­sic and is still a top-earn­ing live act. #14: Herb Alpert net worth: US$850m Herb Alpert is an Amer­i­can mu­si­cian and en­tre­pre­neur with an es­ti­mated net worth of US$850 mil­lion. He is pri­mar­ily known for his in­cred­i­bly suc­cess­ful record­ing ca­reer with Herb Alpert & the Ti­juana Brass, a group that has sold more than 75 mil­lion records world­wide. How­ever, much of Alpert's for­tune came from the cre­ation and even­tual sale of the record la­bel A&M Records. The la­bel sported a ros­ter of wildly popular artists and spawned many top records. The sale gen­er­ated hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars for Alpert and his busi­ness part­ner, Jerry Moss. #13: P Diddy net worth: US$885 mil­lion Born Sean Combs, P Diddy is a rap­per, en­tre­pre­neur, and de­signer whose net worth stands around US$885 mil­lion. Af­ter get­ting fired from an in­tern­ship at a New York record la­bel, Combs set up his own la­bel, Bad Boy En­ter­tain­ment. One of the la­bel's first suc­cess­ful artists was The No­to­ri­ous B.I.G., though they would go on to work with a number of top artists of the era. Along with his la­bel, Combs has been a popular record­ing artiste him­self, earn­ing a number of hits and sell­ing mil­lions of al­bums. His busi­ness in­ter­ests have also fur­thered his wealth, in­clud­ing the cre­ation of cloth­ing la­bel “Sean Jean” and vodka brand Ciroc. #12: Jerry Se­in­feld net worth: US$950 mil­lion Jerry Se­in­feld is an ac­tor, writer, and co­me­dian known for cre­at­ing one of the most popular sit­coms of all time, Se­in­feld. Jerry Se­in­feld be­gan his ca­reer in com­edy soon af­ter col­lege, work­ing re­lent­lessly to build up a fan base and fur­ther his ca­reer. In 1981, a suc­cess­ful ap­pear­ance on Johnny Car­son's Tonight Show bol­stered his im­age and led to a number of other late night per­for­mances. How­ever, it was the cre­ation of Se­in­feld along­side co-cre­ator Larry David that led to Se­in­feld's big­gest suc­cess. Even af­ter the show's hey­day, it con­tin­ues to yield healthy re­turns for both Se­in­feld and David. #11: JK Rowl­ing net worth: US$1 bil­lion JK Rowl­ing is an au­thor, screen­writer, and phi­lan­thropist known pri­mar­ily for cre­at­ing the Harry Pot­ter fran­chise. Ris­ing up from poverty as a sin­gle mother, JK Rowl­ing has since amassed one of the great­est lit­er­ary for­tunes in his­tory. The se­ries of Harry Pot­ter books she cre­ated was noth­ing short of a world­wide phe­nom­e­non that sparked theme park at­trac­tions, films, and a spin-off fran­chise. She is renowned for her char­i­ta­ble giv­ing, known to have do­nated at least US$150 mil­lion to date. #10: Jay-Z net worth: US$1 bil­lion Jay-Z is an Amer­i­can rap­per, en­tre­pre­neur, and mu­sic mogul with an es­ti­mated net worth of US$1 bil­lion. Born Shawn Carter in Brook­lyn, New York, Jay-Z rose from his drug-deal­ing past to es­tab­lish him­self as one of the big­gest rap­pers of the era, sell­ing more than 100 mil­lion records. Jay-Z co-founded the record la­bel Roc-A-Fella Records, a suc­cess­ful com­pany that was even­tu­ally nested un­der Def Jam Records. Through a se­ries of smart busi­ness de­ci­sions, Jay-Z has man­aged to re­tain rights to his mu­sic, a major fac­tor in his con­tin­u­ally grow­ing net worth. In 2008, he mar­ried singer Bey­once. #9: David Cop­per­field net worth: US$1 bil­lion Born David Seth Kotkin, David Cop­per­field gained promi­nence as Amer­ica's fore­most il­lu­sion­ist. Gar­ner­ing fame for such tricks as mak­ing the Statue of Lib­erty dis­ap­pear and walk­ing through the Great Wall of China, Cop­per­field's tele­vised il­lu­sions and stage per­for­mances have en­thralled mil­lions and gained him a number of awards. Cop­per­field also owns a col­lec­tion of rare magic mem­o­ra­bilia es­ti­mated by some to be worth as much as US$500 mil­lion. #8: Paul McCart­ney net worth: US$1,2 bil­lion Writer of some of the world's most fa­mous songs, Paul McCart­ney has en­joyed suc­cess as a found­ing mem­ber of The Bea­tles and suc­cess­ful solo artiste. One half of the song-writ­ing duo of Lennon and McCart­ney, his con­tri­bu­tions to The Bea­tles suc­cess spawned many of their most popular songs. Even af­ter The Bea­tles broke up in 1970, McCart­ney con­tin­ued to top the mu­sic charts with hit al­bums and world­wide tours. #7: Michael Jor­dan net worth: US$2,2 bil­lion Michael Jor­dan's US$2,2 bil­lion net worth makes him the rich­est ath­lete in the world. De­spite be­ing the great­est bas­ket­ball player ever, he did not ac­tu­ally earn that much money from NBA salaries. In to­tal he earned around US$94 mil­lion in NBA salaries. So how did he earn his for­tune? Two ways: 1) To date, Michael has earned more than US$1,6 bil­lion from en­dorse­ments, most no­tably from Nike and Ga­torade. The re­main­der of his net worth came thanks to a savvy in­vest­ment in the NBA's Char­lotte Hornets. He is the ma­jor­ity owner, buy­ing in for the first time in 2006 at a rock bot­tom price. In 2019 he sold a 20 per­cent stake in the team to a group of in­vestors at a val­u­a­tion of US$1,5 bil­lion. #6: Jami Gertz net worth: US$3 bil­lion Jami Gertz is an ac­tress, phi­lan­thropist, and sports team owner who is worth around US$3 bil­lion. The bulk of Gertz's worth came about due to her mar­riage to bil­lion­aire Tony Ressler, the co-founder of Ares Man­age­ment. Gertz and Ressler have own­er­ship stakes in the At­lanta Hawks and Mil­wau­kee Brewers. While still an ac­tor, Gertz is also an avid donor to a number of char­i­ta­ble causes, of­ten top­ping lists of top celebrity donors. #5: Don­ald Trump net worth: US$3,1 bil­lion We de­bated whether or not Don­ald Trump be­longed on a list of the rich­est celebri­ties. Be­fore be­com­ing Pres­i­dent, he was both a busi­ness­man and a celebrity. The two iden­ti­ties were in­ter­twined. He was fa­mous for be­ing a busi­ness­man and he made a very suc­cess­ful busi­ness thanks largely to his fame. Then he be­came a politi­cian. It was a co­nun­drum. But I would still ar­gue that even af­ter be­com­ing Pres­i­dent, Don­ald is more associated as a celebrity than any­thing else. #4: Kanye West net worth: US$3,2 bil­lion Dur­ing his ca­reer to date Kanye West has earned “only” around US$400 mil­lion dur­ing his ca­reer from his mu­sic ca­reer (tour­ing, record sales, mer­chan­dise). He be­came a bil­lion­aire of­fi­cially in 2020 thanks to the ex­plo­sive suc­cess if the Yeezy cloth­ing brand. In 2019 Yeezy gen­er­ated US$1,5 bil­lion in rev­enue, earn­ing Kanye a US$154 mil­lion roy­alty pay­ment. In 2020, even with the Covid cri­sis, the brand is on pace to gen­er­ate US$1,7 bil­lion. Be­tween 2020 and 2026, Kanye is pro­jected to per­son­ally earn US$2,2 bil­lion in roy­al­ties alone off Yeezy. Here's the major dif­fer­ence be­tween Yeezy and the Jor­dan shoe brand — Imag­ine if in 2026 Michael Jor­dan PER­SON­ALLY owned 100 per­cent of his shoe brand? That's the deal Kanye could po­ten­tially pur­sue in the fu­ture. He owns 100 per­cent of Yeezy. #3: Oprah Win­frey net worth: US$3,5 bil­lion Oprah Win­frey is a me­dia mogul, en­tre­pre­neur, and phi­lan­thropist whose net worth is around US$3,5 bil­lion. Com­ing from hum­ble be­gin­nings, Oprah rose to promi­nence with The Oprah Win­frey Show, build­ing it up into one of the most suc­cess­ful talk shows in the coun­try and mak­ing her one of the most in­flu­en­tial women in the world. Through her Harpo pro­duc­tion com­pany, Oprah man­aged to build her wealth and branch out into a number of other areas, in­clud­ing film, pub­lish­ing, and the cre­ation of a tele­vi­sion net­work. #2:Steven Spiel­berg net worth: US$3,7 bil­lion Steven Spiel­berg is a di­rec­tor, screen­writer, and pro­ducer known for es­sen­tially cre­at­ing the con­cept of the Hol­ly­wood block­buster. An avid fan of film from a young age, Spiel­berg shot to fame with the re­lease of the film Jaws in 1975. More hits fol­lowed, in­clud­ing the In­di­ana Jones fran­chise, E.T., and Juras­sic Park. His wealth is a di­rect prod­uct of this suc­cess, as well as his roles as a pro­ducer on a number of other mas­sively popular films, in­clud­ing The Goonies, Grem­lins, and the Back to the Fu­ture fran­chise. #1: Ge­orge Lu­cas net worth: US$6,5 bil­lion Cre­ator of some of the most suc­cess­ful film fran­chises in his­tory, Ge­orge Lu­cas is a di­rec­tor, film pro­ducer, and writer with a net worth of around US$6,5 bil­lion. He is known as the cre­ator of the Star Wars and In­di­ana Jones fran­chises and has pro­duced a number of other hit movies over the years, in­clud­ing Body Heat, Labyrinth, and Wil­low. Though al­ready worth a great amount due to his pre­vi­ous fran­chises and some smart busi­ness de­ci­sions early in his ca­reer, Lu­cas earned a whop­ping US$4,1 bil­lion from the sale of Star Wars to Dis­ney in 2012, eas­ily ce­ment­ing his legacy as one of the most suc­cess­ful film­mak­ers of all time. So what's the les­son here? I think the big­gest take­away is we all should have gone to film school to be a di­rec­tor! Con­grats to Ge­orge Lu­cas. It's fairly stun­ning to think just how much money he made off this one film fran­chise. And I bet he doesn't even like Star Wars that much any­more. Do you think he's seen the new movies and shows? Prob­a­bly not. An­other major take­away af­ter look­ing at the top 12 rich­est celebri­ties (all of whom hap­pen to be bil­lion­aires) — Clearly it pays to own some­thing. To earn an enor­mous for­tune you can't just be a highly paid em­ployee. You need to build some­thing that you your­self own, so some­day you can sell that thing for bil­lions of dol­lars. What are you gonna build to earn your bil­lion dol­lar for­tune??? Sum­mary With a net worth of US$6,5 bil­lion, Ge­orge Lu­cas is the rich­est celebrity in the world 2020. His good buddy Steven Spiel­berg clocks in at #2 with a net worth of US$3,7 bil­lion. Oprah rounds out the top three with US$3,5 bil­lion. Kanye West rock­ets to #4 with a net worth of US$3,2 bil­lion, hav­ing not pre­vi­ously cracked the top 30. That's the power of Yeezy! Here is a quick-hit list of the top 10 rich­est celebri­ties in the world right now: #1) Ge­orge Lu­cas net worth US$6,5b #2) Steven Spiel­berg net worth US$3,7 bil­lion #3) Oprah Win­frey net worth US$3,5 bil­lion #4) Kanye West net worth US$3,2 bil­lion #5) Don­ald Trump net worth US$3,1b #6) Jami Gertz net worth US$3 bil­lion #7) Michael Jor­dan net worth US$2,2 bil­lion #8) Paul McCart­ney net worth US$1,2 bil­lion #9) David Cop­per­field net worth US$1 bil­lion #10) Jay-Z net worth US$1 bil­lion — celebri­tynet­worth.com",津巴布韦

The con­ti­nent would want to be as­sisted to put up in­fra­struc­ture such as rail, roads and elec­tric­ity gen­er­at­ing plants that ser­vice say an en­tire re­gion,” he said. Min­is­ter Bimha said the re­cent State visit to Zim­babwe by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent, Xi Jin­ping saw the two coun­tries sign­ing deals that in­cluded util­i­ties to do with power. Pres­i­dent Xi and South African Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma are co-chair­ing the sum­mit that ends tomorrow. The sum­mit, held un­der the theme: “China-Africa Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment,” comes af­ter Pres­i­dent Xi’s two­day State visit to Zim­babwe. The two coun­tries signed 12 land­mark agree­ments to fund vi­tal projects in key eco­nomic sec­tors. The sum­mit is the sec­ond in the 15-year history of FOCAC and the first on the African con­ti­nent af­ter the Beijing Sum­mit in 2006. In a state­ment last week ahead of his two-day State visit to Zim­babwe, Pres­i­dent Xi said he looked for­ward to join­ing African lead­ers at the focac Sum­mit, “and work­ing with them to ad­vance our friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion, lift China-Africa sol­i­dar­ity to a new high and build a bet­ter fu­ture for China-Africa friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Xi said con­sol­i­da­tion of re­la­tions with Zim­babwe and other African na­tions re­mained a cor­ner­stone of China’s for­eign pol­icy. “In con­duct­ing China’s re­la­tions with Africa, we ad­here to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, prac­ti­cal re­sults, affin­ity and good faith and up­hold the val­ues of friend­ship, jus­tice and shared in­ter­ests,” said Pres­i­dent Xi. “We will work with Zim­babwe and all other friendly African na­tions to pave a broader and more solid road of mu­tual ben­e­fit and com­mon de­vel­op­ment for China and Africa.” Pres­i­dent Xi said China val­ues the im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to the sol­i­dar­ity and de­vel­op­ment of Africa that Zim­babwe has made af­ter Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe as­sumed the chair­man­ship of the African Union. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, over the past 15 years, the trade vol­ume be­tween China and Africa has soared from $10 bil­lion to $220 bil­lion. Dur­ing the same pe­riod, China’s direct in­vest­ment in Africa has sharply in­creased from $500 mil­lion to $30 bil­lion. There are more than 3 000 Chi­nese com­pa­nies run­ning their busi­ness in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent World Bank re­port, since the turn of the cen­tury, the sub-Sa­ha­ran re­gion has main­tained ro­bust eco­nomic growth which would oth­er­wise be im­pos­si­ble with­out its eco­nomic ties with China Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to South Africa, Tian Xue­jun, was re­cently quoted in the me­dia say­ing, the sum­mit will fur­ther syn­er­gise China and Africa’s re­spec­tive de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. “Cur­rently, both China and Africa are at the cru­cial stage of de­vel­op­ment and have formulated am­bi­tious de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. China has put for­ward the two cen­te­nary goals and the Fifth Ple­nary Ses­sion of the 18th Com­mu­nist Party of China Cen­tral Com­mit­tee has pro­posed the 13th Five-Year Pro­gramme,” he said. “The African Union has adopted Agenda 2063 and its first Ten-Year Im­ple­men­ta­tion Plan. China and Africa are mov­ing for­ward in the same di­rec­tion. Dur­ing the up­com­ing sum­mit, lead­ers of China and Africa will gather in South Africa to dis­cuss the ways to fur­ther align China and Africa’s de­vel­op­ment strate­gies and map out the new blueprint for China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion.” The Am­bas­sador said, dur­ing the sum­mit, China will an­nounce new mea­sures of co­op­er­a­tion with Africa for the next three years, “which is both a tra­di­tion and a defin­ing fea­ture of focac.” “Th­ese new mea­sures will di­rectly serve the de­vel­op­ment strate­gies of both sides. Pri­or­i­ties will be given to ad­dress two ma­jor bot­tle­necks con­strain­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely the back­ward in­fra­struc­ture and the lack of pro­fes­sion­als,” he said. “More­over, China will fo­cus on is­sues con­cern­ing African peo­ple’s well-be­ing, like food, em­ploy­ment and health, and strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in such ma­jor ar­eas as in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture build­ing, pub­lic health and poverty re­duc­tion, in­vest­ment and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, peace and se­cu­rity and green de­vel­op­ment.” Am­bas­sador Tian said China is the largest con­trib­u­tor of peace­keep­ers in Africa among all the per­ma­nent mem­bers of the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. “As we speak, 90 per­cent of China’s over­seas peace­keep­ers are per­form­ing du­ties in Africa and the ac­cu­mu­lated num­ber has reached more than 30 000. China also ac­tively en­gages in the in­ter­na­tional counter-piracy oper­a­tions in the Gulf of Aden and wa­ters off the So­mali coast. Up to now, China has sent 21 batches of al­to­gether 60 ves­sels and es­corted over 6 000 ships,” he said. “China is ac­tively im­ple­ment­ing the ‘Ini­tia­tive on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tive Part­ner­ship for Peace and Se­cu­rity’ and has pro­vided mil­i­tary and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to the AU for peace­keep­ing mis­sions in rel­e­vant coun­tries and the build­ing of the African Standby Force and the African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Cri­sis,” he said. Pres­i­dent Xi an­nounced at the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly in Septem­ber that China will in the com­ing five years pro­vide free mil­i­tary aid of $100 mil­lion to the African Union to sup­port the build­ing of the African Standby Force and the African Ca­pac­ity for Im­me­di­ate Re­sponse to Cri­sis.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160621,Africa’s en­gage­ment with China,"THE sin­gle most im­por­tant is­sue in Africa’s in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions in the 21st cen­tury has been its strate­gic part­ner­ship with China. Al­though Chi­nese en­gage­ment with Africa goes back to the 1950s, it is from the late 1990s that we see move­ments to­wards the es­tab­lish­ment of a frame­work for mu­tual ne­go­ti­a­tion be­tween the two par­ties in the form of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC). In this re­gard the visit to the con­ti­nent by then Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Jiang Zemin in 1996 was im­por­tant. How­ever, be­fore delv­ing into the gist of this sub­mis­sion, it should be em­pha­sised that Africa’s re­la­tion­ship with China is in­deed a spe­cial one. For ex­am­ple, in 1971, Africa voted re­sound­ingly in the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly to pave the way for the Peo­ple’s Republic of China’s re­place­ment of Tai­wan as the le­git­i­mate rep­re­sen­ta­tive of Chi­nese peo­ple in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. In 1970 China fi­nanced the Tan­za­nia-Zam­bia Rail­way Line (Tazara or Tan­zam) to pro­vide (mainly) Zam­bia with an al­ter­na­tive route to the port of Dar-es-Salaam for the pur­poses of ex­port­ing its cop­per. The Chi­nese pro­vided an in­ter­est free loan of about $600 mil­lion to­wards this project which they built and com­pleted in a record time of five years (1970-75). It should be high­lighted that West­ern states as well as In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions (IFIs) had re­fused to fund this project cit­ing the rea­son that it was not eco­nom­i­cally vi­able. The Chi­nese are also cred­ited with sup­port­ing guerilla move­ments against white mi­nor­ity rule es­pe­cially in the South­ern African coun­tries of An­gola and Zim­babwe. In Zim­babwe, the Chi­nese sup­port of Zanu-PF dur­ing the lib­er­a­tion war set the base for “fruit­ful” post-in­de­pen­dence en­gage­ments be­tween the two coun­tries. Per­haps, an­other is­sue to note that marks the spe­cial re­la­tion­ship be­tween Africa and China is that when the Chi­nese govern­ment ruth­lessly quashed pro-democ­racy protests in Tianan­men Square in 1989, African lead­ers de­fended Beijing’s ac­tions on the ba­sis that it was a do­mes­tic is­sue that did not need ex­ter­nal West­ern in­ter­fer­ence in its res­o­lu­tion. This was af­ter se­vere West­ern crit­i­cism of the Beijing regime’s heavy handed han­dling of the whole is­sue. The birth of the FOCAC in 2000 not only marked the resur­gence of the China-Africa part­ner­ship, but be­came a sign that ide­o­log­i­cal is­sues (that had dom­i­nated the cold war) would now play a lesser role and strate­gic eco­nomic con­sid­er­a­tions would now take cen­tre-stage. Diplo­matic is­sues in­clud­ing the need for Africa’s sup­port at mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rums, how­ever, still re­main im­por­tant. China’s goals in en­gag­ing Africa, from 2000, have specif­i­cally been tai­lored to a num­ber of is­sues: its need of en­ergy re­sources (es­pe­cially oil) since the coun­try be­came a net oil im­porter in 1993; its thirst for Africa’s abun­dant min­eral wealth, its de­sire to carve a niche mar­ket for its labour in­ten­sive (and some­times low qual­ity) goods as well as its de­sire to open av­enues for its State Owned En­ter­prises (SOEs) and pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies to in­vest and gain ex­pe­ri­ence-pur­suant to China’s go-global pol­icy. In the FOCAC, the Chi­nese have made var­i­ous de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance pledges since 2000 and these pledges have been in­creas­ing ex­po­nen­tially over the years. For, ex­am­ple, at the Beijing FOCAC meet­ing in 2006, Pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao promised that Africa would re­ceive $5 bil­lion in con­ces­sional loans and pref­er­en­tial cred­its as well as $5 bil­lion for the China Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund. At the FOCAC meet­ing in Egypt in 2009, Pre­mier Wen Ji­abao promised that Africa would re­ceive an­other $10 bil­lion in con­ces­sional loans for 2010-2013. In 2012, Beijing pro­vided an­other $20 bil­lion for African de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance. In De­cem­ber 2015 at the Jo­han­nes­burg FOCAC sum­mit, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping an­nounced an un­prece­dented pledge of $60 bil­lion to sup­port agri­cul­ture, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment as well as hu­man re­sources train­ing in the con­ti­nent. Ad­di­tion­ally as a re­sult of FOCAC, Chi­nese bi­lat­eral trade with Africa reached about $300 bil­lion at the end of 2015, com­pared to the con­ti­nent’s two way trade with the USA which was about $50 bil­lion. Brief look at some African coun­tries At the mo­ment An­gola, Ghana, Ethiopia and to some ex­tent South Africa ap­pear to have vis­i­ble na­tional strate­gies on how to en­gage China in mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial ways. For ex­am­ple, a visit by this au­thor to Ethiopia in Oc­to­ber 2012 for a China-Africa Think Tanks Fo­rum, showed that the East African coun­try’s elite has put in place a ro­bust pol­icy frame­work that has al­lowed sig­nif­i­cant Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance to be quickly har­nessed for mas­sive in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment projects such as power plants, roads and rail­ways. In addition, ow­ing to in­vest­ment in­cen­tives availed to the Chi­nese by the Ethiopian govern­ment (lead­ing to es­tab­lish­ment of Ex­port Pro­cess­ing Zones/ Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones), China has be­come one of the largest in­vestors in Ethiopia. Ex­port Pro­cess­ing Zones have sig­nif­i­cantly con­trib­uted to Ethiopia’s ex­port earn­ings and em­ploy­ment cre­ation al­though the prob­lem of low wages and poor labour stan­dards still per­sist. Ad­di­tion­ally, de­spite the fact that Ethiopia is land­locked and lacks strate­gic min­er­als (such as oil), the Ethiopian Peo­ple’s Revo­lu­tion­ary Demo­cratic Front govern­ment have man­aged to lever­age on their po­si­tion as a re­gional peace guar­an­tor and as Africa’s diplo­matic cap­i­tal to be able to at­tract both Chi­nese and West­ern de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance. In this way they have man­aged to sus­tain an av­er­age eco­nomic growth rate of 10.7 per cent per year and to lift thou­sands of peo­ple out poverty each year, a feat which has led var­i­ous ob­servers to clas­sify Ethiopia as a de­vel­op­men­tal state. In­deed, it has been fore­casted that if Ethiopia con­tin­ues on this tra­jec­tory, it could at­tain mid­dle in­come sta­tus by 2025. An­gola also ap­pears to have elab­o­rate strate­gies in their en­gage­ments with China. De­spite the low in­ter­na­tional oil prices af­fect­ing African oil pro­duc­ers and sig­nif­i­cant lev­els of elite cor­rup­tion, An­gola has man­aged to lever­age on their re­serves to at­tract sig­nif­i­cant Chi­nese de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance as well as pro­vid­ing a coun­ter­bal­ance to tra­di­tional West­ern part­ners. In fact they have cre­ated an en­vi­ron­ment in which oil op­er­ates as a mag­nate to at­tract both Chi­nese and West­ern fi­nanciers for the pur­poses of in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment. They have used what is called the “An­gola model” which uses oil (and or) other min­eral re­sources as col­lat­eral in de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance en­gage­ments. Al­though this method has its own chal­lenges, it has given An­gola the much needed post-war re­con­struc­tion fi­nances which the IMF and the World Bank were hes­i­tant to pro­vide in the first place. Bil­lions of dol­lars’ worth of in­fra­struc­ture deals have been agreed to in ar­eas such as health, ed­u­ca­tion, agri­cul­ture and gen­eral poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. By 2010, China had ex­tended more than $10.5 bil­lion in this way to An­gola. In Zim­babwe, bear­ing in mind that some of the de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance ar­range­ments are shrouded in opac­ity and se­crecy, as well as the con­cern that the coun­try’s debt bur­den is in­creas­ing, Chi­nese fi­nanc­ing is play­ing a key role in ad­dress­ing power chal­lenges. The $320 mil­lion loan for the con­struc­tion of the Kariba South Hy­dro Power Sta­tion as well as the pro­vi­sion of a $1.2 bil­lion dol­lar fa­cil­ity for the ex­pan­sion of the Hwange power sta­tion are sig­nif­i­cant cases in point. This also dis­pels the no­tion that Chi­nese fi­nanc­ing in Africa only flows to oil pro­duc­ing na­tions. Other ex­am­ples can be drawn from other “smaller” and rel­a­tively less re­source en­dowed coun­tries in Africa such as Benin and Rwanda. Chal­lenges While at­tend­ing an Africa-China con­fer­ence in La­gos Nige­ria in March 2016, one theme seemed to per­me­ate most of the dis­cus­sions; the fact that African states have the po­ten­tial to ex­ert more agency and ex­tract more ben­e­fits in their en­gage­ments with China. How­ever, for this to hap­pen, there is need for African coun­tries to come up with na­tional, sub-re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal strate­gies on how they should en­gage China in a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial man­ner. We came short of stat­ing that Africa is yet to have a strat­egy with which to en­gage China and to me, this is Africa’s great­est un­do­ing. Instead of hav­ing a com­mon con­ti­nen­tal po­si­tion, African states choose to com­pete against each other. Instead of di­rect­ing the Chi­nese to en­gage African states to­gether in a mul­ti­lat­eral fo­rum, Africa states choose to ne­go­ti­ate in­di­vid­u­ally at a bi­lat­eral level for dif­fer­ent projects. Possibly, to some African states, a com­mon ap­proach to en­gag­ing China is per­ceived to be­stow in­vest­ment ad­van­tages to those coun­tries that have rel­a­tively bet­ter eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture (roads, rail­way, and power) than to those with­out. So far, the African Union has failed to rally African states to­wards a com­mon ne­go­ti­at­ing po­si­tion with the Chi­nese and this gives cre­dence to the view that Africa does not yet have a China strat­egy. Be­sides the re­ported AU-China in­fra­struc­ture fi­nanc­ing Mem­o­ran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing signed in Jan­uary 2015 (which had scant de­tails and no price tag), noth­ing tan­gi­ble has been done in this di­rec­tion. The need for com­bined ne­go­ti­at­ing po­si­tions is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in view of the press­ing need to en­cour­age re­gional in­te­gra­tion. How­ever, just like at the con­ti­nen­tal level, African sub­re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions do not as yet have elab­o­rate strate­gies for en­gag­ing and lev­er­ag­ing from their re­la­tions with China. Instead of ne­go­ti­at­ing for de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance that can be chan­neled to­wards ad­dress­ing re­gional en­ergy and com­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture deficits, African states are choos­ing to fo­cus in­ter­nally. This stance mil­i­tates against the avowed at­tempts at es­tab­lish­ing sub-re­gional eco­nomic growth nodes in the con­ti­nent. An­other pertinent is­sue that con­fronts African states in their en­gage­ment with China is the lack of di­ver­si­fied economies. Overde­pen­dence on com­mod­ity ex­ports leaves the con­ti­nent prone to in­ter­na­tional price fluc­tu­a­tions. Re­cently, China has sought to re­ori­ent its econ­omy from goods pro­duc­tion to knowl­edge pro­duc­tion through in­no­va­tion. This means China is tran­si­tion­ing from the “made in China” to the “de­signed in China” phase. Al­ready, sig­nif­i­cantly ow­ing to Chi­nese eco­nomic slow­down, African com­mod­ity economies are feel­ing the pinch. In Zam­bia, cop­per mines are clos­ing and in South Africa, it is es­ti­mated that 19,000 jobs may be lost in the min­ing sec­tor this year alone. Thus, go­ing into the fu­ture, there is grad­u­ally go­ing to be re­duced Chi­nese ap­petite for African com­modi­ties, hence the need for eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion. Africa should take ad­van­tage of its en­gage­ment with China to tap valu­able skills and tech­nolo­gies that can be used in value addition and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. Maybe as a rec­om­men­da­tion, added to the re­sources­for-in­fra­struc­ture deals, African states should also adopt re­sources for skills or re­sources for tech­nol­ogy deals. This can lead to the ac­qui­si­tion of im­por­tant sci­en­tific knowl­edge that is im­por­tant for Africa’s eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180904,FOCAC: China-Africa ties set to grow,"With re­gard to strength­en­ing African ini­tia­tives, the FOCAC sum­mit is ex­pected to share knowl­edge on ef­fec­tive prac­tices that would en­able African coun­tries to in­crease in­trare­gional trade in pur­suance of the ob­jec­tives of the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (ACFTA). AFRICAN and Chi­nese lead­ers are set to re­view and ad­vance co­op­er­a­tion as they meet in Bei­jing to pre­pare a new ac­tion plan for mu­tual and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The 3rd Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) cur­rently un­der­way is ex­pected to pro­vide a plat­form to strengthen so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment in both Africa and China. The theme is “To­wards an Even Stronger Com­mu­nity with a Shared Fu­ture through Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion”. FOCAC 2018 is ex­pected to fo­cus on var­i­ous is­sues of mu­tual in­ter­est, in­clud­ing co­op­er­a­tion on agri­cul­tural trans­for­ma­tion, in­dus­trial and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment as well as science and tech­nol­ogy, with a key fo­cus on business de­vel­op­ment through the High-Level Di­a­logue of China-Africa Lead­ers and Business Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and the 6th China-Africa Business Fo­rum. The lead­ers from Africa and China will dis­cuss strength­en­ing strate­gic re­la­tions, con­sol­i­da­tion of po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion, as well as de­vel­op­ment of the bi­lat­eral ties in the con­text of the One Belt, One Road Ini­tia­tive and the African Union Agenda 2063. The One Belt, One Road Ini­tia­tive, an­nounced by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping in 2013, is a de­vel­op­ment pol­icy with a holis­tic vi­sion of eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity de­vel­op­ment to ini­ti­ate joint ac­tion to build a new world or­der that is de­vel­op­ment-ori­ented, for mu­tual pros­per­ity and hu­man se­cu­rity. Agenda 2063 is a con­ti­nen­tal strat­egy adopted by the AU in 2013 and aims to op­ti­mise the use of Africa’s re­sources for African de­vel­op­ment to en­able the con­ti­nent to take its place in the world econ­omy. The Agenda seeks to have a highly de­vel­oped and in­ter­con­nected con­ti­nent by 2063, in­clud­ing rail­way, and ini­tia­tives such as One Belt One Road are crit­i­cal to meet­ing th­ese tar­gets. China-Africa re­la­tions have con­tin­ued to change, strengthen and trans­form in the 21st cen­tury, since FOCAC was es­tab­lished in the year 2000. China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion has strength­ened Africa’s de­vel­op­ment in very many ways, through in­vest­ment, trade and de­vel­op­ment that has en­abled the con­ti­nent to ex­pe­ri­ence so­cio-eco­nomic growth at a faster rate than most other con­ti­nents. China is Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, hav­ing de­vel­oped a mu­tual, sound and vibrant part­ner­ship with trade vol­ume be­tween the two in­creas­ing ex­po­nen­tially over the past decade, ris­ing from about US$10 bil­lion in 2000 to more than US$198 bil­lion in 2012. With re­gard to strength­en­ing African ini­tia­tives, the FOCAC sum­mit is ex­pected to share knowl­edge on ef­fec­tive prac­tices that would en­able African coun­tries to in­crease in­tra-re­gional trade in pur­suance of the ob­jec­tives of the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (ACFTA). The launch of the ACFTA on March 21 2018 was a bold move by Africa to re­form in­ter­nal trade, which had been struc­tured in such a way that African coun­tries, which pos­sess the bulk of nat­u­ral re­sources, trade more with the out­side world than among them­selves. The ACFTA is a flag­ship project of Agenda 2063. In ad­di­tion, African re­gional blocs have lately placed greater em­pha­sis on in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion while con­tin­u­ing to pri­ori­tise agri­cul­ture and trade. For ex­am­ple, the South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC) adopted the SADC In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion Strat­egy and Roadmap 2015-2063, which is an in­clu­sive long-term plan for mod­erni­sa­tion and eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion that should en­able sus­tained eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to raise liv­ing stan­dards. The FOCAC Sum­mit is ex­pected to strengthen China-Africa re­la­tions and fur­ther re­con­struct global af­fairs by ex­plor­ing new mod­els and ap­proaches to­wards a more eq­ui­table and in­clu­sive sys­tem that pro­motes sus­tain­able so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. The 2018 FOCAC Sum­mit is sig­nif­i­cant as this year marks the 40th an­niver­sary of China’s re­form and open­ing up pol­icy and the fifth an­niver­sary of the One Belt One Road pol­icy. In Africa, the ini­tia­tive has al­ready achieved tan­gi­ble re­sults through in­fra­struc­ture projects such as the rail­way that links land­locked Ethiopia to the sea through Dji­bouti, and the Ma­puto Cross-Sea Bridge in Mozam­bique, among other projects. The FOCAC plat­form is based on the prin­ci­ples of South-South co­op­er­a­tion and mu­tual ben­e­fit, with a view to ad­dress­ing var­i­ous ar­eas of con­cern for Africa’s so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and in­te­gra­tion. African Heads of State and Govern­ment, as well as heads of re­gional or­gan­i­sa­tions and mul­ti­lat­eral or­gan­i­sa­tions are at­tend­ing the third FOCAC Sum­mit. The pre­vi­ous FOCAC Sum­mit, the se­cond, was held in Jo­han­nes­burg, South Africa, in De­cem­ber 2015 and adopted the “Dec­la­ra­tion of the Jo­han­nes­burg Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion”. The dec­la­ra­tion and ac­tion plan con­tain spe­cific mea­sures aimed at con­sol­i­dat­ing the grow­ing mu­tual part­ner­ship be­tween Africa and China. The dec­la­ra­tion and ac­tion plan cov­ered a wide range of sec­tors of the African con­ti­nent, in­clud­ing im­prove­ment of the con­ti­nent’s in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, up­grad­ing ru­ral and ur­ban set­tle­ments, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion, health im­prove­ment, cul­ture and peo­ple to peo­ple ex­change, and peace and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion. At the 2015 sum­mit, Pres­i­dent Xi an­nounced 10 China-Africa co­op­er­a­tion projects, sup­ported by a US$60 bil­lion fund. At FOCAC 2018 he will de­liver strate­gic ad­dresses pre­sent­ing China’s vi­sion for a shared fu­ture, propos­ing new ideas to strengthen re­la­tions and new mea­sures for co­op­er­a­tion. Pres­i­dent Xi will also at­tend and de­liver a speech at the open­ing of the High-Level Di­a­logue of China-Africa Lead­ers and Business Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and the 6th China-Africa Business Fo­rum. The sum­mit was pre­ceded by the 7th Min­is­te­rial Con­fer­ence of FOCAC, which was co-chaired by the for­eign min­is­ters and com­merce min­is­ters from both China and South Africa. Min­is­ters re­spon­si­ble for for­eign af­fairs and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion from 54 African coun­tries were ex­pected to par­tic­i­pate. FOCAC 2018 is the largest gath­er­ing of African lead­ers in China, and is a land­mark sum­mit for South-South co­op­er­a­tion and for global de­vel­op­ment. - sardc.net",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190620,US-Africa Sum­mit: A re­sponse China?,"The in­vest­ment in Africa comes as Trump is cut­ting aid to other low­in­come coun­tries. Ear­lier this week, he an­nounced he will slash hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in aid to Hon­duras, Gu­atemala and El Sal­vador all low­in­come coun­tries strug­gling with poverty, hunger and vi­o­lence be­cause thou­sands of their cit­i­zens have sought asy­lum in the United States ELEVEN heads of state and government and more than 1 000 busi­ness lead­ers are meet­ing in Mozam­bique this week for the US-Africa Busi­ness Sum­mit ahead of the launch of a new, am­bi­tious $60 bil­lion United States in­vest­ment agency that some an­a­lysts are call­ing a “once-in-a-gen­er­a­tional op­por­tu­nity” for the con­ti­nent as well as a bid by the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to di­rectly counter China’s in­flu­ence here. The United States In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (DFC) will more than dou­ble the amount of money avail­able for US in­vest­ment in low and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries than was pre­vi­ously avail­able through the Over­seas Pri­vate In­vest­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (OPIC) and the De­vel­op­ment Credit Au­thor­ity (DCA). Many of the coun­tries sup­ported by this new agency will be in Africa. Cre­ated through the bi­par­ti­san-sup­ported BUILD Act of 2018, DFC will al­low lim­ited eq­uity in­vest­ments for the first time and will pro­vide tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance and in­creased over­sight on de­vel­op­ment projects. It will also more than dou­ble the in­vest­ment cap, ac­cord­ing to the agency’s web­site. The new $60 bil­lion in­vest­ment cap cre­ates an “op­por­tu­nity to re­frame how de­vel­op­ment fi­nance ex­e­cutes in Wash­ing­ton,” Aubrey Hruby, a senior fel­low with the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Africa Cen­tre and co-au­thor of the book The Next Africa, told Al Jazeera. “That it comes under Trump, who has drawn ire for his com­ments about Africa and who pre­vi­ously pro­posed scrap­ping fund­ing for OPIC, is “ut­terly sur­pris­ing,” she said. “I think a lot of peo­ple who care about Africa, when the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion first started and OPIC was ze­roed out in the bud­get and the view was they didn’t care about Africa, never would have an­tic­i­pated such a de­vel­op­ment,” Hruby said. “But in many ways, there have been more re­sources put to Africa, or African op­por­tu­ni­ties, and US com­pa­nies in Africa under the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion than any other ad­min­is­tra­tion be­fore.” ‘A ro­bust al­ter­na­tive’ to the Chi­nese model? Ex­perts say there are sev­eral rea­sons why the US is up­ping its in­vest­ment game in Africa now. Part of DFC’s stated mis­sion is to “pro­vide fi­nan­cially sound al­ter­na­tives to state-led ini­tia­tives from coun­tries like China”. Africa is also the fo­cus of many in­vestors. While for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) is down world­wide for the third straight year, Africa re­ceived $46 bil­lion in FDI in 2018, up 11 per­cent from 2017, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the United Na­tions. The US hopes its new agency will counter China’s in­vest­ment in­flu­ence on the con­ti­nent. “The DFC will pro­vide a ro­bust al­ter­na­tive . . .The DFC will in­cen­tivise pri­vate sec­tor-led de­vel­op­ment projects that ad­here to high stan­dards and are fi­nan­cially vi­able over the long haul, while en­sur­ing that con­tracts are trans­par­ent and that trans­ac­tions prop­erly as­sess eco­nomic and so­cial im­pacts,” Worku Ga­chou, OPIC’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Africa, told Al Jazeera. “Our ap­proach doesn’t sad­dle lo­cal gov­ern­ments and pop­u­la­tions with debt, and pro­motes eco­nomic growth,” Ga­chou said. “We fa­cil­i­tate eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment that ben­e­fits coun­tries by sup­port­ing sovereignty, cre­at­ing jobs for lo­cal work­ers, sup­port­ing women’s eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment, and in­vest­ing in projects built to last. “At a time when state-based in­vestors are pour­ing large amounts into in­fra­struc­ture projects, OPIC and the DFC in­vest through a model that is pri­vate-sec­tor led. Our goal is to sup­port projects that are win-win for in­vestors and the coun­tries.” More tools to in­vest Hruby said the new agency’s im­pact won’t just be felt in the form of more cap­i­tal. It also gives US in­vestors more tools to in­vest over­seas. In ad­di­tion to OPIC’s pre­ex­ist­ing “loans, loan guar­an­tees, po­lit­i­cal risk in­sur­ance, and in­vest­ment funds”, DFC will also be able to make eq­uity in­vest­ments, ac­cord­ing to the agency’s web­site. In the past, the US wasn’t on equal foot­ing with Euro­pean fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions that could pro­vide eq­uity in Africa, Hruby ex­plained. In 2017, France topped the list of coun­tries with for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in the con­ti­nent, fol­lowed by the Nether­lands, the UK and the US. “Since its found­ing in the 70s, OPIC was lim­ited to op­er­at­ing with debt. So they ba­si­cally could only give debt to pri­vate eq­uity funds or debt to projects,” Hruby ex­plained. “Now, under the new DFC, they will be able to give eq­uity, and that al­lows for a lot more flex­i­bil­ity, so they’ll be able to seed new pri­vate eq­uity funds for Africa, for ex­am­ple. Be­fore they could not seed them be­cause funds would have to raise an­chor cap­i­tal and then lever­age OPIC debt.” Steven Grin is a man­ag­ing part­ner of Lat­eral Cap­i­tal, an Africa-fo­cused ven­ture fund. Grin wrote on his fund’s blog that he be­lieves that the DFC is the “most im­por­tant de­vel­op­ment” in eco­nomic diplo­macy since the Mar­shall Plan, which dis­trib­uted $13 bil­lion in US aid to help re­build Europe af­ter World War II. “I be­lieve it is one of the most im­por­tant ini­tia­tives in US com­mer­cial diplo­macy in over 50 years. For com­pa­nies like Lat­eral, it rep­re­sents an op­por­tu­nity to ac­cess eq­uity from a part­ner like the DFC while not crowd­ing out other de­vel­op­ment-ori­ented cap­i­tal,” Grin told Al Jazeera, adding that his firm plans to reach out to DFC when its eq­uity win­dow goes live. DFC will of­fi­cially be­come op­er­a­tional on Oc­to­ber 1. Will it work? That it is Trump who is po­ten­tially spread­ing US in­flu­ence by dou­bling US in­vest­ment dol­lars for low and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries comes as a sur­prise to some an­a­lysts. Trump has been crit­i­cised for his com­ments about such coun­tries, in­clud­ing call­ing El Sal­vador, Haiti and Africa “s****hole coun­tries” dur­ing a dis­cus­sion about im­mi­gra­tion in 2018. Trump later tweeted that he had used “tough” lan­guage, but de­nied mak­ing the re­marks. The in­vest­ment in Africa comes as Trump is cut­ting aid to other low-in­come coun­tries. Ear­lier this week, he an­nounced he will slash hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in aid to Hon­duras, Gu­atemala and El Sal­vador — all low-in­come coun­tries strug­gling with poverty, hunger and vi­o­lence — be­cause thou­sands of their cit­i­zens have sought asy­lum in the US. And while the in­vest­ment po­ten­tial of DFC in Africa is huge, nei­ther Trump nor any mem­ber of his cab­i­net is at­tend­ing the US-Africa Busi­ness Sum­mit this week, some­thing crit­ics have pointed to as a sign of the lim­ited scope of Trump’s in­ter­est in Africa in gen­eral, Deutsche Welle re­ported. The high­est-rank­ing mem­ber of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to at­tend this week’s sum­mit is Deputy Com­merce Sec­re­tary Karen Dunn Kel­ley, who is among its speak­ers. “Africa is el­e­vated only in the con­text of com­pe­ti­tion with China,” Hruby said. “So I don’t nec­es­sar­ily think that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion cares about African coun­tries on their own mer­its, but rather as a field of com­pe­ti­tion for in­flu­ence and eco­nomic op­por­tu­nity with China.” And al­though the in­vest­ment from the US government will soon be there, it’s un­clear how many US busi­nesses will take DFC up on its of­fer. “It is clear that US com­pa­nies do not have a great ap­petite for African op­por­tu­ni­ties, de­spite the growth div­i­dend po­ten­tial,” Grin said, adding that rea­sons for this include “a strong US econ­omy” and the fact that “Trump in­jected un­cer­tainty in global trade”. “The US DFC is a strong sig­nal that African mark­ers are a pri­or­ity and will get sup­port. These en­ti­ties pro­vide US cor­po­rates the op­por­tu­nity to com­pete head-on with Chi­nese cor­po­rates that have had state back­ing for years, leav­ing US com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing with two hands tied behind their back,” he added. Hruby said whether US com­pa­nies take DFC up on the of­fer, they have more tools than ever be­fore to in­vest in the con­ti­nent. “The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is try­ing to ex­pand the com­mer­cial tool­box that ex­ists to help US com­pa­nies in African mar­kets. Will it work? We don’t know be­cause the global con­text is what it is,” she said. “Re­turns in the US are very high. So I’m not sure that US com­pa­nies will want to ven­ture out­side when they can just stay at home and make a lot of money. But we have more tools than we’ve ever had be­fore.” — Al Jazeera.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20180905,ED pledges re­forms,"PRES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa yes­ter­day pledged a cock­tail of eco­nomic re­forms set to im­prove the in­vest­ment cli­mate and en­hance pol­icy clar­ity, con­sis­tency and pre­dictabil­ity. In his ad­dress at the 2018 Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) in Bei­jing, the Pres­i­dent said his ad­min­is­tra­tion was on a mis­sion to ac­cel­er­ate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, mod­erni­sa­tion and mech­a­ni­sa­tion of the econ­omy. He said would help en­sure Zim­babwe be­comes a mid­dle in­come econ­omy with a per­capita in­come of $3 500, in­creased in­vest­ment, de­cent jobs, broad-based em­pow­er­ment, free from poverty and cor­rup­tion by 2030. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said China re­mained Africa’s num­ber one in­vest­ment and trade part­ner and wel­comed the con­tin­ued fund­ing of FOCAC projects, not­ing it am­pli­fies the rise of a diver­si­fied African econ­omy in line with the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area. “Zim­babwe re­mains de­ter­mined to play its part in the re­al­i­sa­tion of en­hanced con­nec­tiv­ity, in­te­gra­tion and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment,” he said. “My Gov­ern­ment is also un­der­tak­ing com­pre­hen­sive eco­nomic re­forms set to im­prove our in­vest­ment cli­mate and en­hance pol­icy clar­ity, con­sis­tency and pre­dictabil­ity.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe was ready to co­op­er­ate with other coun­tries. “We have set out an am­bi­tious and yet achiev­able pro­gramme of mod­ernising our in­fra­struc­ture and en­sur­ing that our roads, rail­way net­work, air con­nec­tiv­ity, ICTs and Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones talk to the re­gion, the con­ti­nent and the world at large,” he said. “We are open to co­op­er­ate with other coun­tries within FOCAC frame­work and the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa ap­plauded FOCAC for pri­ori­tis­ing eco­nomic di­a­logue hinged on mu­tual re­spect. “It is com­mend­able that FOCAC con­tin­ues to pri­ori­tise eco­nomic di­a­logue, founded on peace­ful de­vel­op­ment, mu­tual re­spect, friend­ship, com­mon pros­per­ity and in­clu­sive g Notwith­stand­ing the move to se­cure new lines of credit, Min­is­ter Chi­na­masa said Zim­babwe was look­ing to take ad­van­tage of the $60 bil­lion fa­cil­ity for African coun­tries an­nounced by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping dur­ing the of­fi­cial open­ing of FOCAC 2018 on Mon­day. The $60 bil­lion fa­cil­ity will be pro­vided in the form of Gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance as well as in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and com­pa­nies. He said the con­ces­sion­ary loans will help grow the econ­omy as they do not in­crease the coun­try’s level of in­debt­ness. “We have to come up with bank­able plans (to ac­cess the $60 bil­lion fa­cil­ity). The lines of credit will build our ca­pac­ity to hon­our our obli­ga­tions, so yes, tem­po­rar­ily it will have an ef­fect on our in­debt­ed­ness but what our econ­omy is look­ing for right now is for­eign cur­rency to re­tool our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, to sup­ply raw ma­te­ri­als, to re-equip our mines, to mod­ernise our agri­cul­ture through mech­a­ni­sa­tion. “Once that is done then you have more pro­duc­tion and with more pro­duc­tion, th­ese prob­lems fall by the way­side,” said Min­is­ter Chi­na­masa. Mean­while, FOCAC 2018 closed yes­ter­day (Tues­day).

African con­ti­nent.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe’s econ­omy was agro-based and sus­cep­ti­ble to cli­mate change, but op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­isted in other sec­tors. “As an agro-based econ­omy, we re­main gravely con­cerned about the im­pact of cli­mate change,” he said. “We are ready to ex­pand co­op­er­a­tion on en­vi­ron­men­tal con­ser­va­tion and sus­tain­able re­source util­i­sa­tion. “With one of the largest lithium and coal bed meth­ane re­serves in Africa, my coun­try of­fers enor­mous op­por­tu­ni­ties to be­come a cen­tre for re­search, de­vel­op­ment, ex­ploita­tion and man­u­fac­tur­ing of green en­ergy so­lu­tions.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said ca­pac­ity build­ing was a key build­ing block in the growth of devel­op­ing economies and the fight against poverty. He took the op­por­tu­nity to ap­prise the sum­mit on the July 30 har­monised elec­tions, which he won. “Zim­babwe con­ducted its much an­tic­i­pated har­monised gen­eral elec­tions on 30th July 2018,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. “Th­ese were com­mended by in­ter­na­tional ob­servers for be­ing peace­ful, free, fair and trans­par­ent. We thank the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China for send­ing an ob­server mis­sion as well as Sadc, AU and EU. “My in­au­gu­ra­tion on 26 Au­gust 2018 marked the be­gin­ning of the Sec­ond Repub­lic in our coun­try.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160520,Nip drug and hu­man traf­fick­ing in the bud,"RE­PORTS that 200 Zim­bab­weans, mostly women, are on death row in China af­ter they were ar­rested for drug traf­fick­ing are shock­ing and should de­ter like-minded peo­ple from em­bark­ing on dan­ger­ous mis­sions for crooked syn­di­cates. The rev­e­la­tion comes hot on the heels of the traf­fick­ing of hun­dreds of women to Kuwait where they were promised jobs but were later turned into sex slaves, maids and other de­mean­ing me­nial tasks where they of­ten worked long hours with­out pay. Once some­thing sounds too good to be true, it of­ten is and Zim­bab­weans should learn from the un­for­tu­nate sce­nar­ios fac­ing some of their coun­try­men and women that there is no short­cut to suc­cess but the virtues of hard work and hon­esty are sacro­sanct in life. Par­lia­ment heard on Tues­day how most of the women on death row in China were duped by their Nige­rian boyfriends that they were go­ing shop­ping in prepa­ra­tion for wed­dings and drugs would be placed in their lug­gage with­out their knowl­edge. Women Af­fairs, Gen­der and Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment par­lia­men­tary port­fo­lio com­mit­tee chair­per­son Cde Beatrice Nyamupinga moved a mo­tion on hu­man traf­fick­ing where she made the rev­e­la­tions. The Zanu-PF MP for Goromonzi said the Nige­ri­ans would have paid for the women who the West Africans then use as drug mules. “We have about 200 Zim­bab­weans and the ma­jor­ity of the 200 are women, who are on death row in China be­cause they have been used by the so-called Nige­ri­ans, who are com­ing here, mar­ry­ing them through an Act that we en­acted in this House. They marry them and then ask them go to China to buy their wed­ding gowns,” said Cde Nyamupinga. “As they go to China to buy their wed­ding gowns, they are given a bag, which is called a false bot­tom and in that false bot­tom, there are drugs packed in there. They are told “when you get to China my friend is go­ing to re­ceive you and will show you the shops where you can buy your gown. She gets to China and the em­i­gra­tion and cus­toms of China know that and these girls are cap­tured and con­victed.” Cde Nyamupinga also said thou­sands of other women are stranded in other coun­tries af­ter be­ing promised lu­cra­tive jobs. “It is with a heavy heart that I rise to move a mo­tion on hu­man traf­fick­ing fol­low­ing the repa­tri­a­tion of around 53 out of 1,000 women be­lieved to have been traf­ficked to Kuwait. Not only Kuwait but to other coun­tries like China, other Arab coun­tries and in­clud­ing South Africa of all coun­tries,” said Cde Nyamupinga. “On this one, let me also add that these girls or the women who are be­ing traf­ficked, we have al­most 2,000 or over 1,000 that are roam­ing around in China as we speak right now. They were traf­ficked to China and some of them are now des­per­ate and stranded in China.” We find these rev­e­la­tions quite re­volt­ing con­sid­er­ing that the ma­jor­ity of these vic­tims are young women, some with fam­i­lies, while oth­ers have their whole lives ahead of them. We urge au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate these syn­di­cates who of­ten tar­get poor, young, un­em­ployed and vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple for their sor­did mis­sions. The modu­soperandi for Nige­rian drug traf­fick­ers is known through­out the un­der­world and the old trick of sneak­ing drugs into some­one’s lug­gage is a com­mon method that air­port au­thor­i­ties around the world are aware of. Zim­babwe has be­come a hot­bed for il­licit schemes such as hu­man and drug traf­fick­ing be­cause of the coun­try’s eco­nomic chal­lenges which have ex­posed its cit­i­zens to all kinds of scams. Con­victed Sin­ga­porean match-fixer Raj Peru­mal once re­vealed how easy it was to cor­rupt our coun­try’s foot­ball au­thor­i­ties and play­ers due to their poverty and we note the same traits in the lat­est hu­man and drug traf­fick­ing syn­di­cates. It is un­for­tu­nate that 200 of our cit­i­zens will lose their lives in a for­eign coun­try be­cause of their greed and vo­ra­cious ap­petite for a quick buck while their han­dlers go on with their lives as if noth­ing has hap­pened. Asian na­tions such as China, Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia and In­dia have strict anti-drug laws hence the ap­pli­ca­tion of the death penalty on any­one vi­o­lat­ing them. Drug deal­ers are aware of this hence their re­liance on mules to push their il­licit con­tra­band. We urge Zim­bab­weans to be wary of any­one promis­ing them in­stant riches for seem­ingly easy as­sign­ments. As for the women trapped in Kuwait, their plight has been helped im­mensely by the in­ter­ven­tion of leg­is­la­tors who blew the whis­tle on their sit­u­a­tion and mo­bilised fund­ing for their repa­tri­a­tion. Granted, some of them are still holed up in near slav­ery con­di­tions but we are hope­ful that ef­forts to bring them home will come to fruition. In the mean­time, we call on the gov­ern­ment to crack down on these syn­di­cates by iden­ti­fy­ing their lo­cal run­ners and bring­ing them to book.

The dis­pute has seen the two im­pose tar­iffs on hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars’ worth of one an­other’s goods. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has long ac­cused China of un­fair trad­ing prac­tices and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft. In China, there is a per­cep­tion that Amer­ica is try­ing to curb its rise as a global eco­nomic su­per­power. In light of this, The Sun­day Mail’s Kudzanai Sharara (KS) spoke with the IMF rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Zim­babwe, Pa­trick Imam (PI), to dis­cuss, among other things, the im­pact of trade dis­putes be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers as well as his views on the coro­n­avirus rav­aging China and also threat­en­ing other na­tions. The fol­low­ing are ex­cerpts of the dis­cus­sion. KS: What has been the im­pact of trade dis­putes be­tween the US, China and Europe so far on the global econ­omy? PI: Look, it is clear that trade and in­vest­ment re­stric­tions pose sig­nif­i­cant risks to the global econ­omy. Just look at the lat­est trade num­bers. Global goods trade was flat in the first half of 2019 and turned neg­a­tive from the third quar­ter on­wards. With de­mand con­tract­ing al­most ev­ery­where, no coun­try or eco­nomic group­ing has been spared from the slow­down on the ex­ports side. Most of­fi­cial data and trade-fi­nance trans­ac­tions con­tinue to con­firm weak­nesses. This out­come is not un­ex­pected, as higher un­cer­tainty adds to eco­nomic costs, such as through dis­tort­ing es­tab­lished global value chains. The dis­rup­tion will there­fore have a pro­nounced im­pact for de­vel­op­ing economies that are part of global value chains, es­pe­cially in the short run. Firms in those coun­tries would not be able to im­me­di­ately sub­sti­tute be­tween im­ported in­ter­me­di­ate in­puts as the prices on th­ese in­puts in­crease be­cause of tar­iffs. Trade also boosts the trans­fer of knowl­edge and technology across coun­tries, and there­fore leads to higher growth, em­ploy­ment and pro­duc­tiv­ity, es­pe­cially in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. So less trade will lead to less knowl­edge and technology trans­fer to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Now, I think it is fair to say that the trade con­flict has thus far largely failed to elicit the de­sired pol­icy re­forms. In­stead, trade re­stric­tions and pol­icy un­cer­tainty are weigh­ing in­creas­ingly on global ac­tiv­ity, and con­flict is spilling over to cur­rency, technology, and se­cu­rity is­sues. KS: How did th­ese ten­sions arise? What should be done to re­solve the trade ten­sions? PI: It’s im­por­tant to bear in mind that the trade dis­putes did not arise overnight. And it is im­por­tant to put the cur­rent trade ten­sions into their his­tor­i­cal con­text. The con­clu­sion of the Uruguay Round and cre­ation of the WTO in 1995 were ma­jor suc­cesses, but since then, progress has not kept pace. Many prob­lems are rooted in the in­abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to ad­dress old is­sues such as agri­cul­tural sub­si­dies and high tar­iffs for some prod­ucts as well as a fail­ure to make progress on new emerg­ing is­sues such as ser­vices and e-com­merce, for in­stance. There­fore, how on­go­ing ten­sions are re­solved will shape global trade for years to come, whether pos­i­tively or neg­a­tively. For a so­lu­tion to cur­rent ten­sions to be durable, it needs to be backed by a sta­ble and rules-based trad­ing sys­tem, which means get­ting back to the busi­ness of global trade agree­ments and WTO re­form. Co­op­er­a­tive and mar­ket-based so­lu­tions backed by stronger mul­ti­lat­eral rules are more likely to suc­ceed and en­dure, while man­aged trade so­lu­tions among ma­jor play­ers, such as those in the re­cently agreed China-U.S. Phase 1, are more likely frag­ment global trade and in­vest­ment and, with it, per­haps, the broader in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic sys­tem. KS: How can the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity en­sure that trade im­bal­ances do not serve as a cat­a­lyst for fu­ture po­lit­i­cal tur­moil and ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism? What should in­di­vid­ual coun­tries do? PI: This is a very per­ti­nent ques­tion. I would ar­gue that as a gen­eral prin­ci­ple, gov­ern­ments need to steer clear of pro­tec­tion­ism in all its forms. His­tory shows that im­port re­stric­tions hurt ev­ery­one, es­pe­cially poorer con­sumers. We need to be mind­ful of what hap­pened in the 1930s, when the forces of pro­tec­tion­ism and com­pet­i­tive cur­rency de­val­u­a­tion led to eco­nomic dis­as­ter for the world. Not only does pro­tec­tion­ism lead to more ex­pen­sive prod­ucts and more lim­ited choices, but it also pre­vents trade from play­ing its es­sen­tial role in boost­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity and spread­ing new tech­nolo­gies. As a re­sult, even pro­tected in­dus­tries even­tu­ally suf­fer as they be­come less dy­namic than their for­eign com­peti­tors. One ma­jor is­sue is that dis­cus­sions about trade re­stric­tions are of­ten bound up with the con­cept of trade deficits and sur­pluses. Some peo­ple wrongly ar­gue that th­ese im­bal­ances in­di­cate dis­tor­tionary trade prac­tices. Yes, it is true that there are dis­tor­tionary prac­tices, which should be elim­i­nated, and which can leave their mark on trade bal­ances be­tween two coun­tries. But, in gen­eral, th­ese bi­lat­eral im­bal­ances are a snap­shot of the di­vi­sion of labour across economies, in­clud­ing global value chains. For ex­am­ple, a coun­try that fo­cuses on as­sem­bling smart­phones will tend to have bi­lat­eral trade deficits with coun­tries that pro­duce the com­po­nents, and sur­pluses with coun­tries that buy the fin­ished devices. There­fore, un­fair trade prac­tices have lit­tle im­pact on a coun­try’s over­all trade deficit with the rest of the world. That im­bal­ance is driven by the fact that a coun­try spends more than its in­come. The best way to ad­dress th­ese macroe­co­nomic im­bal­ances is not to im­pose tar­iffs, but to use poli­cies that af­fect the econ­omy as a whole, such as fis­cal tools or struc­tural re­forms. The United States, for ex­am­ple, could help tackle ex­ces­sive global im­bal­ances by curb­ing grad­u­ally its pub­lic spend­ing and by in­creas­ing tax rev­enues. This should help re­duce its fis­cal deficits, and its cur­rent ac­count deficit. Ger­many, which ad­mit­tedly is fac­ing an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, could use its ex­cess sav­ings to boost its growth po­ten­tial, in­clud­ing through in­vest­ments in phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, which would help re­duce its cur­rent ac­count sur­plus. Gen­er­ally speak­ing, to im­prove the trade sys­tem each coun­try should look at its own prac­tices and com­mit to build­ing a more open, more sta­ble, and more trans­par­ent rules­based trad­ing sys­tem. It’s im­por­tant to re­mem­ber that the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem has trans­formed our world over the past gen­er­a­tion. It has re­duced the cost of liv­ing and has cre­ated mil­lions of new jobs with higher wages. It has helped re­duce by half the pro­por­tion of the global pop­u­la­tion liv­ing in ex­treme poverty. In ad­vanced economies, trade has re­duced the cost of liv­ing for a typ­i­cal high-in­come fam­ily by a quar­ter and it has re­duced that cost for a typ­i­cal low-in­come fam­ily by two-thirds. KS: How re­silient are mul­ti­lat eral in­sti­tu­tions of global trade gov­er­nance? Which re­forms are needed to ad­dress the widespread griev­ances re­gard­ing the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, in par­tic­u­lar the WTO and its dis­pute set­tle­ment mech­a­nism? PI: I’m glad that you men­tion the WTO’s dis­pute set­tle­ment mech­a­nism. Hav­ing a strong and ef­fec­tive dis­pute mech­a­nism in the WTO has brought greater trans­parency and sta­bil­ity to global trade re­la­tions and go­ing for­ward it is im­por­tant to sus­tain that. The de­tails are clearly for WTO mem­bers to ad­dress, but one must hope that they will re­solve the mat­ter promptly. The sense of ur­gency that we’re now see­ing around the idea of WTO re­form is wel­come. As I al­ready men­tioned, the sys­tem of trade rules es­tab­lished af­ter World War II gen­er­ated un­prece­dented growth in the global econ­omy and helped lift hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple from poverty. But now it needs to be up­dated. And this means we should fix the sys­tem, not throw it out. So con­cretely, we need col­lec­tive ac­tion to main­tain the ef­fec­tive dis­pute set­tle­ment and to com­pre­hen­sively mod­ernise the WTO’s ne­go­ti­a­tion and trans­parency func­tions. And here, three key themes are emerg­ing. First, it is im­por­tant to strengthen trade pol­icy mon­i­tor­ing and to en­cour­age greater trans­parency. This means strength­en­ing ex­ist­ing WTO rules on in­dus­trial and agri­cul­tural sub­si­dies for in­stance and en­sur­ing that they cover an ap­pro­pri­ately broad range of en­ti­ties, such as state-owned en­ter­prises. Strength­en­ing WTO rules as they ap­ply to technology trans­fer prac­tices and the en­force­ment of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights is also im­por­tant. Sec­ond, it’s cru­cial to main­tain the ef­fec­tive dis­pute set­tle­ment and re­solve the im­passe at the Ap­pel­late Body. This is par­tic­u­larly ur­gent. With­out a strong dis­pute set­tle­ment sys­tem, there will be lit­tle in­cen­tive to re­form other ar­eas of the WTO, and the risk is that we would be mov­ing to­wards the law of the jun­gle rather than hav­ing a sys­tem that re­lies on the rule of law. And third, mod­ernising the sys­tem through new mar­ket-open­ing agree­ments is cru­cial. This means ad­vanc­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions in emerg­ing ar­eas where WTO rules have lagged, like e-com­merce and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion. Progress in th­ese emerg­ing ar­eas would go far in demon­strat­ing that the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem can still de­liver new mar­ket-open­ing. The an­nounce­ment last year by a group of 76 coun­tries to be­gin WTO ne­go­ti­a­tions on e-com­merce at­tests to the great prom­ise of us­ing new modal­i­ties. KS: What will be the coro­n­avirus im­pact on global growth? PI: It is too early to quan­tify the eco­nomic im­pact it might have on China and the world. Much will de­pend on how the sit­u­a­tion can be con­tained. In the re­gion at the heart of the out­break in Hubei Prov­ince, eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity has slowed con­sid­er­ably. Hubei Prov­ince rep­re­sents about 5 per­cent of China’s GDP. There has al­ready been a short-term neg­a­tive im­pact on tourism and man­u­fac­tur­ing. If the virus re­treats quickly though, the eco­nomic im­pact will likely be small. This would be a sim­i­lar pat­tern to the SARS episode of two decades ago, where most ex­perts agree that an­nual growth took a rel­a­tively small hit at that time be­cause it was re­versed. The broader point, though, is that we live in an in­ter­con­nected world with many un­cer­tain­ties. We must strengthen poli­cies that build more re­silience to shocks. The em­pha­sis for ev­ery coun­try go­ing for­ward should be on pre­ven­tion, and on re­act­ing very fast should an­other out­break hap­pen.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160630,Boost­ing Sino-Africa me­dia co­op­er­a­tion,"Most Africans know China from the eyes of the Western me­dia lenses, inas­much as the Chi­nese know Africa from the same source. This has had an ef­fect on the at­ti­tude of the peo­ple and some­times hin­ders smooth progress in fur­ther­ing Si­noAfrica re­la­tions. CO­OP­ER­A­TION in the me­dia be­tween China and African coun­tries is a fairly re­cent devel­op­ment, but the scru­tiny it is al­ready at­tract­ing is mon­u­men­tal. Vol­umes of ar­ti­cles are be­ing churned out by pun­dits from var­i­ous parts of the world about this co­op­er­a­tion and what it en­tails. Some of the opin­ions have been help­ful in mod­el­ling the col­lab­o­ra­tion, while oth­ers seek to de­stroy it, com­pletely. But it has be­come clear that most of the pun­dits, es­pe­cially those from Western coun­tries, are un­set­tled by this kind of re­la­tion­ship. The strand that runs through their opin­ions is that China is at­tempt­ing to “colonise” Africa through use of the me­dia. Per­haps their ap­proach is be­ing in­flu­enced by their own ex­pe­ri­ences, es­pe­cially how Western me­dia has suc­cess­fully been used as a tool to help fash­ion the African’s mind. Not only has Western me­dia been used as a men­tal coloni­sa­tion tool in Africa, it has also been in­stru­men­tal in bring­ing strange life­styles and ideas to the con­ti­nent. There is gen­uine fear from some in the West that a strong bond be­tween Chi­nese and African me­dia will pose a great chal­lenge to the dom­i­nance of Western me­dia on the con­ti­nent. Let us face it - the un­de­ni­able fact is that Western me­dia has not been fair in its re­portage of both Africa and China. The two sides have been vic­tims of Western me­dia pro­pa­ganda to such an ex­tent that many peo­ple’s opin­ions, as gleaned from such out­lets, give a to­tally dif­fer­ent pic­ture. De­spite all its abundant nat­u­ral re­sources and hu­man cap­i­tal, Western me­dia take plea­sure in por­tray­ing Africa as a “hope­less” con­ti­nent. On the other hand, Western me­dia like to play up China’s per­ceived weak­nesses, while ig­nor­ing the colos­sal suc­cesses in its in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and the up­lift­ing of its pop­u­lace from poverty. Most Africans know China from the eyes of the Western me­dia lenses, inas­much as the Chi­nese know Africa from the same source. This has had an ef­fect on the at­ti­tude of the peo­ple and some­times hin­ders smooth progress in fur­ther­ing Sino-Africa re­la­tions. The re­al­ity, which must be ac­cepted, is that the Western me­dia will never change its stance on the por­trayal of both China and Africa. China is in­vest­ing mas­sively in Africa, with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping having set aside $60 bil­lion at the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion ( FOCAC) sum­mit in South Africa last year for the in­dus­tril­i­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent. The para­dox is that this huge sum is go­ing to be in­vested in com­mu­ni­ties which hold a neg­a­tive view of China be­cause of what they watch on TV and read in news­pa­pers. Is it not time that China-Africa me­dia co­op­er­a­tion is taken to a higher level? Well, this was the back­ground to the 3rd Fo­rum on China-Africa Me­dia Co­op­er­a­tion held here last week. The fo­rum was at­tended by more than 300 del­e­gates from 44 African coun­tries and sev­eral of their coun­ter­parts from China. In­for­ma­tion, Me­dia and Broad­cast­ing Ser­vices Min­is­ter Christo­pher Mushohwe was among sev­eral govern­ment min­is­ters from African coun­tries who at­tended the fo­rum. The pur­pose was to deepen Sino-Africa me­dia co­op­er­a­tion to help boost the devel­op­ment of re­la­tions be­tween the two sides. It was clear from dis­cus­sions at the fo­rum that there is a lot that China and Africa can learn from each other in the me­dia in­dus­try. But more im­por­tantly, the gen­eral ob­ser­va­tion was that China-Africa me­dia co­op­er­a­tion is not mov­ing as fast as stake­hold­ers would want. Com­par­isons were made be­tween the fast pace in eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion be­tween China and Africa and the “slow” pace in me­dia co­op­er­a­tion. Like I have al­luded to above, the world is now char­ac­terised by a lop­sided me­dia power sys­tem. Me­dia from “pow­er­ful” coun­tries tend to prop­a­gate prej­u­dice, mis­un­der­stand­ings and stereo­types about “weak” na­tions. This makes it an ur­gent mat­ter for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, led by China of course, to find ways of coun­ter­ing this un­fair sta­tus quo. China has been ca­pac­i­tat­ing the me­dia in Africa through var­i­ous means and what is needed is to take this no­ble ges­ture a step fur­ther. Sev­eral African jour­nal­ists have been granted an op­por­tu­nity to come to China for fur­ther train­ing, fa­mil­iari­sa­tion tours and fur­ther­ing their ed­u­ca­tion. The Asian coun­try has since es­tab­lished the China-Africa Press Cen­tre which takes jour­nal­ists from Africa to stay and work in China for 10 months each year. The project is in its sec­ond year, with 28 African jour­nal­ists from 27 coun­tries tak­ing part. China has also been help­ing ca­pac­i­tate var­i­ous me­dia houses in African coun­tries with the pro­vi­sion of the lat­est tech­nolo­gies. The other ad­van­tage is that China’s me­dia pres­ence is al­ready be­ing felt in many African coun­tries. In Zim­babwe, for ex­am­ple, the Asian coun­try’s news agency, Xin­hua, has a full bu­reau em­ploy­ing Zim­bab­wean jour­nal­ists. News from the in­ter­na­tion­ally re­spected news agency fea­ture promi­nently in African me­dia on a daily ba­sis. And for some time now, China Ra­dio In­ter­na­tional has been rid­ing the African air waves and has been send­ing at least two cor­re­spon­dents to Zim­babwe at a time. CCTV’s pres­ence is felt in many African coun­tries where it has ei­ther full bu­reaus or freelance jour­nal­ists. China Daily, the largest Chi­nese news­pa­per in English, has since es­tab­lished a weekly ver­sion for Africa called Africa Weekly. All this pro­vides a ba­sis for the two sides to come up with a mega me­dia strat­egy that can squarely chal­lenge the pro­pa­ganda be­ing churned out by the Western me­dia. While this pres­ence of Chi­nese me­dia in Africa is most wel­come, it is also im­por­tant that ef­forts are made to en­sure African me­dia open bureaux in China. This will en­sure that Africans tell the story of China from their ex­pe­ri­ences in the coun­try, inas­much as the Chi­nese are al­ready telling the story of Africa from Africa. Per­haps this ex­plains why Min­is­ter Mushohwe re­ceived a stand­ing ova­tion af­ter de­liv­er­ing his speech at the China-Africa Me­dia Co­op­er­a­tion. “. . . we should be­gin to see in­creased African me­dia pres­ence in China so that they tell the Chi­nese story to the African peo­ple. “Such a devel­op­ment would help African com­mu­ni­ties bet­ter un­der­stand Chi­nese cul­ture and the work ethics of the Chi­nese African en­ter­prises that are in­creas­ingly estab­lish­ing and op­er­at­ing on the African con­ti­nent.” It is clear that the Chi­nese me­dia is much more vis­i­ble in Africa now, but the vis­i­bil­ity of African me­dia in China is min­i­mal. Yet the need to chal­lenge the nar­ra­tive of both China and Africa as pre­sented by Western me­dia is much more crit­i­cal now than at any other time. And this could be the op­por­tu­nity for China and Africa to start think­ing se­ri­ously on ef­fec­tive ways of coun­ter­ing Western pro­pa­ganda. The Fo­rum on China-Africa Me­dia Co­op­er­a­tion is an ap­pro­pri­ate plat­form for the for­mu­la­tion of such a grand strat­egy.",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191017,‘Zim­babwe should fur­ther ben­e­fi­ci­ate and add value to min­er­als’,"ZIM­BABWE needs to fur­ther ben­e­fi­ci­ate and value add min­er­als in or­der to de­rive max­i­mum ben­e­fits from its pre­cious re­source as well as achieve sus­tain­able growth in line with the Africa Min­ing Vi­sion's ( AMV) ob­jec­tives. The re­gion, and Zim­babwe in par­tic­u­lar is en­dowed with vast min­eral re­sources, ac­count­ing for in­stance the se­cond largest chrome re­serves in the world af­ter South Africa. But, there hasn't been much to show for it, es­pe­cially the sur­round­ing com­mu­ni­ties that still live in poverty as re­sources have been ex­ported mainly as ores and con­cen­trates without much value ad­di­tion. One of the ob­jec­tives of the AMV is to en­sure Africa gets max­i­mum ben­e­fits from the rich min­eral wealth it holds. In Zim­babwe, Gov­ern­ment has em­pha­sised on value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion as op­posed to ex­port­ing min­er­als in their raw form. That way, Mines and Min­ing Devel­op­ment Deputy Min­is­ter Po­lite Kam­ba­mura said, will en­sure more jobs are cre­ated as well as more for­eign cur­rency earn­ings. “Africa min­ing vi­sion says that we should mine re­source sus­tain­ably, there should be eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of min­eral re­sources with the com­mu­nity,” he said in an in­ter­view in Gweru re­cently. “One thing im­por­tant to note is that we are sur­rounded by great wealth but most of the com­mu­ni­ties are in deep poverty. “We need t o know ex­actly t he re­sources that we have be­cause some­times we ne­go­ti­ate con­tracts for what we re­ally don't know and in the end it ben­e­fits their own coun­tries at the ex­pense of the lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties. “In line with this, there is need to ben­e­fi­ci­ate, come up with poli­cies that make it a re­quire­ment to value add the re­sources and then ex­port raw min­er­als,” he said. Ac­cord­ing to the AMV, af­ter gain­ing in­de­pen­dence, most African coun­tries made lit­tle progress to in­te­grate their min­eral wealth with their economies with the ex­cep­tion of a few due to partly global price fluc­tu­a­tions as well as poli­cies that were not favourable to the re­gion. How­ever, ris­ing de­mand from China and the rest of Asia cre­ated hope for the re­gion to start ben­e­fit­ing from the min­eral re­sources and this needed an AMV and strate­gies to im­ple­ment and achieve this turn­around. From the AMV, the min­ing sec­tor is seen as a key en­abler for eco­nomic up­turn as it should catal­yse broad- based growth and devel­op­ment in the re­gion as it is ex­pected to sup­port the Africa's in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion agenda. Among the key ar­eas of op­por­tu­ni­ties to sup­port this are re­source rents, which is “the use of re­source dif­fer­en­tial and wind­fall rents to im­prove the ba­sic phys­i­cal and knowl­edge in­fra­struc­ture of the na­tion through in­vest­ment in phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and so­cial and hu­man in­fra­struc­ture”. An­other key as­pect is down­stream and up­stream value ad­di­tion that is to es­tab­lish re­source- pro­cess­ing in­dus­tries that could then pro­vide the feed­stock for man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. That way, the re­gion will ben­e­fit in more j obs, im­proved in­fra­struc­ture while prod­ucts will fetch more for­eign cur­rency as op­posed to ore ex­ports. “Africa needs to stop be­ing a source of raw ma­te­ri­als to a source of value added, ben­e­fi­ci­ated prod­ucts. We need to man­u­fac­ture and ex­port fin­ished goods. “For in­stance, what is hap­pen­ing here with chrome smelters, at this point we ex­port law car­bon fer­rochrome, high car­bon fer­rochrome, fer­rosil­i­con but we need to ben­e­fi­ci­ate fur­ther into stain­less steel and stain­less steel prod­ucts, we need to get max­i­mum ben­e­fits for our prod­ucts,” said Deputy Min­is­ter Kam­ba­mura. Gov­ern­ment has em­pha­sised to min­ing com­pa­nies to value add and ben­e­fi­ci­ate. It has en­cour­aged min­ing firms to es­tab­lish re­finer­ies in the coun­try and pro­posed a 15 per­cent tax on raw plat­inum ex­ports in 2013. This is ex­pected to pro­mote value ad­di­tion, job cre­ation and more for­eign cur­rency from ex­port of pro­cessed min­er­als as op­posed to their raw for­mat.",津巴布韦

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20201108,Biden win brings re­lief for all,"THE likely and im­mi­nent con­fir­ma­tion of Joseph Biden as the next president of the United States is of in­ter­est to all govern­ments and coun­tries, not just to the peo­ple of the US, con­sid­er­ing the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal weight the US pulls glob­ally. Africa in gen­eral, and Zim­babwe in par­tic­u­lar, will find the change re­fresh­ing. For the past four years we have ei­ther been ig­nored by an in­tensely in­ward-look­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion, or have been at the re­ceiv­ing end of ill-con­sid­ered state­ments and poli­cies. So hav­ing a US president who at least recog­nises the global re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the US, as well as its mus­cle, and who be­lieves in di­plo­macy to help solve global prob­lems will be a re­lief for all. In one key area, cli­mate change, we can ex­pect a ma­jor shift with a president who ac­tu­ally be­lieves the gen­eral sci­en­tific con­sen­sus and has an­nounced that his first for­eign pol­icy move will be to re­join the Paris Agree­ment, the global treaty that com­mits most of the world to ef­fec­tive and prac­ti­cal mea­sures to limit global warm­ing. This is im­por­tant for Africa, a con­ti­nent that will be harder hit than most by global warm­ing but re­quires sup­port, even if this is just ac­cess to tech­nol­ogy, if it is to bring its peo­ple out of poverty with­out wreck­ing the planet. Cli­mate change ap­pears to be ac­cel­er­at­ing, as what we have al­ready pumped into the at­mos­phere does its worst, but the world can only step back from the brink if ma­jor in­dus­trial pow­ers switch to greener en­ergy and if the poorer coun­tries are able to in­dus­tri­alise with green tech­nolo­gies. China and the European Union are both com­mit­ted to the dual ap­proach and the re­turn of the US to the process will mean we now have a chance. The bat­tle against Covid-19, which has to be a global bat­tle, has been slip­ping, partly be­cause the US de­clared it­self against the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and wanted to fol­low a min­i­mal­ist ap­proach. Again, hav­ing a US president who ac­tu­ally trusts sci­en­tific con­sen­sus and is pre­pared to take ac­tion helps. Even if this is limited to clean­ing up the mess in the present cen­tre of the global epi­demic, the USA it­self, it will be a ma­jor gain but adding a sig­nif­i­cant block of the world’s sci­en­tific and med­i­cal tal­ent back to the bat­tle will help us all. In other ar­eas Africa has to re­mem­ber that the job of US president is to advance the needs and in­ter­ests of that coun­try. Mr Biden will be the leader of the USA. But hav­ing a US president who re­spects di­plo­macy, who ac­cepts that the rest of the world ex­ists and has its own in­ter­ests, and is will­ing to craft mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial deals is a ma­jor ad­van­tage. African diplo­mats, and for that mat­ter African business peo­ple, can at least have their voice heard. A lot of progress on trade and mu­tual business was stymied or fell back over the last four years, and the will­ing­ness of an Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion to de­clare trade wars helped no one, least of all Amer­i­cans. An Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion that recog­nises that global eco­nomic growth is not a zero-sum game but rather the cre­ation of new mar­kets and new con­sumers that ev­ery­one can tap into will be a wel­come part­ner. Just look­ing at one sim­plis­tic point, if Africa was richer then Africans would be buy­ing more Amer­i­can stuff, even if our de­vel­op­ment does see us mak­ing more of our own goods. When Amer­i­cans, for ex­am­ple, com­plain about China they some­times for­get that a far richer China is spend­ing a lot more money in Amer­ica than it did when it was a poor de­vel­op­ing coun­try. And it will be the same for Africa. One of the trick­i­est points for Zim­babwe will be zdera, that Amer­i­can Act of 2001 and amended in 2018, that con­trols most of the US sanc­tions against Zim­babwe, es­pe­cially the big sanc­tions that make our ac­cess to global de­vel­op­ment agen­cies and in­ter­na­tional finance dif­fi­cult. Here we will need to en­gage the fair­ness of a President Biden and rely on the fact that he is not an ego­ist un­able to re­con­sider. Among the five spon­sors of the orig­i­nal 2001 Act was one of the two sen­a­tors from Delaware, Sen Joseph R. Biden Jnr. So first we will be deal­ing with a US president who knows what we are talk­ing about, and sec­ondly our diplo­mats are go­ing to have to take the re-en­gage­ment pol­icy to new lev­els. Pos­si­bly the most pos­i­tive ap­proach we can take is to point out that the con­di­tions set in the 2001 Act and changed in the 2018 amend­ment no longer ap­ply since we have been clean­ing up our own prob­lems in our own way. Since President Mnan­gagwa was sworn into of­fice in late 2017, and es­pe­cially since he achieved his own man­date and moved the Zim­bab­wean re­form pro­gramme into over­drive from the 2018 elec­tions with the Sec­ond Repub­lic, we have been sort­ing our­selves out. The re­forms, changes, new poli­cies and the like have not been be­cause of in­ter­na­tional pres­sure. That we must make clear. They have been done be­cause this is what Zim­bab­weans want and Zim­bab­weans need, and we do not need to be told what we want and need. But we have been fix­ing our eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals, sign­ing a very fair agree­ment with the white for­mer farm­ers in land re­form, or at least those who de­vel­oped their farms, hunt­ing down the cor­rupt, open­ing up our me­dia space and junk­ing ill-con­sid­ered laws, to­tally re­vamp­ing our elec­tion pro­cesses and gov­er­nance prac­tices, and now start­ing that care­ful process of heal­ing in­ter­nal wounds. Be­cause all these pro­cesses are lo­cal, driven by our own re­quire­ments, they will not fol­low chap­ter and verse of the zdera con­di­tions. But the gen­eral re­sult is roughly the same. Al­ready For­eign Min­is­ter Dr Sibusiso Moyo has been do­ing ster­ling work in en­gag­ing the pro­fes­sional diplo­mats in the Amer­i­can State Depart­ment, cut­ting out the rhetoric and deal­ing with prac­ti­cal­i­ties, point by point, and gain­ing recog­ni­tion that we are clean­ing up our act. We can now build on that ap­proach, es­pe­cially with the sup­port of our neigh­bours who have been telling ev­ery­one who mat­ters that we are a func­tion­ing, eco­nom­i­cally-sta­ble democ­racy. So the ad­vent of a new Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­babwe and for Africa. We can­not, and will not, get ev­ery­thing we want or need. But at the very least we can have our voices heard. Deals are now pos­si­ble and as a con­ti­nent and coun­try we need to make sure that these voices are smart and com­mit­ted peo­ple who can show the Amer­i­can ad­min­is­tra­tion where mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial progress can be made and un­fair­ness elim­i­nated.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20151211,Xi’s visit and China’s grow­ing role in Africa,"CHI­NESE Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s visit to Zim­babwe last week was his­toric in that it is only the sec­ond visit to the coun­try by a sit­ting Chi­nese pres­i­dent in al­most 20 years. The first Chi­nese leader to visit the coun­try was Jiang Zemin in 1996. The visit was sig­nif­i­cant for Zim­babwe and re­flects the close ties be­tween the two na­tions. China, the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world with GDP of US$10,4 tril­lion, ac­counts for over 16,7% of the world econ­omy. China was once con­sid­ered to be a poor coun­try with a com­bined GDP of US$46,7 bil­lion in 1962. China’s per capita GDP was less than US$100 in 1962 com­pared to over US$7 500 to­day. China’s suc­cess over the last 50 years has been phe­nom­e­nal. By con­trast, Zim­babwe is con­sid­ered one of the poor­est coun­tries in the world with per capita GDP of less than US$1 000 and GDP of around US$12bn. Nev­er­the­less, China has main­tained close ties with Zim­babwe and is an im­por­tant trad­ing part­ner and source of FDI. China has in­vested over US$1,5bn in for­eign direct in­vest­ment (FDI) in Zim­babwe and has im­ported over US$1,7bn while ex­port­ing US$600 mil­lion. There is no doubt that China plays an im­por­tant role in the de­vel­op­ment of Zim­babwe. The even­tual out­come of the visit and the 12 me­gadeals an­nounced, re­mains to be seen. Xi was en-route to South Africa to at­tend the sixth Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Focac) Sum­mit, a tri-an­nual sum­mit jointly con­vened by China and the Africa Union. The first Focac sum­mit, held in 2000 in Beijing, fo­cused on build­ing po­lit­i­cal links be­tween China and Africa and en­cour­ag­ing Chi­nese firms to in­vest in the con­ti­nent. Only four African pres­i­dents at­tended the event, with most states send­ing min­is­te­rial rep­re­sen­ta­tives. Rel­a­tively few eco­nomic deals were con­cluded, though Beijing did agree to an aid for­give­ness pack­age. Sub­se­quent meet­ings, how­ever, have been more fo­cused on eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial ties. This is per­haps un­sur­pris­ing, given the six­teen-fold in­crease in China-Africa trade that has occurred since the first Focac meet­ing. Trade be­tween Africa and China has grown from less than US$2bn in 2000 to over US$30bn in 2015. The fo­rum has since been up­graded to a full po­lit­i­cal sum­mit, and 36 pres­i­dents were ex­pected to at­tend this year’s event. The sum­mit model has been widely copied with New Delhi or­gan­is­ing its own In­dia-Africa Fo­rum sum­mits in 2008 — the most re­cent of which, held last month, at­tracted 48 heads of state and gov­ern­ment. The first USAfrica sum­mit was held in Au­gust 2014, while France, Ja­pan and the Euro­pean Union have also held sim­i­lar meet­ings. Beijing’s Focac re­mains, how­ever, the most high-pro­file sum­mit. At each fo­rum since the 2006 meet­ing, China has dou­bled its fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment, which rose to US$20bn at the 2012 Beijing sum­mit. This year Xi pledged US$60 bil­lion of fund­ing sup­port, which com­prises US$5bn of grant and in­ter­est-free loans, US$35bn of pref­er­en­tial loans and ex­port credit, US$5bn each for ad­di­tional cap­i­tal for the China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund and the Spe­cial Loan for the De­vel­op­ment of African SMEs, and a China-Africa Pro­duc­tion Ca­pac­ity Co-op­er­a­tion Fund with an ini­tial cap­i­tal of US$10bn. Last week Xi an­nounced 10 pri­or­ity pro­grammes aimed at ad­dress­ing three of the pri­mary bot­tle­necks hin­der­ing Africa’s de­vel­op­ment, namely the lack of in­fra­struc­ture, skilled per­son­nel and fund­ing. The 10 ini­tia­tives, specif­i­cally iden­ti­fied for co­op­er­a­tion over the next three years, in­clude, in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, fi­nance, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty erad­i­ca­tion and peo­ple’s well-be­ing, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple and cul­tural ex­changes, and peace and se­cu­rity. Whilst the Focac sum­mit will re­sult in some sig­nif­i­cant new agree­ments, the meet­ing’s im­por­tance is of­ten ex­ag­ger­ated in the me­dia. Firstly, “fi­nanc­ing” is not aid, but rather loans that will have to be re­paid. Of the US$60bn an­nounced at the re­cent Focac Sum­mit only US$5bn is in the form of aid or in­ter­est free loans. It is worth not­ing, how­ever, that such fi­nanc­ing guar­an­tees adds to cap­i­tal in­flows with­out in­creas­ing Africa’s debt bur­den. Se­condly, China’s eco­nomic in­flu­ence on Africa is fre­quently over­stated. Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa’s ex­ports to Europe ex­ceed US$90bn while ex­ports to China are less than US$60bn per an­num. Thirdly, eco­nomic ties be­tween China and Africa are not, as is of­ten as­sumed, tightly con­trolled by Beijing. While some eco­nomic links be­tween China and Africa are planned strate­gi­cally by large, state-owned en­ter­prises, the ma­jor­ity of FDI projects are now run by small, pri­vate firms. In 2002, around 90% of Chi­nese FDI projects in Africa were driven by the state. By 2013 more than 50% of Chi­nese FDI to Africa was driven by the pri­vate sec­tor. The re­cent Focac sum­mit pro­vides a clear sign that China-Africa eco­nomic links re­main strong, even in the face of fears of a Chi­nese slow­down. Xi’s an­nounce­ment of US$60bn in fi­nanc­ing for the con­ti­nent is no doubt sig­nif­i­cant. How­ever, the meet­ing does not play the de­ter­mi­na­tive role in China-Africa links that is of­ten as­sumed. Ties be­tween the two economies are in­creas­ingly com­plex and un­likely to be mi­cro-man­aged by a two-day sum­mit. There is no doubt that China is a close friend and ally of Zim­babwe, but the Asian gi­ant is cer­tainly not a char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion. China will con­tinue to sup­port Zim­babwe as long as we re­main an im­por­tant source of nat­u­ral re­sources.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161026,"Achiev­ing SDGs re­quires strong, ra­tio­nal im­ple­men­ta­tion","ON Oc­to­ber 24, we celebrated the 71st an­niver­sary of the United Na­tions to­gether with over 300 part­ners in­clud­ing Gov­ern­ment min­is­ters, UN heads of agen­cies, am­bas­sadors, heads of NGOs, the me­dia, civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions, tra­di­tional lead­ers, rep­re­sen­ta­tives of pri­vate sec­tor and young peo­ple in a truly global spirit. The day al­lowed tak­ing stock of our year-long en­gage­ment in the de­vel­op­ment and hu­man­i­tar­ian spheres in Zim­babwe. Dur­ing the course of 2016, a broad­based na­tional coali­tion for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) was es­tab­lished. Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans have taken the lead in leg­is­lat­ing for SDGs friendly laws, and Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment (Pro­vin­cial and Dis­trict Level) have com­mit­ted to ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of SDGs pro­grammes on the ground. Young peo­ple in schools, uni­ver­si­ties, and in their as­so­ci­a­tions have been play­ing their role in SDGs ad­vo­cacy on­line and off­line, whilst on the other hand tra­di­tional lead­ers have started mo­bil­is­ing com­mu­ni­ties into ac­tion. The me­dia has long been on board set­ting the agenda of pub­lic dis­course for a mean­ing­ful and ob­jec­tive di­a­logue on SDGs. Go­ing for­ward, we need to in­crease the mo­men­tum on our com­mit­ment that “no one is left be­hind” in the quest to end poverty, hunger and pro­tect the planet, as well as ful­fill­ing the as­pi­ra­tions of SDG 16 — en­sur­ing peace, jus­tice and strong in­sti­tu­tions for all. For all this im­ple­men­ta­tion will be key. Such com­mit­ment to ac­tion on SDGs was re­cently re­it­er­ated by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe at the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly, where he em­pha­sised that there should be no half mea­sures and no com­pro­mises in achiev­ing all the 17 Goals. In line with this com­mit­ment, in the first year of the 2016-2020 Zim­babwe UN De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Frame­work (ZUNDAF) im­ple­men­ta­tion, the UN has been on tar­get in de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme sup­port, ex­cept some ar­eas such as poverty re­duc­tion that re­quire ad­di­tional re­sources. I am glad to note that em­pha­sis has been put in this area and the Gov­ern­ment has re­cently launched its In­terim Poverty Re­duc­tion Strat­egy for the pe­riod of 2016-2018 that will guide na­tional ef­forts to re­duce poverty. The ZUNDAF pri­ori­tises the UN’s sup­port in ar­eas of food and nu­tri­tion se­cu­rity, gen­der equal­ity, HIV and AIDS, poverty re­duc­tion and value ad­di­tion, pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion and gov­er­nance, and so­cial ser­vices and pro­tec­tion. For ex­am­ple, in part­ner­ship with the de­vel­op­ment part­ners and the Global Funds, the pro­gramme on HIV and AIDS is cur­rently pro­vid­ing treat­ment to 915 000 Zim­bab­weans, re­sult­ing in steady re­duc­tion of preva­lence rate. The pro­gramme on re­pro­duc­tive, ma­ter­nal, neona­tal, child and ado­les­cent health helped Zim­babwe to re­duce the ma­ter­nal mor­tal­ity by 50 per­cent in the last 5 years. The UN con­tin­ues to sup­port the ad­vance­ment of hu­man rights and rule of law, in­clud­ing through the Uni­ver­sal Pe­ri­odic Re­view process and ca­pac­i­tat­ing in­de­pen­dent na­tional bod­ies, such as the Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion, Gen­der Com­mis­sion, Na­tional heal­ing, Peace and Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion Com­mis­sion, and the Zim­babwe Elec­toral Com­mis­sion. The UN is com­mit­ted to do more in sup­port­ing and strength­en­ing th­ese in­de­pen­dent na­tional watch­dogs and var­i­ous other de­vel­op­ment, hu­man rights and demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions. In our col­lec­tive re­sponse to the pre­vail­ing drought sit­u­a­tion, un­der the lead­er­ship of the Gov­ern­ment, the UN and NGOs, to­gether with donors such as the USA, UK, China, EU, Nether­lands, Ja­pan — to name but a few — have demon­strated strong sol­i­dar­ity in al­le­vi­at­ing the threat of hunger. Of the to­tal $352 mil­lion ap­peal made for the pe­riod April 2016 to March 2017, with gen­er­ous sup­port from donors to the tune of $206 mil­lion, the UN and NGOs have reached 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple who are most in need. The re­sponse is ex­pected to reach 3.1 mil­lion peo­ple at the peak of the lean sea­son. Our as­sis­tance is tar­geted to the most vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties in line with the uni­ver­sal hu­man­i­tar­ian prin­ci­ples of hu­man­ity, neu­tral­ity, in­de­pen­dence and im­par­tial­ity. The world over, in­clud­ing in Zim­babwe, the lines be­tween hu­man­i­tar­ian and de­vel­op­ment needs are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly blurred by the ef­fects of cli­mate change. In or­der to counter and mit­i­gate the high in­ci­dences of re­cur­rent drought in Zim­babwe, we need to in­vest in tack­ling its root causes through agri­cul­tural re­form, ir­ri­ga­tion, wa­ter har­vest­ing and man­age­ment for longer term im­pact. Over the years it has been demon­strated that tra­di­tional de­vel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tion is not enough to achieve sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. In this re­gard, a three points can be em­pha­sised that could fur­ther accelerate trans­for­ma­tion and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment: First, con­tin­ued ef­fort to pro­mote re­form and es­tab­lish right pol­icy en­vi­ron­ment premised on rule of law and re­spect for hu­man rights — re­mem­ber­ing al­ways that women’s rights are hu­man rights — are the most crit­i­cally im­por­tant pre-req­ui­sites for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment and con­tin­ued strong part­ner­ship. Se­cond, con­tin­ued ef­fort to strength­en­ing pub­lic sec­tor in­sti­tu­tions to de­liver qual­ity ser­vices, to com­bat cor­rup­tion and en­sure ad­e­quate checks and balances are in place, as well as fos­ter ef­fi­cient fi­nan­cial mar­ket and in­vest­ment in skills de­vel­op­ment to boost small and medium en­ter­prises. Third, the ef­fect of cli­mate change and other shocks are in­creas­ingly af­fect­ing liveli­hoods and well-being of the poor and vul­ner­a­ble. The growing so­cial and eco­nomic vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties among the ma­jor­ity of the Zim­bab­weans would re­quire for Zim­babwe to cal­i­brate its ef­forts for green and re­new­able en­ergy, and a well-ar­tic­u­lated so­cial pro­tec­tion mech­a­nism to cater for the most vul­ner­a­ble. End­ing poverty is pos­si­ble even un­der dif­fi­cult con­di­tions if we fo­cus on build­ing re­silience, in­vest in ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties and em­power the youth. This can be done if we pull to­gether in the spirit of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and global part­ner­ship with the Gov­ern­ment on the driv­ing seat.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170316,"China, the Asian gi­ant that thrives on unity of pur­pose","WHEN I ar­rived in Bei­jing, China, for a 10- month pro­gramme in Fe­bru­ary last year, one of my hosts asked me what I thought about the coun­try. I fum­bled some­thing to the ef­fect that most of what I knew was from “book” knowl­edge, with the main source be­ing news sup­plied by West­ern me­dia. One of the Chi­nese of­fi­cials on the pro­gramme, Mr Pan Xiaoguang, as­sured me that my views would have to­tally changed by the end of the 10 months stay. I did not be­lieve him sim­ply be­cause I thought there was noth­ing re­ally new for me to dis­cover in China. Per­haps this sort of ar­ro­gance was driven by that I had been to Bei­jing, the cap­i­tal of China, on sev­eral oc­ca­sions be­fore, al­beit for a few days at a time. The vis­its were mainly part of the me­dia co­op­er­a­tion and ex­change pro­grammes between China and Africa, with two of them as a stu­dent of the Con­fu­cius In­sti­tute. But I would soon dis­cover that in­deed I had a su­per­fi­cial knowl­edge of China. This time I was back in Bei­jing for a longer pe­riod un­der an in­sti­tute called China-Africa Press Cen­tre, which is part of the China Pub­lic Diplo­macy As­so­ci­a­tion run by the Chi­nese For­eign Af­fairs Min­istry. The in­sti­tute is part of the ful­fil­ment of the aims and goals of the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion, and it takes in jour­nal­ists from Africa and af­fords them a chance to learn and work in China for 10 months. This lat­est pro­gramme of­fered me enough time and ac­tiv­i­ties to know China bet­ter, and it to­tally changed my per­cep­tion of the Asian gi­ant. The pro­gramme in­volved vis­it­ing sev­eral provinces and cities of China, un­like in my past vis­its when I stayed in Bei­jing. The ever last­ing im­pres­sion of China that I got is that it is a na­tion that is pro­gress­ing rapidly, yet is hum­ble enough to main­tain the tag of a de­vel­op­ing coun­try. Al­most ev­ery­where you go in China, there are sky­scrapers, which sig­nify boom­ing busi­ness in the Asian coun­try.

With the Com­mu­nist Party of China ac­count­ing for only 87 mil­lion mem­bers out of a pop­u­la­tion of nearly 1,3 bil­lion, one would think that all the other peo­ple have noth­ing to do with govern­ment-ori­ented pro­grammes. Yet, all Chi­nese peo­ple sing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to de­vel­op­men­tal pro­grammes. There is no an­tag­o­nism; be­cause the project would have been ini­ti­ated by the CPC, ev­ery­one pulls in the same di­rec­tion. Once the project is pro­posed, it be­comes a na­tional is­sue and ev­ery­one rel­e­vant to the job at hand plays their part whole­heart­edly, de­spite not be­ing mem­bers of the rul­ing party. China is a land of abun­dant op­por­tu­ni­ties and the govern­ment en­sures that ev­ery­one gets their chance, be it in ed­u­ca­tion, arts, sci­ence or any other field. Many peo­ple think that China is a “closed” so­ci­ety. But my stay re­vealed a more open so­ci­ety, where young peo­ple have the op­por- tu­nity to pur­sue their dreams in what­ever field, in­clud­ing mov­ing along with fash­ion­able trends. I dis­cov­ered that the Chi­nese are very proud of their coun­try in ev­ery as­pect, with a very huge sense of na­tion­al­ism sweep­ing across the na­tion. Once they en­counter a for­eigner, those who can speak for­eign lan­guages are quick to ask if you have vis­ited some of the his­toric sites ei­ther in Bei­jing or out­side. If you are in Bei­jing, it’s com­mon to be stopped on the streets and asked: “Have you been to the Great Wall?, Have you been to Tianan­men Square?, Have you been to the For­bid­den City? or “Have you been to the Sum­mer Palace?” All these are places with his­toric rel­e­vance to China’s na­tion­al­ism and State­hood. Com­ing from a small coun­try such as Zim­babwe, the sheer num­bers of peo­ple on the streets of Chi­nese cities are over­whelm­ing. Yet, with so many peo­ple out there at the same time, one rarely en­coun­ters petty crim­i­nals like pick pock­ets! In fact, there is so much safety in China that one can walk across the city at any time with­out fear of be­ing mugged or mur­dered.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200719,‘Con­struc­tion of car­bon steel plant be­gins in 2021’,"RES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa was in Hwange last week on a two-day work­ing visit of coal and cok­ing projects. The ven­tures are primed to spur an industrial rev­o­lu­tion for Zim­babwe in line with Government’s quest to achieve up­per mid­dle-in­come sta­tus by 2030. They are also likely to con­trib­ute to the de­vel­op­ment of the min­ing sec­tor into a US$12 bil­lion in­dus­try by 2023. As the Pres­i­dent noted dur­ing his visit, the projects will cul­mi­nate in Zim­babwe mov­ing from the cur­rent state of im­port­ing power to be­ing a net ex­porter by 2023, as dif­fer­ent pri­vate sec­tor play­ers im­ple­ment power gen­er­a­tion projects that will feed into the na­tional grid. As the Pres­i­dent learnt dur­ing the tour, cok­ing coal pro­duc­tion is also poised for a ma­jor boost and will go a long way in feed­ing into the lo­cal steel mak­ing in­dus­try and the ex­port market. Cru­cially, the projects also feed into Government’s de­vo­lu­tion strat­egy of grow­ing the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) of the coun­try’s prov­inces. Dur­ing the tour, Government also took the op­por­tu­nity to re­it­er­ate the “use it or lose it” prin­ci­ple, which is aimed at weed­ing out op­por­tunists that hold on to min­eral-rich ti­tle for spec­u­la­tive pur­poses while lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties con­tinue to wal­low in poverty. The Pres­i­dent was ac­com­pa­nied on the tour by sev­eral Cabi­net min­is­ters, among them Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Win­ston Chi­tando, who spoke to our busi­ness re­porter ISHEMUNYORO CHINGWERE at the end of the tour and gave a sum­mary of the Pres­i­dent’s his­toric work­ing visit to these projects. *** by His Ex­cel­lency Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. The first leg (on Thurs­day) was at Lo­calised Western Ar­eas, which is a new mine that will be feed­ing ther­mal coal to ZESA (Zim­babwe Elec­tric­ity Sup­ply Au­thor­ity). They are set to con­struct a 600MW power sta­tion and pro­duce cok­ing coal, which they will sup­ply to var­i­ous coke works in Hwange. His Ex­cel­lency also vis­ited South Min­ing, a new coke works which is in two phases. The first phase is what the Pres­i­dent of­fi­cially com­mis­sioned, which is a 150 000 tonnes per an­num coke bat­tery. They will be un­der­tak­ing a sec­ond phase of an­other 150 000 tonnes coke bat­tery. There­after, His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited Ji­nan, which is a very in­ter­est­ing model in the sense that they have got a mine they are open­ing and on that mine they are putting up a 600MW power sta­tion. Ji­nan is also then con­struct­ing a 300 000tonne coke bat­tery which His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited. Be­yond that, they have con­structed smelters in Gweru for the pro­duc­tion of fer­rochrome, fer­rosil­i­con chrome and low-car­bon fer­rochrome. They are also putting a lime plant in Bu­l­awayo and also putting up an ex­plo­sive fac­tory in Lala­panzi. It is an in­te­grated busi­ness model. His Ex­cel­lency also went to Chaba Mine, which is one of the two open pit op­er­a­tions of Hwange Col­liery Com­pany. To­day (Fri­day) the day started with a visit to Din­son Col­liery, a com­pany owned by Ts­ing­shan, and if you re­call in 2018, His Ex­cel­lency met the share­hold­ers of Ts­ing­shan in China. That meet­ing cul­mi­nated in the sign­ing of an agree­ment for the es­tab­lish­ment of a stain­less steel plant. For stain­less steel, the ma­jor in­puts are fer­rochrome, coke and iron ore. What has since hap­pened in terms of that agree­ment is that Afro­chine in Selous have put in ad­di­tional fur­naces — they now have five. They then started con­struc­tion of a 300 000-tonne coke bat­tery, which His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited to­day, to pre­pare the ground WE have come to the end of a two-day visit of coal and coke projects in the Hwange area work for the con­struc­tion of a car­bon steel plant which starts next year. Things are mov­ing. From there, His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited ZZCC. ZZCC have a coke bat­tery where they are pro­duc­ing 120 000 tonnes of coke. What has hap­pened is that ZZCC have been awarded a coal con­ces­sion on which they will open a new mine and, sec­ondly, con­struct a 180 000-tonne coke bat­tery. There­after His Ex­cel­lency went to Zam­bezi Gas. They are ex­pand­ing pro­duc­tion but they have also been granted a li­cence to con­struct a 750MW power sta­tion. The plant will be com­plete by 2025, but the ini­tial 150MW will be ready by 2023. From there, His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited Makomo, a key sup­plier of industrial cok­ing coal to var­i­ous mar­kets. Makomo have been awarded a sig­nif­i­cant con­tract by ZESA to sup­ply coal to (Hwange) num­ber 7 and 8, and they have come up with a huge investment to in­crease out­put. The last visit was at ZZEE. The coal con­ces­sion, which has been granted to ZZEE, will sup­ply here (at ZZEE) where a 450MW power sta­tion is be­ing con­structed. The cok­ing coal will feed into the 120 000tonne coke bat­tery at ZZCC and to an­other coke bat­tery which will be con­structed. Fun­da­men­tally, I must high­light that the coal and hy­dro­car­bon sec­tor had been tasked to achieve US$1 bil­lion in terms of the 2023 US$12 bil­lion mile­stone. In­di­ca­tions are that it will be the first sec­tor not only to achieve but to ex­ceed the US$1 bil­lion; it is a very good suc­cess story. The sec­ond is­sue which I would like to em­pha­sise is that this visit by His Ex­cel­lency has now clearly demon­strated that Zim­babwe is well on course to move from be­ing an im­porter of power, but a net ex­porter of power. The projects which His Ex­cel­lency vis­ited will even­tu­ally pro­duce in ex­cess of 3 000MW of power.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20191124,"Dis­ci­pline, loy­alty: The glue that keeps Zanu-PF in­tact","THE need for po­lit­i­cal par­ties to build them­selves into for­mi­da­ble units where one­ness, loy­alty, dis­ci­pline and an un­am­bigu­ous uni­di­rec­tional course is fol­lowed has re­mained a huge pie in the sky with a lot of de­fec­tions, be­tray­als, fac­tion­al­ism and over-am­bi­tion over­tak­ing the unity of pur­pose. In Zim­babwe the spec­trum stretches far be­yond in­de­pen­dence with history of de­fec­tions, be­trayal and plot­ting against each other lit­ter­ing the way and defin­ing the pol­i­tics of that time. It did not end there but it dragged it­self into the post-in­de­pen­dence era where al­most all po­lit­i­cal par­ties big and small have faced such de­vel­op­ments. Some have even swal­lowed them­selves and be­come ex­tinct. The few that have man­aged to stand the test of time have done so at the back of a strong ide­ol­ogy of unity of pur­pose, loy­alty and dis­ci­pline. Those that have not been able to con­tain the urge of di­vi­sive pol­i­tics have con­tin­ued to form them­selves into mul­ti­ple small units that could hardly be called po­lit­i­cal par­ties than a stake of tim­ber be called a ship. They have formed them­selves into a hotch­potch of frag­mented po­lit­i­cal par­ties char­ac­terised by a home­boy syn­drome or at most a tribal iden­tity not even ca­pa­ble of de­feat­ing a harem of old maids in any se­ri­ous po­lit­i­cal con­test. This is be­cause the val­ues of loy­alty, dis­ci­pline, service to the peo­ple and hav­ing a clearly de­fined set of re­spon­si­bil­i­ties will not have been in­stilled in the party mem­ber­ship. As a re­sult, there is al­ways the dan­ger of con­fus­ing democ­racy with moboc­racy. The sit­u­a­tion is al­most dystopian. Not least, the rul­ing Zanu-PF has been af­fected by these dy­nam­ics, with fears that the vi­cious cy­cle will con­tinue and that the rul­ing party may not en­joy sta­bil­ity. This, how­ever, led to the es­tab­lish­ment of the Chitepo School of Ide­ol­ogy where ide­ol­ogy and ex­pec­ta­tion is taught and is al­most in line with China’s high dis­ci­pline com­mu­nist ideals. A blue­print can be found in China where Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has set high ex­pec­ta­tions of party sec­re­taries in the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC). He em­pha­sises dis­ci­pline say­ing party sec­re­taries at all lev­els should work hard to serve the party and the peo­ple with a sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity and loy­alty. “. . . they face a heavy work­load to pro­mote re­form, de­vel­op­ment and sta­bil­ity, the test of en­sur­ing peo­ple’s well-be­ing and im­prov­ing their lives, the test of re­sist­ing all kinds of de­fec­tive think­ing and the temp­ta­tion of power, money and sex, the test of re­ject­ing base and un­healthy prac­tices known as the clan­des­tine rules, to name a few,” said Pres­i­dent Xi in Chi­nese Gov­er­nance com­pen­dium Vol­ume 2. Pres­i­dent Xi has called on his sec­re­taries not to look at them­selves urg­ing them to al­ways fol­low the cor­rect po­lit­i­cal di­rec­tion. “Al­ways re­mem­ber you are part of the or­gan­i­sa­tion, al­ways think of your­self as some­one who be­longs to the party and never for­get your obli­ga­tions and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to­wards the party. You must trust the party or­gan­i­sa­tion, rely on it, fol­low its or­ders, and con­sci­en­tiously safe­guard its unity and sol­i­dar­ity,” he says. He be­lieves it is not pos­si­ble for some­one with wa­ver­ing con­vic­tions to be loyal to the party. The CPC’s ide­ol­ogy dove­tails with Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s be­lief and calls in ser­vant lead­er­ship in Zanu-PF where party rep­re­sen­ta­tives have al­ways been en­cour­aged to care for the peo­ple. “You must not seek per­sonal gain, and you should self­lessly act in pub­lic in­ter­est, you should take lightly such things as rep­u­ta­tion, po­si­tion and in­ter­ests and never be cal­cu­lat­ing in pur­suit of these,” urged Pres­i­dent Xi. Analo­gies can be drawn from the CPC’s be­liefs and that of Zanu-PF as both Pres­i­dents have been call­ing for party of­fi­cials to de­sist from all forms of cor­rup­tion and other covert deals as it has a dan­ger of tar­nish­ing the party’s im­age and rep­u­ta­tion. Although the calls have not of­ten been re­cip­ro­cated by ac­tion on the ground, it is clear that the two Pres­i­dents share a com­mon vi­sion and in­ter­est of serv­ing peo­ple with dis­tinc­tion. Poverty al­le­vi­a­tion is a key task for the two par­ties and party of­fi­cials in im­pov­er­ished ar­eas have been called upon to be fully com­mit­ted to the task and to lead the peo­ple to shake off poverty through hard work. “If an of­fi­cial does not act on peo­ple’s be­half, he would be bet­ter go­ing back home and sell­ing sweet pota­toes. You must be ded­i­cated to your work in a down to earth, re­al­is­tic and prag­matic man­ner, and make solid and tan­gi­ble ef­forts. You should work in the peo­ple’s in­ter­ests and never in­dulge in waste­ful show­case projects to prop up your own im­age,” added Pres­i­dent Xi. He is a man who ab­hors lazi­ness and Zanu-PF of­fi­cials should pluck a leaf from his ideas. “You can not only think of seek­ing of­fice while avoid­ing any ac­tual work, only of wield­ing power while avoid­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity, and only of mak­ing a show while avoid­ing any real ef­fort. There must be change for the bet­ter in your area dur­ing your ten­ure of of­fice and stag­na­tion must not hap­pen,” he told his party sec­re­taries. The idea of unity in the party has also been mak­ing head­lines in Zanu-PF with Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa mak­ing clar­ion calls at ev­ery fora for unity to be ob­served in the party and at na­tional level. The CPC also stresses unity with Pres­i­dent Xi say­ing unity does not mean keep­ing on good terms with ev­ery­body and har­mony does not mean pa­per­ing over cracks. “You should ex­tend your ed­u­ca­tion to your fam­ily and im­me­di­ate staff, and res­train their con­duct, en­sur­ing that they re­spect the re­quire­ments of moral­ity, dis­ci­pline and the law,” he said. In Zanu-PF, the party lead­er­ship has been on record call­ing for dis­ci­pline to be ob­served at all lev­els of the party struc­tures. Like any other party de­fec­tions, dis­loy­alty, in­dis­ci­pline and fac­tion­al­ism have char­ac­terised the party but that it has re­mained stand­ing tall and strong speaks vol­umes of its history and its ide­ol­ogy whose anal­ogy can be found in the val­ues of the Com­mu­nist Party of China. Zanu-PF Com­mis­sar Cde Vic­tor Matemadanda called for ob­ser­va­tion of dis­ci­pline at all lev­els of the party struc­tures say­ing there should be unity of pur­pose and em­pha­sised that party pro­grammes must have a na­tional out­look. He also spoke against abuse of party re­sources. The party, he said, would not tol­er­ate any acts of in­dis­ci­pline. Cde Matemadanda re­cently made a thinly veiled at­tack at party senior of­fi­cials who try to de­fend in­dis­ci­pline say­ing such peo­ple would be sow­ing seeds of di­vi­sion. “There are those who think that in­dis­ci­pline will make them fear­some or vis­i­ble. Dis­ci­pline is very im­por­tant and if you en­gage in any acts of in­dis­ci­pline and think that a senior mem­ber will come to your res­cue, you will be putting that senior of­fi­cial in trou­ble. “If you see some­thing that you are not happy with, speak out pro­ce­du­rally. If you just speak reck­lessly while pow­ered by cheers from MDC, we will kick you out,” said Cde Matemadanda. “We don’t want lead­ers who say they own peo­ple, all peo­ple be­long to Zanu-PF. No one be­longs to Matemadanda or any other in­di­vid­ual. We will not tol­er­ate seeds of fac­tion­al­ism. “If we see that you are not fol­low­ing the line we will kick you out. We want to give our party time to push for de­vel­op­ment, not fac­tion­al­ism,” he said. His sen­ti­ments were echoed by the Prin­ci­pal of the Chitepo School of Ide­ol­ogy, Cde Mun­yaradzi Machacha, who warned mem­bers against abus­ing their prox­im­ity to the First Fam­ily to vi­o­late party pro­ce­dures.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160210,Ques­tion­ing the re-marginal­i­sa­tion of Africa,"IN JAN­UARY 2011, even be­fore the “Africa ris­ing” nar­ra­tive cap­tured the pop­u­lar imag­i­na­tion, the In­sti­tute for Se­cu­rity Stud­ies wrote ex­ten­sively about the con­ti­nent’s growth prospects in a mono­graph ti­tled, “African Fu­tures 2050”. It pointed to im­prove­ments in the qual­ity of macro-eco­nomic gov­er­nance, im­proved agri­cul­tural out­put and rel­a­tively sta­ble political frame­works, as well as in­creased aid and debt re­lief, ris­ing re­mit­tances and the im­pact of global growth — par­tic­u­larly that of China. Com­modi­ties, we ar­gued, were im­por­tant — but only re­spon­si­ble for a third to half of the surge in growth rates from the pre­vi­ous two decades. Africa’s prospects had un­der­gone a struc­tural shift for the bet­ter. Sub­se­quent work pointed to the diver­gent na­ture of the African growth story, where a dozen or so coun­tries seemed trapped in a cy­cle of chronic fragility, while many oth­ers were mak­ing ster­ling progress. We noted that even at an av­er­age an­nual growth rate fore­cast of 6 per­cent for Africa’s 54 coun­tries to 2035, the con­ti­nent was un­likely to see the elim­i­na­tion of ex­treme poverty by 2030 — the first of the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. For the ma­jor­ity of Africans, things are get­ting bet­ter; al­though not rapidly enough if com­pared, for ex­am­ple, with the speed at which China was able to trans­form it­self. To un­der­stand Africa’s chang­ing power ca­pa­bil­i­ties and its abil­ity to in­flu­ence global dy­nam­ics, we ex­am­ined the po­ten­tial of Africa’s “big five”: Nige­ria, South Africa, Al­ge­ria, Egypt and Ethiopia. We con­cluded that only Nige­ria had true po­ten­tial to be­come a glob­ally sig­nif­i­cant player, pro­vided it could over­come its nu­mer­ous gov­er­nance and se­cu­rity chal­lenges. In gen­eral, Africa’s in­flu­ence is set to ex­pand, but given a lack of deep con­ti­nen­tal in­te­gra­tion on both the political and eco­nomic front, the con­ti­nent will re­main rel­a­tively marginal in global affairs. The fu­ture is a world where three eco­nomic heavy weights — the United States of Amer­ica (USA), China and even­tu­ally In­dia, will have sig­nif­i­cantly more rel­a­tive ma­te­rial and diplo­matic power than oth­ers. Only a com­pletely in­te­grated Euro­pean Union could join th­ese three coun­tries at the top ta­ble of global in­flu­ence; and the gap be­tween th­ese global pow­ers and the rest is set to re­main large. Against this back­ground, it is now ap­pro­pri­ate to of­fer a word of cau­tion. Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, in par­tic­u­lar, may be over­looked on the global agenda and suf­fer a pe­riod of re­lapse into un­sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Far from a con­tin­ued scram­ble for Africa, as some an­a­lysts ex­alted only a few years ago, we’re far more likely to see a po­ten­tial re-marginal­i­sa­tion of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa in the years ahead. Three fac­tors un­der­pin this. The first is changes in China — to­day Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner, but a coun­try whose own eco­nomic re­bal­anc­ing has re­duced its thirst for com­modi­ties. This is, of course, tem­po­rary. Even­tu­ally In­dia’s eco­nomic awak­en­ing should drive the next com­modi­ties su­per-cy­cle and Africa should re­gain some of its lost mo­men­tum. But that is still some years hence. In the mean­time, global growth else­where re­mains anaemic and in­suf­fi­cient to re­place China’s pre­vi­ous de­mand for Africa’s nat­u­ral re­sources. In ad­di­tion, Saudi Ara­bia’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to pro­tect its global share of the oil mar­ket, re­sult­ing in an oil price per bar­rel hov­er­ing below $30, has hit Africa’s oil pro­duc­ers very hard. Large oil pro­duc­ers such as Nige­ria and An­gola have seen their main source of rev­enue slashed and oth­ers, in­clud­ing as­pi­rant and marginal pro­duc­ers — such as Ghana — face strong head­winds. Coun­tries such as Tan­za­nia and Mozam­bique, who were count­ing on the po­ten­tial of huge oil and gas in­comes, have dis­cov­ered that in­ter­est in ex­ploit­ing their nat­u­ral bounty has waned. To­gether with the im­pact of the shale rev­o­lu­tion in the US, Africa’s oil is not in cur­rent de­mand and this has trans­lated into eco­nomic pain and strate­gic marginal­i­sa­tion, par­tic­u­larly for West Africa. In its place is a quite nar­row se­cu­rity fo­cus, which is linked to the threat that al-Qaeda and the Is­lamic State pose to the West. The se­cond rea­son re­lates to ter­ror­ism and refugees; the two scourges that are fo­cus­ing all at­ten­tion on the Middle East and, to a lesser ex­tent, North Africa. De­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance aimed at pro­mot­ing in­clu­sive growth, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment and good gov­er­nance (tra­di­tion­ally from the West) is be­ing dec­i­mated as Europe scram­bles to re­spond to crises in Syria and else­where. This is, of course, not nec­es­sar­ily a bad thing. Re­mit­tance flows to Africa have al­ready sur­passed de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance in size, and it is only by lev­er­ing taxes from their own cit­i­zens in­stead of re­ly­ing on the largesse of tax­pay­ers in other coun­tries that Africa will de­velop. Ac­count­abil­ity re­quires tax-pay­ing cit­i­zens who have a prac­ti­cal in­cen­tive to hold their gov­ern­ments to ac­count, and ris­ing cor­po­rate and in­di­vid­ual tax rates in Africa is a pos­i­tive, if un­der­re­ported, good news story. On the other hand, mil­lions of poor Africans stand the risk of los­ing the sus­te­nance pro­vided by hu­man­i­tar­ian and de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance at a time when their own gov­ern­ments do not pro­vide. A new paradigm has emerged that looks to the pri­vate sec­tor and its role in de­vel­op­ment and hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance. Busi­ness and the pri­vate sec­tor, we are told, have to step up and as­sume their right­ful place as the driv­ers of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance and em­ploy­ment cre­ation. There is much truth here. Even­tu­ally only the pri­vate sec­tor can ex­pand em­ploy­ment and cre­ate wealth. But cur­rent lev­els of de­vel­op­ment mean that in much of Africa, only govern­ment can fight in­equal­ity and ex­ploita­tion, en­sure sta­bil­ity and man­age de­vel­op­ment pro­cesses that are in­her­ently dis­rup­tive. Rich coun­tries can do with less govern­ment since they have a thick web of norms and in­sti­tu­tions, but poor coun­tries can­not. By de­fault, the pri­vate sec­tor is in­ter­ested in profit. With­out ap­pro­pri­ate regulation and over­sight, its role ex­ac­er­bates divi­sions rather than pro­mot­ing in­clu­sive growth. Much of our pre­vi­ous work has there­fore un­der­lined the im­por­tance of gov­er­nance for Africa. In fact, we have been ar­gu­ing that as much as North Africa and the Middle East suf­fer from a se­vere deficit in lev­els of in­clu­sion in gov- er­nance, sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa faces large con­straints on the ca­pac­ity of gov­ern­ments to de­liver on de­vel­op­ment. The third fac­tor re­lates to a change in global pat­terns of political vi­o­lence. Af­ter the tur­bu­lence, war and in­sta­bil­ity that ac­com­pa­nied the end of the Cold War, Africa ex­pe­ri­enced a steady peace div­i­dend that lasted un­til about 2010 or mid2011. There­after, vi­o­lence and in­sta­bil­ity in Africa (and in­deed else­where) in­creased, al­though it seems to have lev­elled off in 2015. It is still too soon to tell whether that was a pause or a sign of a pos­i­tive re­ver­sal in trends. Like oth­ers, we be­lieve that the lo­cus of global in­sta­bil­ity will move to the Middle East in the years ahead. The dis­as­trous US-led in­va­sion of Iraq rekin­dled Is­lamist ter­ror­ism in the Middle East, and it is likely to in­ten­sify in­sta­bil­ity for a decade or longer. Whereas the USA pre­vi­ously served as peace guar­an­tor, it is un­able to con­tinue in that role. Hope­fully, the 2015 lev­el­ling off in con­flict will con­tinue in 2016 and be­come a down­ward trend. In the mean­time, great power games have shifted to the Middle East. The Sunni/Shia di­vide now pits Saudi Ara­bia against Iran in an ever-widen­ing se­ries of proxy wars, in a re­gion that is geo-strate­gi­cally im­por­tant, heav­ily armed, po­lit­i­cally un­sta­ble and al­ready host to an im­por­tant num­ber of proxy wars.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161213,Glob­al­i­sa­tion and its dis­con­tents,"GLOB­AL­I­SA­TION is un­der at­tack. The elec­toral vic­tory of Don­ald Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of an ag­gres­sive na­tion­al­ism in main­land Europe and around the world are all part of a back­lash to glob­al­i­sa­tion. In each in­stance, cit­i­zens have up­set the po­lit­i­cal or­der by vot­ing to roll back eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural glob­al­i­sa­tion. Sup­port for Brexit came in large part from those wor­ried about their jobs and the en­try of im­mi­grants. Sim­i­larly, the Mid­west of the US - the in­dus­trial heart­land hurt by global com­pe­ti­tion - was the lynch­pin of Don­ald Trump’s vic­tory in last month’s US elec­tions. But what ex­actly are these glob­al­i­sa­tions and why the dis­con­tent? A deeper ex­am­i­na­tion of global in­te­gra­tion sheds some light on how we got here and where we should go next. The rise of the glob­al­iza­tion agenda The roots of to­day’s global eco­nomic or­der were es­tab­lished just as World War II was com­ing to end. In 1944 del­e­gates from the Al­lied coun­tries met in Bret­ton Woods, New Hamp­shire, to es­tab­lish a new sys­tem around open mar­kets and free trade. New in­sti­tu­tions such as the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, the World Bank and a pre­cur­sor to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion were es­tab­lished to tie na­tional economies into an in­ter­na­tional sys­tem. There was a be­lief that greater global in­te­gra­tion was more con­ducive to peace and pros­per­ity than eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism. The foun­da­tions of global eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, such as the cre­ation of the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund in 1945, were laid af­ter World War II as an al­ter­na­tive to eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism and as a means to pro­mote peace and pros­per­ity. Ini­tially, it was more a prom­ise than re­al­ity. Com­mu­nism still con­trolled large swathes of ter­ri­tory. And there were fis­cal ten­sions as the new trade sys­tem re­lied on fixed ex­change rates, with cur­ren­cies pegged to the US dol­lar, which was tied to gold at the time. It was only with the col­lapse of fixed ex­change rates and the un­moor­ing of the dol­lar from the gold stan­dard in the late 1960s that cap­i­tal could be moved eas­ily around the world. And it worked: Dol­lars gen­er­ated in Europe by US multi­na­tion­als could be in­vested through Lon­don in sub­ur­ban hous­ing projects in Asia, mines in Aus­tralia and fac­to­ries in the Philip­pines. With China’s en­try onto the world trad­ing sys­tem in 1978 and the col­lapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the world of global cap­i­tal mo­bil­ity widened fur­ther. Global trans­fer of wealth While cap­i­tal could now sur­vey the world to en­sure the best re­turns, labour was fixed in place. This meant there was a pro­found change in the rel­a­tive bar­gain­ing power be­tween the two - away from or­gan­ised labour and to­wards a foot­loose cap­i­tal. When a com­pany such as Gen­eral Mo­tors moved a fac­tory from Michi­gan to Mex­ico or China, it made eco­nomic sense for the cor­po­ra­tion and its share­hold­ers, but it did not help work­ers in the US. Free­ing up trade re­stric­tions also led to a global shift in man­u­fac­tur­ing. The in­dus­trial base shifted from the high-wage ar­eas of North Amer­ica and Western Europe to the cheaper-wage ar­eas of East Asia: first Ja­pan, then South Korea, and more re­cently China and Viet­nam. The US and Western Europe saw a rapid dein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion as China and other coun­tries ramped up man­u­fac­tur­ing, of­fer­ing lower pro­duc­tion and labour costs to multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions. As a re­sult, there was a global re­dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth. In the West as fac­to­ries shut­tered, mechanised or moved over­seas, the liv­ing stan­dards of the work­ing class de­clined. Mean­while, in China pros­per­ity grew, with the poverty rate fall­ing from 84 per­cent in 1981 to only 12 per­cent by 2010. - Con­ver­sa­tion Africa.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151205,China not out to rob us: Pres­i­dent,"PRES­I­DENT Mu­gabe yes­ter­day blasted as dis­torted, claims by Africa’s de­trac­tors that the con­ti­nent’s re­la­tions with China were based on the Asian coun­try’s ap­petite for raw min­er­als. Speak­ing at the sum­mit for the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) here, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said Africa’s ties with China go deeper than that and the Asian coun­try was do­ing more for the con­ti­nent than its for­mer colonis­ers. “Once again, our de­trac­tors have sought to por­tray and re­duce re­la­tions to purely com­mer­cial ties driven, in their view, by China’s ap­petite for raw ma­te­ri­als from our con­ti­nent. That is what they say. On the con­trary, re­al­ity, for­tu­nately, does not con­form to such dis­torted imag­i­na­tive creations,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “Our re­la­tions go much deeper than the ex­trac­tion of re­sources. We’re com­mit­ted to strength­en­ing the cur­rent multi-faceted and multi-di­men­sional re­la­tions be­tween African coun­tries and China.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe was speak­ing af­ter Chi­nese Pres­i­dent and FOCAC ◆ ◆ co-chair­per­son Xi Jin­ping, had said in ad­dress that his coun­try was offering $60 bil­lion in loans and grants to Africa over the next three years. South African Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma is the co-chair­per­son of the sum­mit be­ing held un­der the theme, “China-Africa Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment.” Pres­i­dent Xi said his coun­try would roll out 10 ma­jor pro­grammes to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in the com­ing three years in the ar­eas of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion and pub­lic wel­fare, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and peace and se­cu­rity Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe, who is also the African Union chair­per­son, be­fore his speech de­scribed Pres­i­dent Xi’s state­ment as rich in terms of cov­er­ing as­sis­tance across all sec­tors of the con­ti­nent’s econ­omy. “Here’s a man rep­re­sent­ing a coun­try once called poor, a coun­try which never was our colonis­ers, but there you are, he’s do­ing to us what we ex­pected those who colonised us yes­ter­day to do. If they have ears to hear, let them hear. We say, may God bless China and its peo­ple,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said the sum­mit cel­e­brates a mile­stone in the evo­lu­tion of FOCAC in the 15 years of its in­cep­tion. “We there­fore reded­i­cate our­selves to the prin­ci­pal guide­lines of our re­la­tions and to the mu­tu­al­ity of the out­comes we seek in our co­op­er­a­tion in the po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, cul­tural and se­cu­rity spheres. Since the in­cep­tion of FOCAC, we have wit­nessed tremen­dous growth in re­la­tions be­tween Africa and China.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said China has be­come Africa’s premier in­vest­ment and trad­ing part­ner, a trend which will scale up Africa-China trade vol­umes to $400 bil­lion by 2020 from $220 bil­lion in 2014. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe com­mended ef­forts by FOCAC to deepen in­sti­tu­tional ties with re­gional bod­ies such as the AU and its struc­tures as well as the African De­vel­op­ment Bank. “We wel­come China’s sup­port for our de­ter­mi­na­tion to trans­form our coun­tries’ economies, through an in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion strat­egy which is driven by ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and value ad­di­tion of our nat­u­ral re­sources and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “We also deeply ap­pre­ci­ate China’s will­ing­ness and readi­ness to con­tinue to be a key part­ner in the de­vel­op­ment of our in­fra­struc­ture at the na­tional, re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal level.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said sev­eral group­ings of African coun­tries took some ma­jor de­ci­sions that, when im­ple­mented, will give strong im­pe­tus to im­prov­ing in­tra-African trade, and in offering ex­ter­nal part­ners such as China, a much larger source and trade mar­ket. He said the Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (CFTA) and COMESA — EAC — SADC Tri­par­tite Free Trade Area should con­trib­ute to in­te­grat­ing Africa’s mar­kets in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the free move­ment of goods. “There is no doubt that the rise of China and Africa, as two sig­nif­i­cant play­ers, will have a pos­i­tive and far reach­ing im­pact in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions that en­sure the democrati­sa­tion of the in­ter­nal sys­tem of gov­er­nance,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “The per­pet­u­a­tion of the his­toric in­jus­tice of the cur­rent sys­tem, be it in the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil or the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions, is un­healthy and un­de­sir­able. “Now to­gether with China we should push for real democ­racy at the United Na­tions. We con­tinue to count on China’s sup­port and sol­i­dar­ity in re­dress­ing this sit­u­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said in pur­suit of im­ple­ment­ing the global de­vel­op­ment agenda adopted at the United Na­tions in New York last Septem­ber, it was im­por­tant to as­sess the ef­fi­ciency of FOCAC in the new de­vel­op­ment con­text. In his ad­dress, Pres­i­dent Xi called for the up­grad­ing of China-Africa strate­gic part­ner­ship to a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship as­sur­ing the con­ti­nent that his coun­try will ad­here to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, real re­sults, affin­ity and good faith and strike a right bal­ance be­tween up­hold­ing prin­ci­ples and pur­su­ing ben­e­fits in its Africa pol­icy. Pres­i­dent Xi said the co­op­er­a­tion will be based on equal­ity and mu­tual trust and that his coun­try’s stance that Africa should man­age its own af­fairs and that China was ready to as­sist the con­ti­nent in safe­guard­ing peace and se­cu­rity. Pres­i­dent Zuma paid trib­ute to Pres­i­dent Xi for the new mea­sures and also ac­knowl­edged, “the tan­gi­ble con­tri­bu­tion of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China’s with re­gard to peace­keep­ing in Africa. In ad­di­tion to par­tic­i­pat­ing in up to 16 United Na­tions Peace­keep­ing Mis­sions in Africa, China cur­rently has ap­prox­i­mately 2 000 peace­keep­ing per­son­nel on the ground. “We ap­pre­ci­ate this com­mit­ment to peace, de­vel­op­ment and progress,” said Pres­i­dent Zuma. “It gives prac­ti­cal mean­ing to the be­lief of Pres­i­dent Xi that China’s mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity must be utilised to achieve peace.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Manica Post,20190215,Prof Pfukwa head-to-head with MM on Ra­dio,"PRO­FES­SOR Charles Pfukwa (CP), also ed­i­tor of The Pa­triot, is the ex­ec­u­tive dean-So­cial Sci­ences and Hu­man­i­ties (So­cial work, Peace and Gov­er­nance, Lan­guages and Com­mu­ni­ca­tion Skills, Cul­ture and Her­itage Stud­ies) at Bin­dura Univer­sity of Sci­ence Ed­u­ca­tion. Re­cently he was in Mutare and was kind enough to give MM an in­ter­view on his ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme-Head-To-Head. MM: Pro­fes­sor Pfukwa, you hold a colos­sal po­si­tion of re­spon­si­bil­ity at Bin­dura Univer­sity . . . Ex­ec­u­tive Dean. Do you want to de­scribe your func­tion at an in­sti­tu­tion like this? CP: The func­tion of an ex­ec­u­tive dean is to su­per­in­tend over a num­ber of de­part­ments in a fac­ulty . . . in a group of learn­ing dis­ci­plines. MM: Clear Prof . . . very clear in­deed! Tell us, what is a good univer­sity? What is the pur­pose of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion? I have a strong sus­pi­cion, Prof, that a lot of par­ents, young women and men think it is best to have a univer­sity de­gree be­cause it is a sym­bol of eman­ci­pa­tion . . . a sym­bol of per­sonal glory. It is all about per­sonal glory . . . noth­ing more. Prof, what is the best per­cep­tion of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion? CP: That’s a very dif­fi­cult ques­tion . . . MM: I know . . . need I apol­o­gise? CP: No, no, no . . .You don’t need to apol­o­gise for ask­ing a dif­fi­cult ques­tion. MM: Thank you Prof. CP: Your dif­fi­cult ques­tions set us think­ing. They let us take a hard look at our­selves . . . let us think where are com­ing from and where are we go­ing. First of all it is im­por­tant for us to look at this from a back­drop of a colo­nial ed­u­ca­tion. That is very im­por­tant to bear in mind. Look­ing at the aca­demic cul­tures that we set up in these uni­ver­si­ties! We must bear in mind that these in­tel­lec­tual cul­tures and tra­di­tions we set up are deeply steeped in West­ern tra­di­tions. Our yard­sticks are Cam­bridge, Mas­sachusetts Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy, Har­vard, Yale, Berkely. But is it the proper yard­stick? What­ever we do in our own uni­ver­si­ties, do we need to mea­sure our­selves against those for­eign or in­ter­na­tional stan­dards? MM: Search me Prof. Is that a po­lite way of say­ing we are copy-cat­ing for­eign sys­tems of ed­u­ca­tion? A po­lite ad­mis­sion of guilt! CP: The very fact that we are con­duct­ing this dis­cus­sion in English is a prob­lem on its own. This has been ar­gued ex­ten­sively by Ngugi waThiongo and other schol­ars. If we were in Ja­pan we would be con­duct­ing this de­bate in Ja­pa­nese. If we were in China, in Chi­nese . . . and so forth and so on! That is a big state­ment about how we are still liv­ing in a tra­di­tion where we do not own our sys­tems of knowl­edge . . . the way we pack­age . . . we con­cep­tu­alise our knowl­edges . . . the way we de­ploy this knowl­edge in so­ci­ety. MM: There is noth­ing home grown about it . . . you think? CP: Not at all! That’s one of the great­est dif­fi­cul­ties . . . be­cause this knowl­edge we are pack­ag­ing . . . we are man­u­fac­tur­ing . . . is de­signed by a cul­ture and tra­di­tion that has noth­ing to do with the Zim­bab­wean man or woman in the street, or in the ru­ral com­mu­nity strug­gling with his field where he or she is grow­ing, may be ‘‘mut­sine’’ or some lit­tle crop. It’s ir­rel­e­vant be­cause it has never been of value to the west­ern world. But you and I know that ‘‘mut­sine’’ or ‘‘nyevhe’’ must end up in the lab­o­ra­tory . . . MM: . . . be­cause these are veg­eta­bles with very high med­i­cal and nu­tri­tional value! CP: Ex­actly! And this is where we must be­gin our schol­ar­ship . . . this is where we must be­gin to shape our pro­cesses of learn­ing and take them as far as Univer­sity. Be­cause these an­swer our own is­sues . . . our own prob­lems. This il­lus­trates our needs. MM: And some may not even know ‘‘mut­sine’’ is black jack. CP: Ex­actly why I keep in­sist­ing on ‘‘mut­sine’’ be­cause ‘‘black jack’’ is a mis­nomer that was brought by peo­ple with a deroga­tory lan­guage that adul­ter­ated our cul­tural val­ues and dig­nity. We con­ceive . . . ar­tic­u­late, ex­press our­selves . . . our to­tal con­cep­tual frame in a lan­guage that den­i­grates us. MM: Are uni­ver­si­ties se­ri­ously cog­nisant of what you are say­ing Prof or they are only too happy to run along with a colo­nial . . . im­pe­ri­al­ist sys­tem of ed­u­ca­tion? CP: I am not alone in this prob­lem . . . I am sure. The so­lu­tions may still be far, but the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem is slowly shift­ing to­wards the right di­rec­tion. The set­ting up of in­sti­tu­tions that are Sci­ence-based, Agri­cul­tural based, Tech­no­log­i­cal based, in­stead of churn­ing out thou­sands of a hu­man­i­ties crop of per­son­nel . . . teach­ers, nurses ver­sus very few doc­tors and engi­neers and ge­ol­o­gists, is a step to­wards the so­lu­tion of those prob­lems we in­her­ited from a colo­nial past. MM: In short and in sim­ple lan­guage Prof, what is the role of a univer­sity in na­tional de­vel­op­ment and is that what you do, namely as­sist in na­tional de­vel­op­ment . . . in na­tional build­ing? Or what you are good at is dec­o­rat­ing grad­u­ates with colour­ful de­grees that nei­ther im­prove the holder nor bet­ter the na­tion! CP: What is the role of univer­sity, first? Univer­sity is the high­est stage of in­tel­lec­tual en­quiry . . . and a good in­sti­tu­tion should solve the prob­lems of so­ci­ety. An ideal univer­sity must pro­duce hu­man re­sources needed for the growth of the na­tion. And the an­swers must guide pol­icy mak­ers. Let me give an ex­am­ple of a strange dis­ease . . . maybe it is a plant virus that is at­tack­ing the baobab trees in and around Chipinge leav­ing it with a tree-lep­rosy kind of black spots. Is it a cli­mate prob­lem? What­ever it is, if the baobab tree be­comes ex­tinct, we have lost the fruits, the shade and the very en­vi­ron­ment. Yet we can­not take the prob­lem of a dy­ing baobab to the Univer­sity of Lon­don . . . Glas­gow or New York. They don’t know any­thing about the baobab. But what do we do? We still worry a lot and talk a lot about the pine tree, the cy­press . . . the gum and sycamore tree. MM: Pro­fes­sor, your def­i­ni­tion of a good univer­sity is palat­able to the ear . . . on this pro­gramme? But is that what is hap­pen­ing in the uni­ver­si­ties, in­clud­ing Bin­dura where you are ex­ec­u­tive dean? I am sure you can now guess why I in­vited you to this pro­gramme. Is what you are im­pres­sively ar­tic­u­lat­ing here what you are do­ing at Bin­dura? What prob­lems are you solv­ing? What prob­lems are other uni­ver­si­ties solv­ing be­ing cen­tres of the high­est in­tel­lec­tual en­quiry as you said? If you are solv­ing these prob­lems why do we still have so many prob­lems around us: un­em­ploy­ment rate of 80 per­cent plus, an al­most per­ma­nently stag­nant na­tional pass rate of be­tween 30 and 35 per­cent in schools? Clearly it is more ap­pro­pri­ate to talk about a fail­ure rate . . . not a pass rate in Zim­babwe be­cause year-in-year-out 65 to 70 per­cent of can­di­dates in schools fails ex­am­i­na­tions. That is a wor­ri­some phe­nom­e­non, is it not? We have a whole litany of prob­lems haunting Zim­bab­weans ev­ery day and ev­ery night. Where are the uni­ver­si­ties? Where is the ex­ec­u­tive dean? . . . Where are the ex­ec­u­tive deans of uni­ver­si­ties? Have they for­got­ten to su­per­in­tend over their aca­demic pro­grammes? CP: Al­low me to use the ex­am­ple of NGOs in Zim­babwe. They are here year-in-yearout. Most of them pur­port to be here to alle­vi­ate poverty? Why are we still with poverty around? MM: Very sim­ple pro­fes­sor! Most of these NGOs have dis­mally failed to en­gen­der eq­ui­table an­swers to the prob­lem of poverty. Hand-outs for ex­am­ple solve the prob­lem of poverty for to­day . . . prob­a­bly to­mor­row, but cer­tainly not a per­ma­nent an­swer to poverty. That is a re­lief mea­sure . . . not a per­ma­nent so­lu­tion to poverty. They per­pet­u­ate poverty de­lib­er­ately or by de­fault be­cause they thrive on the prob­lems of poor Africans. Of course not all of them . . . but most of them cre­ate prob­lems for Africans so that they con­tinue to be seen to be help­ing them. Mean­while en­rich­ing them­selves in the busi­ness of as­sist­ing poor Africans! It’s that sim­ple. CP: Back to the dy­ing baobab tree in the Sabi Valley. Big in­sti­tu­tions in New York . . . in Lon­don . . . in what­ever big city in the world will never fund a re­search pro­gramme to save the African baobab in the Sabi Valley. If they do, they will at­tach strings at­tached to the re­search pro­grammes: hu­man rights and po­lit­i­cal is­sues at­tached. Are they re­ally in­ter­ested in find­ing a so­lu­tion to the dy­ing baobab when they do that? Or they want to glo­rify them­selves or fur­ther­ing their own in­ter­ests . . . and mak­ing money. If a re­search of this na­ture is funded, it is con­ducted in those coun­tries and ends up ben­e­fit­ing them, not us. MM: Mean­while what are you busy do­ing in our uni­ver­si­ties Prof? CP: If you want to re­search on im­prov­ing soya-bean yields, you don’t get the fund­ing. Yet, soya-bean farm­ing on more than one hectare of land de­mands mech­a­ni­sa­tion! What with the costs in­volved? Can a poor peas­ant farmer af­ford the costs? Surely there is need for re­search on cheaper and bet­ter farm­ing meth­ods. The same with Gold min­ing! There are gold de­posits al­most ev­ery­where in Zim­babwe. How does the lo­cal player . . . the ko­rokoza be­come a gen­uine small scale miner le­gally and le­git­i­mately earn­ing a liv­ing for him or her­self? MM: My ques­tion still stands Prof. What are you do­ing in those uni­ver­si­ties . . . to make the lives of or­di­nary peo­ple bet­ter? You said Uniz are cen­tres of prob­lem solv­ing. What prob­lems are they solv­ing? If any­thing, iron­i­cally these are grad­u­ally be­com­ing cen­tres of all sorts of prob­lems . . . hubs of drug tak­ing and push­ing, havens of stu­dent pros­ti­tu­tion, HIV and AIDS con­duits . . . well, that is a topic of dis­cus­sion and de­bate for an­other day. CP: To­day we talk about Ed­u­ca­tion 5.0 This means go­ing be­yond the ba­sic re­search, teach­ing and com­mon ser­vice. This now talks about in­no­va­tion in ed­u­ca­tion . . . train­ing peo­ple to be prob­lem solv­ing. And be­yond in­no­va­tion . . . there is the need for cre­ation of our own wealth . . . to patent it and link it with en­trepreneur­ship . . . with in­dus­try . . . with fi­nanciers . . . put to­gether a pack­age . . . ma­chin­ery to work to­wards bet­ter, cheaper, ef­fec­tive ex­trac­tion of gold ver­sus the huge gold com­pa­nies. You want to lo­calise the ben­e­fits of the lo­cal player or peas­ant. (to be con­tin­ued.)",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20181116,Zim in good po­si­tion for Chi­nese in­vest­ment,"CHINA, the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy after the United States, says po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic changes that have hap­pened in Zim­babwe put the coun­try in good stead to ben­e­fit from fund­ing sup­port China has set aside un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive. The Asian tiger has ear­marked $120 bil­lion for co-op­er­a­tion with Africa un­der the ini­tia­tive. Zim­babwe saw long awaited change of power with the rise to power in Novem­ber last year of Pres­i­dent Mnangagwa and his sub­se­quent vic­tory in the July 30, 2018, har­monised elec­tion, fol­low­ing which the Pres­i­dent ap­pointed sev­eral new faces to his new lean Cab­i­net. But the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant has im­plored its now com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship ally to move with speed and draw up a list of bank­able and fea­si­ble projects that can be funded in terms of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, or else the re­sources that are avail­able will be ex­hausted by other African States that may move faster. Zim­babwe re­port­edly did not ben­e­fit as much as it should have from China un­der the pre­vi­ous lead­er­ship due to the for­mer ad­min­is­tra­tion’s poli­cies. Also, he said the pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion would not fol­low through on signed co-op­er­a­tion agree­ments. China’s act­ing am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Zhao Bao­gang was speak­ing at a work­shop or­gan­ised by the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe In­dus­tries (CZI) and fa­cil­i­tated by the UZ Grad­u­ate School of Man­age­ment on how Zim­babwe can un­lock Chi­nese fund­ing. The Chi­nese diplo­mat gave a lec­ture on how China turned around its econ­omy to grow at an av­er­age 9 per­cent per an­num over four decades. Am­bas­sador Bao­gang said China was acutely aware of the ur­gent need for de­vel­op­ment in Zim­babwe and was do­ing ev­ery­thing hu­manly pos­si­ble to en­cour­age Chi­nese in­vestors to come to in­vest in the coun­try. The top diplo­mat ex­pressed hope that ex­ploratory vis­its by Chi­nese in­vestors could lead to in­vest­ments. China ini­tially set aside $60 bil­lion un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, which its Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping ini­ti­ated in 2013 with the aim of build­ing a closer Africa-China com­mu­nity with a shared fu­ture, but dou­bled the fig­ure by adding a fur­ther $60 bil­lion pledge at Fo­rum for China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion in Bei­jing last Septem­ber. The fund­ing pledged at FO­CAC 2018 en­tails $15 bil­lion for grants, in­ter­est free loans, con­ces­sional loans, $30 bil­lion lines of credit and $10 bil­lion for in­vest­ment in African coun­tries, Am­bas­sador Bao­gang noted. Un­der the Belt and Road ini­tia­tive there are sev­eral cat­e­gories for pro­posed co-op­er­a­tion and fund­ing sup­port chiefly fund­ing sup­port to­wards pol­icy co-or­di­na­tion, trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion, con­nec­tiv­ity fa­cil­i­ta­tion, and also peo­ple to peo­ple ex­changes. “What is in­ter­est­ing is that Zim­babwe is also part of this (Belt and Road). This year Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnangagwa vis­ited China, we signed MoUs . . . I be­lieve that Zim­babwe will ben­e­fit greatly from the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive,” Am­bas­sador Bao­gang said. “We ex­pect that Zim­babwe could ben­e­fit from the con­ces­sional loans pro­vided by the Chi­nese govern­ment, by Chi­nese fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions un­der the frame­work of FO­CAC. The most im­por­tant thing is that the dif­fer­ent departments of the Govern­ment have to have more co­or­di­na­tion and come up with bank­able, fea­si­ble projects; give us a list of projects then we can have more con­sul­ta­tions on these and then in fu­ture we hope we can reach con­sen­sus on some of the projects.” The Chi­nese diplo­mat said to achieve suc­cess, China un­der­took de­lib­er­ate re­form mea­sures and im­ple­mented poli­cies, through its strong po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, which bore phe­nom­e­nal re­sults and placed the coun­try at the top of the global econ­omy and also gave it more po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence and that Zim­babwe needed to do the same. “I sug­gest some ex­perts should do some re­search on ex­pe­ri­ences in Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozam­bique or Zam­bia and cer­tainly, you also have your own ad­van­tages and you must try to see what you have done well and prob­lems you have and then you cor­rect or im­prove them, I be­lieve you can at­tract more Chi­nese in­vest­ment.” Through re­forms it has un­der­taken by at­tract­ing in­vest­ment in the last 40 years, Am­bas­sador Bao­gang said China has de­vel­oped fast, av­er­ag­ing a growth rate of 9 per­cent and this has en­abled the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try to lift out of poverty 740 mil­lion peo­ple, which he said is “great achieve­ment and we have 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple”. He said apart from ef­forts Bei­jing is mak­ing to pro­mote Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Zim­babwe, the Chi­nese in­vestors also nat­u­rally liked Zim­babwe due to the coun­try’s good cli­mate, skilled hu­man re­sources and the strong po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship. Am­bas­sador Bao­gang backed Zim­babwe to at­tract sig­nif­i­cant Chi­nese in­vest­ment as Govern­ment, un­der the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Mnangagwa, was “hard work­ing” to­gether with the cur­rent min­is­ters “so if we have good poli­cies those in­vestors will come.” “We ex­per­i­ment, we al­ways want to cross the river by feel­ing the stones, we have to touch the stone and then step on it, once we feel that we are safe, then we cross the river. In China when we make poli­cies we first seek the views of Govern­ment of­fi­cials, then ex­perts; then we im­ple­ment the poli­cies in small cities or lim­ited re­gions and when we see that they are suc­cess­ful, we put into wider prac­tice,” the am­bas­sador said. He said that China’s suc­cess was due to its hard work and “if we com­pare the per­for­mance be­tween the two sides we can see the dif­fer­ence”. Fur­ther, eco­nomic suc­cess was due to the fact that China em­braced the world and changed our men­tal­ity. “Later, we found out that we must em­brace the world, at­tract FDI. Be­cause now we have in­vest­ment, we have em­ploy­ment, we have salaries, we have tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and after sev­eral years we can repli­cate it, we can copy it. From the Zim­babwe per­spec­tive, we are happy to see that you have a new po­lit­i­cal dis­pen­sa­tion and new Govern­ment, new lead­ers, new eco­nomic needs, new poli­cies, amended the in­di­geni­sa­tion (and eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment) pol­icy; no lim­its for many sec­tors. This is greatly wel­come by the in­vestors.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151216,China-Africa co-op­er­a­tion scales new heights,"SINCE the for­ma­tion of the China Africa Fo­rum 15 years ago, re­la­tions be­tween the two sides have con­tin­ued to scale new heights in the ar­eas of eco­nomic, cul­tural, po­lit­i­cal and se­cu­rity spheres. The 2015 Johannesburg Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co-op­er­a­tion has taken fur­ther bold steps to ce­ment mu­tual ben­e­fit be­tween the two sides while tak­ing the ties to even higher lev­els, in­clud­ing a new US$60 bil­lion Chi­nese fund to sup­port de­vel­op­ment on the African con­ti­nent. Al­though re­la­tions be­tween China and Africa span sev­eral cen­turies - from the pre-colo­nial re­la­tions which were largely trade driven through colo­nial era re­la­tions when po­lit­i­cal and mil­i­tary co-op­er­a­tion blos­somed, to the post-colo­nial era when eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion has taken cen­tre-stage while po­lit­i­cal ties have re­mained im­por­tant - China has re­cently shown un­prece­dented in­ter­est in Africa more than any other part of the world. The Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) enun­ci­ated in 2000 has pro­vided a more struc­tured plat­form for deep­en­ing the ties be­tween the two sides in a broad spec­trum of fields from po­lit­i­cal to eco­nomic ar­eas. Lat­est fig­ures in­di­cate that trade be­tween the two sides reached US$220 bil­lion in 2014 while China’s direct in­vest­ment in Africa topped US$30 bil­lion in the same year. In an ad­dress to the open­ing cer­e­mony of the Johannesburg Sum­mit of Focac on De­cem­ber 4, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping an­nounced 10 China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion Projects which will be sup­ported by a US$60 bil­lion fund. The plan cov­ers de­vel­op­ment in a wide range of sec­tors of the African con­ti­nent, in­clud­ing im­prove­ment of the con­ti­nent’s in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, up­grad­ing ru­ral and ur­ban set­tle­ments, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion, health im­prove­ment, cul­ture and peo­ple to peo­ple ex­change, and peace and se­cu­rity co-op­er­a­tion. Out­lin­ing his coun­try’s vi­sion for Africa, Xi said the fund, which con­sists of grants, favourable con­ces­sion­ary loans and other in­vest­ment funds, will be chan­nelled into ar­eas se­lected by African coun­tries as op­posed to pri­or­i­ties im­posed by oth­ers. He said China’s for­eign pol­icy on Africa was guided by five prin­ci­ples that in­clude po­lit­i­cal equal­ity and mu­tual trust, win-win eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion, mu­tu­ally en­rich­ing cul­tural and peo­ple to peo­ple ex­changes, mu­tual as­sis­tance in peace and se­cu­rity, and sol­i­dar­ity and co­op­er­a­tion in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs. Zim­babwe Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe, who is the African Union chair, led African lead­ers in thank­ing the Chi­nese pres­i­dent for his gen­er­ous as­sis­tance to the con­ti­nent. “Here is a man rep­re­sent­ing a coun­try once called poor; a coun­try that never colonised us, do­ing what those who once colonised us ought to be do­ing,” he said, call­ing on the con­ti­nent’s erst­while colo­nial pow­ers to take no­tice. On his part, South African Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma, who by virtue of his coun­try host­ing the 2015 Focac Sum­mit, said China has been a “con­sis­tent friend of Africa”. He said the theme of the 2015 Sum­mit, that is, “Africa-China Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment”, dove­tails with Agenda 2063, the con­ti­nent’s long term vi­sion. Ev­ery­one from the United States of Amer­ica to Europe is seek­ing to do busi­ness with China, aim­ing for a share of the Asian gi­ant’s US$4.3 tril­lion re­serves. Africa is no ex­cep­tion. Much more im­por­tant, African lead­ers are seek­ing mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial co-op­er­a­tion with China. Both Mu­gabe and Zuma made this point quite clear. Mu­gabe spoke for the ma­jor­ity of Africans when he said the West has a dis­torted view of re­la­tions be­tween China and Africa. He said the west has “sought to por­tray and re­duce our re­la­tions to purely com­mer­cial eyes driven in their view, as they say, by China’s ap­petite for and de­sire to ex­tract raw ma­te­ri­als from our con­ti­nent . . . On the con­trary, re­al­ity, for­tu­nately, does not con­form to such dis­torted imag­i­na­tive creations”. He said the “re­la­tions go much deeper than the ex­trac­tion of re­sources”. The fact of China not mov­ing into Africa for the con­ti­nent’s re­sources has been al­layed by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties on many oc­ca­sions. Xi in par­tic­u­lar has con­sis­tently spo­ken of the “new nor­mal” where the world is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes. Part of that “new nor­mal” has no doubt man­i­fested it­self in the mat­u­ra­tion of the Chi­nese econ­omy, which is now seek­ing to shift from one that is re­source hun­gry to a new eco­nomic sys­tem that is con­sumer-driven with a strong mid­dle class. It is an econ­omy that is seek­ing to ex­port some of its labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries into Africa, for ex­am­ple build­ing in­dus­trial parks that will take ad­van­tage of the con­ti­nent’s de­mo­graphic div­i­dend. Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is AU Com­mis­sion chair­per­son, said Africa is set to ben­e­fit from in­vest­ment by Chi­nese en­ter­prises as the con­ti­nent “has a young pop­u­la­tion in an age­ing world”. She said the move was even more wel­come given the con­ti­nent’s quest to ben­e­fi­ci­ate and value-add in or­der to cre­ate jobs and hedge against the volatil­ity of the prices of its pri­mary com­modi­ties on the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket. The Johannesburg Sum­mit, run­ning from De­cem­ber 4-5, was pre­ceded by meet­ings of se­nior of­fi­cials and min­is­ters, as well as fora for the pri­vate sec­tor, academia and the me­dia, all of which set the mo­men­tum for the sum­mit. This is the 6th Focac at min­is­te­rial level since 2000 and only the sec­ond sum­mit. The first sum­mit was held in Beijing in 2006. The Johannesburg Sum­mit was at­tended by 50 African coun­tries, mostly at head of state level, as well as rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the African Union and its re­gional eco­nomic com­mu­ni­ties. - sardc.net/",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200604,Lock­down ed­u­ca­tion can­not wait but….,"AS part of the drive to trans­form our world, lead­ers came up with goal 4 of the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals to en­sure in­clu­sive eq­ui­table qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion and pro­mote life­long learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for all. This goal, com­ing on the heels of a widely shared ac­knowl­edge­ment that the MDGs were suc­cess­ful but in re­al­ity did not erad­i­cate in­equal­i­ties to me is very im­por­tant as it has im­pli­ca­tions for the suc­cess of es­pe­cially goal num­ber one on end­ing poverty. The goal on ed­u­ca­tion is so crit­i­cal that COVID-19 or COVID-19 ed­u­ca­tion just has to con­tinue. This would ex­plain why par­ents and pol­i­cy­mak­ers are wor­ried about the im­pact of the COVID-19-re­lated lock­down on learn­ers’ ed­u­ca­tion. For most fam­i­lies, ed­u­cat­ing chil­dren re­mains the ticket out of poverty, hunger and poor health. Ed­u­ca­tion, there­fore, has to con­tinue in one form or an­other. While the less-dis­ad­van­taged par­ents and care­givers are ar­rang­ing on­line learn­ing for their chil­dren, learn­ers who de­pend on gov­ern­ment-sub­sidised class­room-based ed­u­ca­tion wait at home and hope for a mir­a­cle. Gov­ern­ment has, there­fore, an­nounced a phased process of schools re-open­ing. At the mo­ment every­one is wor­ried, par­ents worry about de­layed learn­ing. Teach­ers must be wor­ried about how they are go­ing to rear­range their class­rooms to ac­com­mo­date preven­tion of COVID-19 in­fec­tion among learn­ers. Pol­i­cy­mak­ers on their part must be wor­ried about how the lock­down will im­pact on lean­ers ed­u­ca­tion and in the long run on Zim­babwe’s abil­ity to de­liver on sus­tain­able goal 4 to its chil­dren. Lean­ers are stressed and wor­ried about how school re-open­ing will look like. My seven-year-old daugh­ter the other day said to me “mama, I am afraid of go­ing back to school be­cause I heard that if you are touched by some­one who has corona you will be in­fected”. That is part of the worry at that level. This broke my heart and even as I tried to give her age ap­pro­pri­ate information and as­sure her that she will be safe, I re­alised that it’s go­ing to be a long road for all in­volved. I re­sented this virus for mak­ing our chil­dren carry such a huge psy­cho­log­i­cal bur­den. It hit me that I ac­tu­ally was not very sure of what mech­a­nisms for safety will be avail­able when/if schools open! Not­ing my worry, my hus­band sug­gested I write some­thing about the need to con­tinue ed­u­ca­tion within the war against COVID-19. So here we are. The bot­tom line is that at some point, schools will have to open. We, how­ever, have to plan for that even­tu­al­ity now. We should not wait for an an­nounce­ment that schools will open on a given date to start think­ing about what form that open­ing will take. COVID-19 ap­pears to be with us for a long time and with this re­al­ity in mind, we have to main­stream its preven­tion into the school sys­tem. The first thing is to iden­tify points of vul­ner­a­bil­ity, both phys­i­cal and psy­choso­cial and take mit­i­ga­tory mea­sures. Main­tain­ing the learn­ing spirit The first thing to do if it’s not al­ready hap­pen­ing is to strengthen the part­ner­ship be­tween teach­ers and par­ents in main­tain­ing the learn­ing spirit as we try to re­group and open our schools. In re­search­ing for this ar­ti­cle I came across a 2017 ar­ti­cle by Quinn and Po­likoff that said on av­er­age learn­ers’ achieve­ment scores de­clined over nor­mal school hol­i­days by one month’s worth of school learn­ing. The world over lock­downs have kept chil­dren away from school for far much longer than the nor­mal termly breaks and it would make sense to ex­trap­o­late that with­out any in­ter­ven­tion, the loss would be more. I would, there­fore, urge par­ents and care­givers to fa­cil­i­tate some kind of con­tin­ued learn­ing at home. For those who have tele­vi­sions and ac­cess to in­ter­net data, there are ba­sic lessons on tele­vi­sion. Par­ents can ar­range to sup­port the teach­ers with data to send learn­ing ex­er­cises over the phone. These ex­er­cises can then be marked by the par­ents with guid­ance from the teacher. Kraft and Monti-Nuss­baum in their ran­domised trial re­port ti­tled Can schools em­power par­ents to pre­vent sum­mer learn­ing loss? found that some­thing as simple as send­ing text mes­sages over school hol­i­days to par­ents of pri­mary school learn­ers at risk of hol­i­day loss was ef­fec­tive at im­prov­ing the read­ing scores of third and fourth grade learn­ers. The text mes­sages could in­clude sug­gested play ac­tiv­i­ties to do with the learn­ers that would help them re­mem­ber con­cepts and ac­tual read­ing and writ­ing ex­er­cises. Most of us have phones, let’s use them to keep learn­ing alive for our chil­dren. We also need to think of al­ter­na­tive in­terim mea­sures such as ra­dio lessons. Ra­dio lessons When I was in pri­mary school, ev­ery school had ra­dios that were used for lessons. I re­mem­ber we would sit around the ra­dio set with our teacher and lis­ten to the voice from the ra­dio and fol­low­ing in­struc­tions given by the ra­dio teacher we would write ex­er­cises that would be marked by the class teacher. Pol­i­cy­mak­ers and their NGO part­ners have to se­ri­ously think about re­viv­ing this con­cept in one form or an­other. I am aware some­thing sim­i­lar is al­ready hap­pen­ing on TV, but a ra­dio is more af­ford­able for both gov­ern­ment and par­ents. We could take ad­van­tage of the pro­vin­cial ra­dio sta­tions to en­sure learn­ing con­ti­nu­ity. This would, how­ever, not re­place class­room learn­ing and we would still have to plan for that. There are two ma­jor points of vul­ner­a­bil­ity for the learn­ers as dis­cussed be­low. Travel to and from school Most ur­ban learn­ers travel to school on public trans­port. Those in ru­ral ar­eas walk to school. With what is known so far about COVID-19, public trans­port would be a source of in­fec­tion par­tic­u­larly for young lean­ers as it is used by many com­muters. We can­not avoid this mode of travel for learn­ers. I would urge gov­ern­ment to ded­i­cate a given num­ber of school buses for chil­dren. These would have to be ster­ilised more than once in a day and should be used by learn­ers and their teach­ers only. I am aware learn­ers stay in di­verse lo­ca­tions, but still think it should be pos­si­ble to ar­range com­mon trans­port in col­lab­o­ra­tion with schools. Within the school There is a video of a post lock­down Chi­nese school cir­cu­lat­ing on social me­dia. The video shows a state of the art preven­tion equip­ment de­signed to check learn­ers and dis­in­fect them at many dif­fer­ent points within the school. It in­cludes dis­in­fec­tion of shoe soles, wash­ing of hands, per­sonal cu­bi­cles in class etc. As I watched it I won­dered if we could ever be able to sus­tain­ably do the same for our chil­dren. I am re­al­is­tic enough to know we don’t have the re­sources to pro­vide the same equip­ment and to also know that even in China not all schools would be that priv­i­leged. I, how­ever, be­lieve in the child’s right to health and ed­u­ca­tion enough to know we can try. We will beat this!

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201215,Let’s all have a green vi­sion,"AS one of the coun­tries al­ready suf­fer­ing from cli­mate change caused by global warm­ing, with more drought years and more de­struc­tive cy­clones than his­tor­i­cal records sug­gest was the norm, Zim­babwe has more in­cen­tives than its treaty obli­ga­tions to ful­fil tar­gets set by the Paris Agree­ment five years ago. In a vir­tual sum­mit mark­ing the fifth an­niver­sary of that agree­ment, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa made it clear at the week­end that Zim­babwe was tar­get­ing a 40 per­cent drop in car­bon emis­sions by 2050. This tar­get, it must be re­mem­bered, is a tar­get set by a de­vel­op­ing and in­dus­tri­al­is­ing coun­try that needs to grow rapidly, in­creas­ing the size of its econ­omy sev­eral fold by the same date. So, it is not just fig­ur­ing out how to cut present emis­sions by switch­ing tech­nolo­gies and build­ing up car­bon sinks. It is how we can, on just over half our present emis­sions, pro­duce far more elec­tric­ity, how to pro­duce all the ce­ment we need to build ev­ery­one a de­cent house and build the fac­to­ries that must be con­structed, how to run our in­dus­tries, and how to build up our fleet of trucks and cars to the lev­els of a devel­oped coun­try. Zim­babwe is a small coun­try, and not highly-devel­oped, so our present emis­sions as a per­cent­age of the global to­tal are just a tiny blip on the graph. But the Paris Agree­ment was a global deal, care­fully crafted to be fair to all, and com­mits ev­ery­one to slash­ing car­bon emis­sions. So, while the ma­jor gains come from the cuts of big in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries, even the lit­tle coun­tries have to add their share. For Zim­babwe, the ma­jor chal­lenge will be how to in­dus­tri­alise and grow within ever de­creas­ing lim­its of car­bon emis­sions. The Paris Agree­ment did ad­dress this is­sue. The de­vel­op­ing world was not con­demned to per­pet­ual poverty and the right of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to move from low-in­come sta­tus to mid­dle-in­come sta­tus to up­per-in­come sta­tus was recog­nised as a fun­da­men­tal right. This re­quires the huge de­vel­op­ment needed across the Third World to be done dif­fer­ently from how the big in­dus­trial pow­ers of to­day devel­oped, and that group in­cludes the lat­est gi­ant of China. We have to use dif­fer­ent and bet­ter tech­nolo­gies, and of­ten more ex­pen­sive tech­nolo­gies, to ac­cel­er­ate our eco­nomic growth with­out wreck­ing our planet, while we do this. One plank of the Paris Agree­ment was the Green Cli­mate Fund, set up to help poorer coun­tries to cut their present emis­sions and to af­ford the tech­nolo­gies they need to grow re­spon­si­bly. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, while thank­ing the fund for the US$3 million Zim­babwe has al­ready re­ceived, which has largely been used on re­quired re­search and plan­ning, quite rightly ap­pealed for greatly in­creased con­tri­bu­tions. The Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1, cov­er­ing de­vel­op­ment from next year to 2025, does, as the Pres­i­dent stressed — com­mit Zim­babwe to green growth. In the fi eld of en­ergy, and we do need to more than dou­ble our elec­tric­ity out­put, the stress was on hy­dro-power, so­lar power and bio­gas. Zim­babwe and Zam­bia are now com­mit­ted to build­ing the Ba­toka hy­dro scheme on the Zam­bezi River be­tween the Vic­to­ria Falls gorges and Lake Kariba. That pro­vides a huge surge in gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­ity for the two de­vel­op­ing nations, al­though op­ti­mism needs to be tem­pered by the grow­ing fluc­tu­a­tions in re­gional rain­fall. We have al­ready seen what suc­ces­sive se­vere re­gional droughts have done to the Kariba out­put, and sim­i­lar fluc­tu­a­tions will have the same ef­fect on Bakota. So­lar power is an ob­vi­ous way for­ward for a trop­i­cal coun­try, and the plans in­clude US$250 million to be spent on off-grid power. This is needed in any case as part of our ma­jor drive to boost ir­ri­ga­tion and ru­ral stan­dards of liv­ing. In fact, so­lar power is ide­ally suited for ir­ri­ga­tion, since wa­ter can be pumped when it is sunny and on cloudy rainy days, when gen­er­a­tion drops, you need to pump less in any case e third big en­ergy scheme is to har­ness Harare’s garbage, and there is a lot of garbage in what is eas­ily our big­gest city. This at the mo­ment rots on badly-main­tained land­fills, pump­ing meth­ane, a se­ri­ous green­house gas far more de­struc­tive than car­bon diox­ide, into the at­mos­phere and help­ing to trig­ger bad fires that are not just a safety is­sue, but pump even more car­bon into the air. There is es­tab­lished tech­nol­ogy that can gen­er­ate elec­tric­ity via bio­gas from a prop­erly de­signed plant, giv­ing three si­mul­ta­ne­ous ben­e­fits: more elec­tric­ity, fewer emis­sions, and safe and in­ert re­mains that can be safely buried in land­fills. In some cases, de­vel­op­ment ac­tu­ally cuts car­bon emis­sions. Bring­ing ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties out of poverty, for ex­am­ple, cuts back heav­ily on fire­wood and char­coal con­sump­tion, to lev­els where re­for­esta­tion out­strips wood con­sump­tion, giv­ing us a net gain in our big­gest car­bon sink. New tech­nolo­gies un­der de­vel­op­ment and im­ple­men­ta­tion should al­low Zim­babwe to grow fast with­out more car­bon. One ex­am­ple is elec­tric ve­hi­cles. Th­ese are a small, but fast grow­ing fac­tion of the global ve­hi­cle fleet and am­bi­tious plans in ma­jor ve­hi­cle-pro­duc­ing coun­tries see a to­tal re­place­ment of the world’s ve­hi­cle fleet well be­fore 2050. Zim­babwe needs to be right up there, de­vel­op­ing its ve­hi­cle in­dus­try for the new prod­ucts. Here we have an­other in­cen­tive; with our large lithium re­sources we can profit from the huge surge in bat­tery de­mand. Our in­dus­tri­al­ists will have to be think­ing about en­ergy ef­fi­cien­cies. To some ex­tent this will be au­to­matic, with our re­treat from sub­si­dies and cost­ing elec­tric­ity at the cor­rect fig­ure, but again there might be is­sues of ac­cess to tech­nolo­gies, some of which can be home­grown, but some of which will need pro­cesses care­fully patented by their de­vel­op­ers. Hav­ing a ra­tio­nal roy­alty sys­tem for those tech­nolo­gies will be needed, along with Green Cli­mate Fund as­sis­tance to ac­tu­ally help pay for them in the first place. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s ad­dress to the an­niver­sary sum­mit was sober and hit the right points: Zim­babwe ac­knowl­edges its obli­ga­tions to cut emis­sions, Zim­babwe is al­ready plan­ning its rapid eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment along green routes, and this de­vel­op­ment will be a lot eas­ier if the Green Cli­mate Fund and other fi­nan­cial in­ter­ven­tions are in­creased. But all of this re­quires all Zim­bab­weans to be think­ing green, and for our grow­ing tech­nol­ogy base to be at the fore­front of de­vel­op­ing our own tech­nolo­gies and pro­cesses, since we know we can­not rely purely on hand­outs and give-aways, and to carry on what we have started to do, en­sure our am­bi­tious plans for de­vel­op­ment at lo­cal and na­tional level fit in with our com­mit­ment.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150918,Sound poli­cies key to Zim growth post-dol­lar­i­sa­tion,"THIS week we take a closer look at Mozam­bique. As in­di­cated last week, these ar­ti­cles high­light the progress a num­ber of coun­tries in Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa have made over the last two decades and the lessons we can learn. These coun­tries are by no means per­fect ex­am­ples as ev­ery coun­try has its chal­lenges, but we can learn as much from their fail­ures as we should from their suc­cesses. Zim­babwe needs to de­fine its own eco­nomic model and pol­icy based on its own phi­los­o­phy, ide­ol­ogy, val­ues and prin­ci­ples. Once clearly de­fined, in­vestors can de­cide whether they wish to in­vest in the coun­try or not. In any en­vi­ron­ment and more so in a dol­larised econ­omy, it is im­per­a­tive to de­velop an en­vi­ron­ment that fos­ters growth and de­vel­op­ment and en­cour­ages for­eign in­vest­ment. In the ab­sence of do­mes­tic liq­uid­ity and sav­ings, at­tract­ing for­eign in­vest­ment be­comes crit­i­cal to sus­tain long-term de­vel­op­ment. Much has been writ­ten about the loss of com­pet­i­tive­ness due to the weak­ness in the South African rand. Zim­babwe is the only coun­try in Africa to adopt full dol­lar­i­sa­tion. While it is a bit­ter pill to swal­low it pro­vides sought-af­ter sta­bil­ity for in­vestors. It is sur­pris­ing that we have not seen greater in­ter­est from South African-based in­vestors look­ing to di­ver­sify risk, but re­cent an­nounce­ments re­gard­ing the in­vest­ment in Cairns and Blue Rib­bon Foods are en­cour­ag­ing. In­vestors are start­ing to pay closer at­ten­tion to Zim­babwe and we need to build on the good­will of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to­wards Zim­babwe. So let us see what we can learn from Mozam­bique. Mozam­bique’s an­nual Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct (GDP) growth av­er­aged 7,4% over the past two decades. Sound macro-eco­nomic man­age­ment, large-scale for­eign in­vest­ment projects, po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and sig­nif­i­cant donor sup­port have con­trib­uted sig­nif­i­cantly to such per­for­mance. How­ever, the rapid growth of the past decades has not al­ways trans­lated into sig­nif­i­cant poverty re­duc­tion. Strong eco­nomic growth was ac­com­pa­nied by large de­creases in poverty un­til the early 2000s. The na­tional poverty head­count fell by 14 per­cent­age points be­tween 1997 and 2003 to 56%, while in­come per capita grew by 36% dur­ing the same pe­riod. In con­trast, poverty fell by only 4% be­tween 2003 and 2009, a much slower rate of de­cline. The weak­ened re­la­tion­ship be­tween growth and poverty re­duc­tion is due to the chang­ing pat­tern of growth, which in the past decade was driven by cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive, im­port-de­pen­dent sec­tors. This pat­tern of growth is also re­flected in labour mar­kets, which con­tinue to be dom­i­nated by low skilled labour in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. Mean­while, the rest of the econ­omy is un­able to of­fer bet­ter-pay­ing jobs for the 300 000 new work­ers en­ter­ing the labour force ev­ery year. Re­cent dis­cov­er­ies of large de­posits of coal and gas may trans­form Mozam­bique into a sig­nif­i­cant player in global mar­kets. How­ever, in or­der for Mozam­bique to reap the ben­e­fits of a grow­ing re­source sec­tor it will need to de­velop the ca­pac­ity to man­age the coun­try’s ex­trac­tive in­dus­tries and en­sure that they con­trib­ute to sus­tain­able and broad-based growth. Re­cent “mega-projects” in coal, min­eral sands and nat­u­ral gas ex­trac­tion and pro­cess­ing have thus far had only a lim­ited im­pact on em­ploy­ment and poverty re­duc­tion. Some of the chal­lenges ahead in­clude the for­mu­la­tion of strate­gies for de­vel­op­ing Mozam­bique’s coal and nat­u­ral gas re­serves, de­ter­min­ing how these in­dus­tries in­ter­act with other eco­nomic sec­tors, and en­sur­ing that the ex­pected in­crease in nat­u­ral re­source rev­enues are used in the most ef­fec­tive way, avoid­ing the fate of many other nat­u­ral re­source-rich coun­tries, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe. Since 2000 Mozam­bique has raised over US$18,7 bil­lion while Zam­bia has raised over US$11,5bn. Dur­ing this pe­riod Zim­babwe has raised less than US$2bn. In the last two years, Mozam­bique has raised over US$11,5bn fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of the coal and gas de­posits. Zim­babwe has abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources and could easily at­tract sim­i­lar if not bet­ter lev­els of for­ein di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI). Be­fore the multi-cur­rency sys­tem, rais­ing FDI was not so crit­i­cal as gov­ern­ment to could print money to sup­port the econ­omy and in­vest­ment. In a dol­larised en­vi­ron­ment that is not pos­si­ble. We can ei­ther rely on do­mes­tic sav­ings to spur in­vest­ment or open our econ­omy to for­eign in­vestors. Once again, it is crit­i­cal to de­fine an in­vest­ment pol­icy that is syn­ony­mous to the needs of in­vestors while en­sur­ing there is ap­pro­pri­ate lo­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion. Ul­ti­mately, com­mu­ni­ties should ben­e­fit from in­ward in­vest­ment through job cre­ation and mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial eq­uity par­tic­i­pa­tion. In­vestors (do­mes­tic or in­ter­na­tional) would nat­u­rally be re­luc­tant to re­lin­quish ma­jor­ity stake at the on­set. Struc­tural re­forms, sound macroe­co­nomic poli­cies, open­ing up to the global econ­omy and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity have gen­er­ated strong growth since Mozam­bique emerged from the civil war and started its tran­si­tion from a con­trolled to a mar­ket econ­omy. Zim­babwe can learn much from the ex­pe­ri­ences of Mozam­bique, Zam­bia, Kenya and Tan­za­nia. Over the last two decades, these coun­tries have trans­formed their economies through the adop­tion of open mar­ket eco­nomic poli­cies. They have de­vel­oped sta­ble macro-eco­nomic con­di­tions and an in­vestor-friendly en­vi­ron­ment. The re­cent slow­down in the global econ­omy, es­pe­cially China, is likely to have a neg­a­tive im­pact on num­ber of African economies in the short-term. Zam­bia is al­ready show­ing signs of weak­ness with the cur­rency de­pre­ci­at­ing over 30% in re­cent months. De­spite the short-term weak­ness these coun­tries have laid the foun­da­tions for sus­tain­able long-term growth and de­vel­op­ment. Zim­babwe needs to build on the foun­da­tions it al­ready has post-dol­lar­i­sa­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160629,Sino-Africa co­op­er­a­tion: Tak­ing stock,"AFRICA-CHINA re­la­tions date as far back as the 3rd cen­tury AD His­to­ri­ans pos­tu­late that there had been ex­plo­rations by the Chi­nese to eastern Africa specif­i­cally So­ma­lia, Tan­za­nia and Kenya where it is also be­lieved that they traded with one an­other.

We can even see how close Africa and China worked to­gether in their bid to join the United Na­tions. While other na­tions at­tempted to block the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China from join­ing the United Na­tions be­cause The Repub­lic of China or Chi­nese Taipei as it is re­ferred to nowa­days was al­ready a mem­ber of the United Na­tions. African coun­tries were in­stru­men­tal in back­ing the res­o­lu­tion pre­sented by Al­ba­nia in 1971 to recog­nise and ad­mit the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China and ex­pel Chi­nese Taipei. And soon af­ter that China em­barked on the largest sin­gle for­eign-aid project in Africa which was the con­struc­tion of the Tan­za­nia Zam­bia Rail­way or TAZARA. It was built at a cost of $500 mil­lion, which was 25 per­cent of the to­tal gov­ern­ment ex­pen­di­ture, from 1970-75 and runs from Dar-es-salaam to Kapiri Mposhi. The idea be­hind TAZARA was to elim­i­nate Zam­bia’s eco­nomic de­pen­dence on Rhode­sia which now is Zimbabwe and South Africa. South Africa im­posed sanc­tions on Zam­bia for sup­port­ing those fight­ing the Apartheid regime and made it dif­fi­cult to im­port and export their goods through the port of Dur­ban and the build­ing of the line af­forded Zam­bia ac­cess to the port of Dar in­creas­ing their im­port and export ca­pac­ity. China has a pop­u­la­tion of around 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple to Africa’s 1,26 bil­lion and yet Africa still depends heav­ily on China for trade and in­vest­ment. China’s GDP in 2015 to­talled more than $10 tril­lion while Africa’s was only about $2,6 tril­lion and in 2015 China over­took The United States of Amer­ica in for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments. For­eign firms in­vested over $128 bil­lion in China while in the United States they in­vested $86 bil­lion. This clearly demon­strates China’s eco­nomic might and an ideal part­ner for Africa. To­day China is Africa’s big­gest trad­ing part­ner. The vol­ume of trade be­tween Africa and China hit a new high of $200 bil­lion in 2015. This in­cluded a 44 per­cent growth spurt in Chi­nese di­rect in­vest­ment in Africa. Africa is a major con­trib­u­tor to China’s econ­omy sup­ply­ing over 1/3rd of China’s energy re­quire­ments. Also it ac­quires other raw ma­te­ri­als from Africa such as cot­ton from Mali, Burk­ina Faso and Benin, Co­coa from the Ivory Coast, cof­fee from Kenya, fish from Namibia and so on. But China’s largest industry in Africa is in the ser­vice industry where we have seen a boom in terms of whole­sale and re­tail stores, restau­rants, ho­tels and fur­ni­ture. At a gov­ern­men­tal level, China funds a vast ma­jor­ity of African coun­tries in­fra­struc­ture projects. The trans­port net­works in Africa have been greatly im­proved thanks to China as well as the con­struc­tion of build­ings and even schools and hos­pi­tals. And de­spite all that Chi­nas has done for Africa for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment from China to Africa ac­counts for 5-7 per­cent of the to­tal for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment that Africa receives per an­num. We were pleased to wit­ness at the end of last year Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s an­nounce­ment of a pack­age to Africa in the amount of $60 bil­lionth soft loans and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance. This will aid greatly in the vast num­ber of projects be­ing un­der­taken in Africa. China also pro­vides a means for the ed­u­ca­tion of African Stu­dents. At present there are es­ti­mated to be around 150 000 African stu­dents study­ing in Chi­nese uni­ver­si­ties and the knowl­edge that they gar­ner from there is in­valu­able and once they have com­pleted they can re­turn back to Africa and as­sist in the growth of our con­ti­nent. China is also pur­su­ing greater re­la­tion­ships with African ‘think tanks’ so as to im­prove and help im­ple­ment poli­cies on so­cial, po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and mil­i­tary is­sues. Air trans­port be­tween China and Africa has been in­creas­ing at an av­er­age of 15 per­cent each year. China South­ern and other air­lines have be­gun di­rect flights from China to Africa. Ethiopian Air­lines, which has been fly­ing to China since 1973, and Kenya Air­ways are the major air­lines fly­ing to China from Africa. Even still fewer than 30 per­cent of air travellers be­tween China and Africa are tak­ing di­rect flights to and from China, in­stead pre­fer­ring to tran­sit through Asia and Europe. There is def­i­nitely am­ple room for growth in this sec­tor for air­lines wish­ing to cap­i­talise on China Africa routes. Also the con­struc­tion of rail­way sys­tems in var­i­ous African coun­tries will help re­duce the cost of trans­porta­tion as well as in­crease im­port and export routes through the re­gion. The con­struc­tion of the Nairobi-Mom­basa stan­dard gauge rail­way at an es­ti­mated cost of $3,8 bil­lion as well as the Abuja-Kaduna rail project is es­ti­mated to cost $874 mil­lion are ex­am­ples of just how im­por­tant China and African coun­tries alike un­der­stand the im­por­tance of de­vel­op­ing the rail­way sys­tem in Africa. At a con­ti­nen­tal level Sino-Africa re­la­tions have been strength­ened through the cre­ation of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion or FOCAC. This fo­rum was cre­ated back in 2000 was ini­ti­ated to so­lid­ify the bond be­tween Africa and China and en­able Africa to learn and grow from China in ar­eas such as food se­cu­rity, agri­cul­ture and in­fra­struc­ture. We were pleased to wit­ness at the end of last year Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s an­nounce­ment of a loan and aid pack­age for Africa in the amount of $60 bil­lion for the next 3 years. This will help greatly in the implementation and com­ple­tion of a num­ber of in­fra­struc­ture and de­vel­op­ment pro­grams slated in dif­fer­ent African coun­tries. Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping an­nounced that China will roll out 10 major plans to boost co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in the com­ing three years. Propos­ing to lift the China-Africa relationship to a com­pre­hen­sive strategic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship in a key­note speech at the open­ing cer­e­mony of the sec­ond summit of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC), Pres­i­dent Xi said the pro­grams are aimed at car­ry­ing out the up­grade. The plan cov­ers the ar­eas of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, financial ser­vices, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion and pub­lic wel­fare, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and peace and se­cu­rity. The pro­grams, stressed the pres­i­dent, will fo­cus on help­ing African coun­tries break the three de­vel­op­ment set­backs of back­ward in­fra­struc­ture, tal­ent short­age and in­ad­e­quate fund, ac­cel­er­ate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, and re­alise in­de­pen­dent and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. As re­gards the lack of skilled per­son­nel, Xi said China will es­tab­lish a num­ber of re­gional vo­ca­tional ed­u­ca­tion cen­ters and sev­eral ca­pac­ity-build­ing col­leges for Africa, train 200 000 tech­ni­cians for African coun­tries, and pro­vide the con­ti­nent with 40 000 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in China. Mean­while, China will of­fer African stu­dents 2 000 ed­u­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties with de­grees or diplo­mas and 30 000 gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ships, he said, adding that each year his coun­try will also in­vite 200 African schol­ars to visit China and 500 African youths to study in China each year and train 1 000 me­dia pro­fes­sion­als from Africa. — African Ex­ec­u­tive. ◆ Mr Eras­tus Mwen­cha is Deputy Chair­per­son of the AU Commission.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150904,AfDB head Akinwumi Adesina warns of global risks to Africa,"Africa needs to make sure it gets “the best deal pos­si­ble” for its nat­u­ral re­source ex­ports, par­tic­u­larly with its largest trad­ing part­ner China, to pro­tect it­self from global mar­ket tur­bu­lence, ac­cord­ing to the new pres­i­dent of the African De­vel­op­ment Bank. Akinwumi Adesina, who takes over on Tues­day as the head of the AfDB, told the Fi­nan­cial Times in an in­ter­view that China’s “mar­ket as­set price cor­rec­tion” is hit­ting African economies hard, par­tic­u­larly those with “very high ex­po­sure” such as the con­ti­nent’s top crude oil, iron ore and alu­minium pro­duc­ers. For the past decade, Africa has been home to some of the world’s fastest grow­ing economies, some of which will strug­gle to nav­i­gate global mar­ket tur­moil. “There’s no doubt that most of Africa’s eco­nomic growth has been tied to that com­modi­ties su­per cy­cle” that saw China’s econ­omy grow sig­nif­i­cantly over the past decade, said Mr Adesina. “China is Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner [and] we just have to make sure that we man­age the cur­rent volatil­i­ties and make sure that Africa is get­ting the best deal pos­si­ble,” he said. For now, “be­cause of the terms of trade a num­ber of [African] coun­tries will wit­ness cur­rent ac­count deficits and the fact that rev­enue streams have gone down will mean many will face do­mes­tic fis­cal deficits,” he said, adding that de­pre­ci­at­ing cur­ren­cies could also drive up in­fla­tion. One po­ten­tial “bright side”, he said, was “the rise of in­dus­trial wages in China open­ing a huge op­por­tu­nity for Chi­nese com­pa­nies to ac­tu­ally move out of China and set up in­dus­tries in Africa be­cause of low wages”. A tech­no­crat who most re­cently served as Nige­ria’s agri­cul­ture min­is­ter and won praise for his com­mer­cially minded re­forms, Mr Adesina - elected by the board in May - is the first Nige­rian to lead the bank. He takes over from Don­ald Kaberuka, who led the bank for 10 years. Mr Kaberuka, a for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter in Rwanda, presided over a dra­matic ex­pan­sion of the bank’s in­flu­ence and cap­i­tal, helped in part by high com­mod­ity prices. The new pres­i­dent said he aimed to lead a bank that was “more nim­ble and there­fore re­spon­sive to the needs of its clients”. He said he wanted “Africans to say, this is Africa’s de­vel­op­ment bank, not just in terms of the amount of money we dis­pose but [the] im­pact on peo­ple”. Eas­ing the im­pact of ex­ter­nal volatil­i­ties will be one of the bank’s pri­or­i­ties, Mr Adesina said. Greater in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and diver­si­fi­ca­tion was crit­i­cal to this ef­fort, he said. “Africa to­day is at the bot­tom of the value chain in many of the com­modi­ties it ex­ports”, in­clud­ing agri­cul­tural prod­ucts, he said. “He said the con­ti­nent had no choice “but to di­ver­sify its economies very fast”. &amp;lt; The tab­u­lar con­tent re­lat­ing to this ar­ti­cle is not avail­able to view. Apolo­gies in ad­vance for the in­con­ve­nience caused. To that end, he said the bank “will make a sig­nif­i­cant ef­fort to work with oth­ers” such as fel- low mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment banks, African gov­ern­ments, in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, and the pri­vate sec­tor to solve Africa’s energy cri­sis. A re­cent study com­mis­sioned by a panel chaired by for­mer UN sec­re­tary-gen­eral Kofi An­nan found that about 600m sub-Sa­ha­ran Africans lack ac­cess to elec­tric­ity. Pick­ing up on a theme em­pha­sised by his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Adesina said “in­clu­sive growth” would be a core theme of his work. He said it was crit­i­cal to ad­dress “rapidly grow­ing in­equal­i­ties” in Africa. Another pri­or­ity would be en­cour­ag­ing agri­cul­tural re­forms to raise pro­duc­tiv­ity. “Agri­cul­ture is go­ing to be the key to lift­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty” and that coun­tries need to diver-",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190628,SMEs tran­si­tion crit­i­cal in steer­ing the econ­omy,"The In­ter­na­tional Small and Medium En­ter­prises ( SMEs) Day is ob­served every year across the world on June 27 to cel­e­brate the strong con­tri­bu­tion of small busi­nesses in growth and de­vel­op­ment of any econ­omy. The day marks the im­por­tance of SMEs in the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try in terms of cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment. Day 2019 is ded­i­cated to raisSME ing aware­ness of the need for greater in­vest­ment into small- and mid-sized busi­nesses in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries but it is also a cel­e­bra­tion of the gi­gan­tic con­tri­bu­tion smaller com­pa­nies make to the global econ­omy, of­ten away from the spot­light. Recog­nis­ing the im­por­tance of SMEs in achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals and in pro­mot­ing in­no­va­tion, creativ­ity and sus­tain­able work for all, the United Na­tions Gen­eral As­sem­bly in its 74th Ple­nary held on April 6, 2017 de­clared June 27 as Day. SME There is no uni­ver­sally ac­cepted def­i­ni­tion of SMEs in the world but the World Bank de­fines SMEs as busi­nesses that em­ploy less than 300 peo­ple and have an an­nual turnover that does not ex­ceed US$ 15 mil­lion. In the UK, SMEs em­ploy less than 250 peo­ple and in China or USA, the num­ber can go up to 3 000 de­pend­ing on the sec­tor. In Zim­babwe, clas­si­fies SMEs ZIMRA as busi­nesses that em­ploy be­tween five and 40 peo­ple with an­nual turnover and as­sets from as low as $50 000 to $2 mil­lion. Ac­cord­ing to the data pro­vided by the In­ter­na­tional Coun­cil for Small Busi­ness ( ICSB), for­mal and in­for­mal SMEs make up over 90 per­cent of all firms and ac­count on av­er­age for 60-70 per­cent of to­tal em­ploy­ment and 50 per­cent of GDP. In Zim­babwe, SMEs make up more than 70 per­cent of all busi­nesses; em­ploy 60 per­cent of the coun­try’s work­force while con­tribut­ing above 50 per­cent to Zim­babwe’s GDP. The im­pact of SMEs on the coun­try’s econ­omy can­not be over­looked. They con­trib­ute largely, not just to the fis­cus, but con­tinue to fill the gap in pro­vid­ing ser­vices and prod­ucts es­pe­cially as the coun­try is fac­ing short­ages of var­i­ous com­modi­ties. While the SMEs sec­tor has car­ried the weight on them­selves to sus­tain the coun­try’s trade and in­dus­try, they are fall­ing short of the nec­es­sary tools to fully en­gage in more mean­ing­ful busi­ness ven­tures. In Zim­babwe, skilled trades have be­come a ca­reer for most peo­ple, ex­er­cis­ing their pro­fi­ciency in fields of weav­ing, sculpt­ing, car­pen­try, plumbing, build­ing, elec­tron­ics, and met­al­work, among others. Fur­ther­more, SMEs now make up over 70 per­cent of ZIMRA’s data­base of reg­is­tered tax­pay­ers while con­tribut­ing only 20 per­cent in taxes. How­ever, de­spite this con­tri­bu­tion, SMEs in the coun­try con­tinue to fail to tran­si­tion to big busi­nesses mainly due to their in­for­mal na­ture, and the lack of fi­nan­cial and busi­ness train­ing, and fail­ure to ac­cess fi­nan­cial sup­port from bank­ing in­sti­tu­tions. Ac­cord­ing to the cen­tral bank, only 3,78 per­cent of the to­tal loans and ad­vances by Zim­bab­wean banks go to­wards the SMEs sec­tor. The key chal­lenge in the coun­try is that only a few SMEs evolve to big busi­nesses that can be ac­counted for in the for­mal econ­omy. The rest stay as SMEs and evolve from one spe­cialty to the other till they die with the owner(s) or are taken over by new man­age­ment. For in­stance, pro­gres­sion of en­ti­ties such as Nash Paints, Untu Cap­i­tal, Road An­gels, Pa­cific To­bacco, Gtel and Sur­face Wil­mar in the last decade shows real cases of creativ­ity that is rare in strug­gling economies the world over. This im­plies that if the Gov­ern­ment put in place the right poli­cies, these suc­cess sto­ries can be sim­u­lated across all in­dus­tries in the econ­omy. Worth not­ing also is that all com­mer­cial banks and re­tail en­ter­prises in Zim­babwe now have a ded­i­cated SMEs Desk sig­ni­fy­ing the role small busi­nesses are play­ing in the lo­cal mar­ket. SMEs mainly lack cap­i­tal to ex­pand their op­er­a­tions in line with growth in prod­uct de­mand. Var­i­ous ini­tia­tives by the Small En­ter­prises De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion ( SEDCO), ZimTrade, lo­cal banks, cor­po­rates and RBZ (Na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­clu­sion Strat­egy) aimed at ca­pac­i­tat­ing SMEs, women, the youth and ru­ral busi­nesses re­quire Gov­ern­ment sup­port. By sup­port­ing SMEs through sus­tain­able poli­cies, the coun­try can im­prove on the much needed tran­si­tion of the econ­omy. Far-reach­ing ben­e­fits such as poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion, de­vel­op­ment of marginalised re­gions and growth in the tax base can­not be un­der­es­ti­mated. The Deputy Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral’s UN SME Com­petive­ness Out­look 2019 yes­ter­day noted that SMEs are the first re­spon­ders to so­ci­etal needs as there are re­spon­si­ble for sig­nif­i­cant em­ploy­ment and in­come gen­er­a­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties across the world and have been iden­ti­fied as a ma­jor driver of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment. “Mi­cro, small and medium-sized busi­nesses are key to cre­at­ing the 600 mil­lion new jobs needed by 2030 to keep pace with the growth of the world’s work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion.” Reg­is­tered and com­pli­ant SMEs should also be re­warded with sup­ply con­tracts as a de­vel­op­ment strat­egy rather than im­port vir­tu­ally all prod­ucts and ser­vices from the de­vel­oped coun­tries. All im­ports into Zim­babwe rep­re­sent thou­sands of jobs lost at home and cre­ated in the ex­port­ing coun­try. Lo­cal banks should ex­tend com­pet­i­tive in­ter­est rates to SMEs that can al­low them to grow grad­u­ally and in­vest in their busi­nesses. Lessons should also be drawn from de­vel­oped economies where cheap fa­cil­i­ties ex­ist for small busi­nesses. In the USA, In­dia and China, tech hubs and ex­port zones have been es­tab­lished. In Ethiopia, the Hawassa In­dus­trial Park stands out as a clas­sic African model. Ba­sic in­fra­struc­ture such as wa­ter, elec­tric­ity and se­cu­rity are pro­vided for at sub­sidised rates at these in­dus­trial parks. The idea of hous­ing SMEs un­dert one in­dus­trial park will earn Gov­ern­ment bil­lions in for­eign cur­rency through ex­ports. On top of Gov­ern­ment sup­port, SMEs should join hands and pool re­sources which they can de­posit with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in the coun­try. These re­sources then can be used by mem­bers as col­lat­eral in ex­change for loans to ex­pand their busi­nesses.",津巴布韦

The call comes at a time when G20 mem­bers are con­ven­ing re­motely through video con­fer­enc­ing fol­low­ing the out­break of Covid19, which be­gan in China last De­cem­ber and has spread across the world, killing more than 21 000 peo­ple. As global lead­ers are ex­pected to as­sess the eco­nomic and so­cial im­pact of the pan­demic, there are fears this will heav­ily af­fect de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, home to a quar­ter of the world’s pop­u­la­tion and two-thirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, which liv­ing in ex­treme poverty.

The project has al­ready cre­ated over 300 jobs for lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties. Work on the con­struc­tion of the 5MW plant at Cross Ma­bale in Hwange to be fed into the na­tional grid, is at an ad­vanced stage de­spite Covid-19 in­duced de­lays and dif­fi­cul­ties in ac­cess­ing for­eign cur­rency. “Af­ter reach­ing full fi­nan­cial clo­sure in Fe­bru­ary 2018, we had ex­pected to com­mis­sion the project by end of May, but be­cause of Covid-19 in­spired de­lays, not just in the coun­try but out­side as well like in China and South Africa, where we im­port most of our equip­ment like the top tier seraphim pan­els, we have had to push that up to end of Au­gust,” said Mr Mundicha dur­ing a me­dia tour of the fa­cil­ity re­cently. Solgas En­ergy se­cured US$7m for the con­struc­tion of the 5MW so­lar plant, but Mr Mundicha said it was dif­fi­cult to ac­cess for­eign cur­rency from the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe un­til Fe­bru­ary this year. They we granted na­tional project sta­tus and re­ceived a lot of as­sis­tance from the Govern­ment. “We are ex­empt from duty and we also have a sta­tus, which al­lows us to raise money from pen­sion funds and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies. “The com­pany is wholly Zim­bab­wean and the money is also from Zim­babwe.

Once the funds are se­cured to pay our sup­pli­ers, the rest is easy for us and as you can see (the in­ter­view was done at the Hwange site) con­struc­tion is on­go­ing al­beit with lim­ited staff be­cause of Covid-19 mea­sures. If you came here in Fe­bru­ary, this was just a bush but by Au­gust, we will be com­mis­sion­ing,” he said. The com­pany quar­an­tined its on-site work­ers for 21 days, seven days more than the rec­om­mended 14, be­cause of Covid-19 and that lost them some pro­duc­tion time. The So­lar PV Plant has a to­tal ul­ti­mate val­u­a­tion of US$130mil­lion and Mr Mundicha said they have reached fi­nan­cial clo­sure for a fur­ther two projects val­ued at US$100 mil­lion, which are to go live by the end of 2021. The project is set to ben­e­fit the Hwange com­mu­nity with over 300 al­ready em­ployed at the site. “We are fo­cus­ing on Im­pact In­vest­ments through Re­new­able En­ergy and In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment with a so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to up­lift dis­ad­van­taged com­mu­ni­ties out of poverty. We will ac­tively look for ways to sup­port the lo­cal com­mu­nity through pro­vi­sion of elec­tric­ity and ed­u­ca­tion ini­tia­tives and we will try to start with the school next door. Over 300 peo­ple are al­ready em­ployed here from the Hwange com­mu­nity,” said Mr Mundicha. He added that they are on a jour­ney to part­ner with youths and women as dis­ad­van­taged groups in the process im­part­ing knowl­edge on how to de­velop and struc­ture sus­tain­able projects and com­pa­nies of to­mor­row aligned with SDGs and cli­mate change ini­tia­tives. As part of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, SolGas has also un­der­taken to clear 28km of the power line for the first 5MW and ex­pect to reach 81km as the project grows. Mr Mundicha is the SolGas chief fi­nance of­fi­cer and he co-founded the com­pany in 2015 with the Chief Oper­a­tions Of­fi­cer Pet­ros Kazunga.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191101,Eco­log­i­cal progress vi­tal for fu­ture gen­er­a­tion,"CHINA’S en­vi­ron­ment pol­icy in light of ris­ing con­cerns about cli­mate change and greater aware­ness of the need to pre­serve na­ture, even in a pe­riod of rapid in­dus­trial growth, car­ries sig­nif­i­cance. A ma­jor re­view of the eco­log­i­cal progress of the Asian gi­ant will show that it has made con­sid­er­able head­way in its ac­tions as well as ad­vo­cacy of eco­log­i­cal progress. Un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, China has im­proved eco­log­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment man­age­ment and gov­er­nance, and also freely shared its ex­pe­ri­ence with other na­tions. The change in weather pat­terns in re­cent years that has been ex­pe­ri­enced in Zim­babwe — pro­longed droughts and floods — has re­sulted in a neg­a­tive im­pact on the en­vi­ron­ment and has led to threats to hu­man se­cu­rity. It is thus im­per­a­tive for Zim­babwe to learn from its all-weather friends, as it is now widely known that the world is sig­nif­i­cantly un­der siege from a wide ar­ray of en­vi­ron­men­tal chal­lenges. For the coun­try to pros­per, the green econ­omy paradigm is nec­es­sary to over­come chal­lenges of sus­tain­abil­ity that the world is fac­ing to­day. Pres­i­dent Xi and his ad­min­is­tra­tion have put great im­por­tance to in­cor­po­rat­ing China’s eco­log­i­cal progress into ev­ery facet of so­cial, po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic and cul­tural de­vel­op­ment. In this re­gard, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has brought into ef­fect sev­eral ma­jor poli­cies that have pro­duced sig­nif­i­cant re­sults and this could be ben­e­fi­cial for present and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of Zim­babwe. The the­o­ries ap­pli­ca­ble to eco­log­i­cal progress, newly re­fined and ex­pressed in plain lan­guage, have raised pub­lic eco­log­i­cal aware­ness. It is pointed out, for ex­am­ple, that a healthy ecol­ogy nur­tures a pros­per­ous civil­i­sa­tion, that green hills and clean wa­ter are China’s gold and sil­ver mines, and that the eco­log­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment is a pro­duc­tive force. In his book, “The Gov­er­nance of China 1”, Pres­i­dent Xi said ef­forts for eco­log­i­cal con­ver­sa­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion will ben­e­fit fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. He said na­tions must take re­spon­si­ble at­ti­tude to­wards the peo­ple and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, be res­o­lute in con­trol­ling en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion, strive to usher in a new era of eco­log­i­cal progress and im­prove the en­vi­ron­ment for the peo­ple to live and work in. “Eco­log­i­cal progress is of vi­tal im­por­tance to the fu­ture of the na­tion and well-be­ing of its peo­ple,” he wrote. “The 18th Na­tional Congress of the of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) listed eco­log­i­cal progress along with eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal, cul­tural and so­cial progress as the five goals in the over­all plan for the cause of Chi­nese so­cial­ism, vow­ing to pro­mote eco­log­i­cal progress to build a beau­ti­ful China and achieve last­ing and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment of the Chi­nese na­tion. “We must raise aware­ness of the need to re­spect, pro­tect and ac­com­mo­date our­selves to na­ture, fol­low the ba­sic state pol­icy of re­source con­ver­sa­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion and give high pri­or­ity to con­serv­ing re­sources, pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and pro­mot­ing its nat­u­ral restora­tion. “We must ded­i­cate our­selves to rais­ing our eco­log­i­cal aware­ness, en­hanc­ing rel­e­vant sys­tems, safe­guard­ing eco­log­i­cal se­cu­rity, and im­prov­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. We must pre­serve our ge­o­graph­i­cal space and stream­line our in­dus­trial struc­ture, our mode of pro­duc­tion, and our way of life in the in­ter­est of re­source con­ser­va­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. “We must strike a bal­ance be­tween eco­nomic growth and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, and bear in mind that pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment equates to de­vel­op­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity. “We will be more con­sci­en­tious in pro­mot­ing green, cir­cu­lar and low-car­bon de­vel­op­ment. We will never again seek eco­nomic growth at the cost of the en­vi­ron­ment.” Pro­mot­ing eco­log­i­cal progress should be Zim­babwe’s in­evitable choice in re­flect­ing the coun­try’s sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity for global sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. ◆ Read full ar­ti­cle on www.herald.co.zw LAST week, news that 6 700 girls dropped out of Zim­babwe’s schools in 2018 af­ter they fell preg­nant or en­tered into un­in­tended mar­riages, broke out. Of con­cern is that of those drop-outs, 367 were from pri­mary schools, while 6 419 were from se­condary schools. In Zim­babwe, girls usu­ally com­plete their pri­mary school ed­u­ca­tion be­tween 12 and 13 years, a time when their bod­ies are not fully de­vel­oped to carry a preg­nancy, more­over go into labour. Such girls are at higher risk of birth com­pli­ca­tions that in­clude ob­stet­ric fis­tula — a hole be­tween the birth canal and rec­tum or blad­der, that is caused by pro­longed ob­structed labour, leav­ing a woman in­con­ti­nent of urine or fae­ces or both. Many other com­pli­ca­tions that may lead to death dur­ing or af­ter giv­ing birth have stalked the preg­nant teens. Young girls en­gag­ing in early and un­pro­tected sex are not just ex­posed to un­in­tended preg­nan­cies, but are also at higher risk of HIV in­fec­tion and sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted dis­eases. In the SADC re­gion, coun­tries like South Africa, Namibia and Mozam­bique are also bat­tling with un­planned teen preg­nan­cies. In South Africa, for ex­am­ple, 3 000 girl chil­dren aged be­tween 10 and 14 be­came mothers in 2017. Ac­cord­ing to IOL, the Recorded Live Births re­port, which is com­mis­sioned by Statis­tics South Africa, showed that a to­tal of 3 261 girl chil­dren aged be­tween 10 and 14 were reg­is­tered as mothers in South Africa in 2018. The re­port also re­vealed that there were more than 100 000 teenagers who gave birth in 2016 in South Africa. Namibia also faced the chal­lenge of teen preg­nan­cies, with the Khomas Re­gion record­ing 89 school preg­nan­cies in the first term of 2019, while 1 002 learn­ers fell preg­nant be­tween 2015 and 2018, ac­cord­ing to the Namib­ian Sun level of ado­les­cent preg­nancy. It is es­ti­mated at 101 births per 1 000 woman. news­pa­per. In Mozam­bique, child mar­riage and teen preg­nancy rates are among the high­est in the world. Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund (Unicef): “Mozam­bique, the coun­try has one of the high­est rates of child mar­riage in the world, af­fect­ing al­most one in ev­ery two girls, and has the sec­ond high­est rate in the east­ern and south­ern African sub-re­gion. “Some 48 per­cent of women in Mozam­bique aged be­tween 20 and 24 were first mar­ried or in a union be­fore the age of 18, and 14 per­cent be­fore the age of 15 (DHS, 2011).” Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions Pop­u­la­tion Fund (UNFPA) ev­ery day in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, 20 000 young girls un­der 18 give birth. This amounts to 7,3 mil­lion births a year. South­ern Africa has the high­est level of ado­les­cent preg­nancy. It is es­ti­mated at 101 births per 1 000 woman. The wor­ry­ing statis­tics on teen preg­nan­cies in the SADC re­gion come just a few weeks be­fore the world gath­ers in Nairobi, Kenya be­tween Novem­ber 12 and 14, 2019 for the 25th An­niver­sary of the Im­ple­men­ta­tion of ICPD Pro­gramme of Ac­tion which was adopted in Cairo, Egypt in 1994. The wa­ter­shed Cairo agree­ment has been the cor­ner­stone of the global re­pro­duc­tive rights move­ment for the past 25 years. At the Cairo meet­ing, Zim­babwe was one of the 179 gov­ern­ments that adopted a revo­lu­tion­ary Pro­gramme of Ac­tion (POA) and called for women’s re­pro­duc­tive health and rights to take cen­tre stage in na­tional and global de­vel­op­ment ef­forts. In an in­ter­view with The Herald, UNFPA Zim­babwe Coun­try Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Dr Es­ther Muia said sex­ual re­pro­duc­tive health re­mained cen­tral. She said be­cause of poverty and eco­nomic is­sues, trans­ac­tional sex has taken a ma­jor po­si­tion in young girls’ lives, ex­pos­ing them to HIV and also un­in­tended teen preg­nan­cies. “More ef­forts need to be driven to­wards this group,” said Dr Muia. “If we do not specif­i­cally tar­get this group, we are go­ing to get an­other gen­er­a­tion of an epi­demic that may be dif­fi­cult to erase be­cause of the large pro­por­tion of young peo­ple in the pop­u­la­tion.” To cap­ture this group, she said, it is im­por­tant to be in­no­va­tive and tar­get de­lib­er­ate pro­grammes that ad­dress needs of teenage girls. “The eco­nomic as­pect is crit­i­cal, if these girls are eco­nom­i­cally em­pow­ered, then they do not have to look for trans­ac­tional sex to sur­vive in aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions and also out­side,” said Dr Muia. “The other part is early mar­riages. I’m happy to say that one of the progress here in Zim­babwe is that there are favourable Bills now in Par­lia­ment await­ing to be moved for­ward like the Mar­riages Bill. Con­sent for mar­riage. What is the le­gal age for mar­riage? It used to be 16, now the Bill has rec­om­mended 18 and it’s on its way to be ac­cepted,” she ex­plained. “In the past when girls got preg­nant, they didn’t get back to school. The re­turn-to-school pol­icy now al­lows girls to go back to school af­ter they have had ba­bies. “When they have a baby and do not get back to school, the like­li­hood that they will con­tinue is still there. “But, now if they go back to school and they are coun­selled and there’s guid­ance, it will re­duce the num­ber of girls that will be­come vul­ner­a­ble to ei­ther get­ting in­fected or un­in­tended preg­nancy, drop­ping out of school and the vi­cious poverty cy­cle.” ◆ Read the full ar­ti­cle on www.herald. co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151205,China ex­tends $500m loan to Econet Wire­less,"ECONET Wire­less Global (EWG) has se­cured $500 mil­lion loan from China De­vel­op­ment Bank and ZTE, the bulk of which will be chan­nelled to­wards Econet Zim­babwe for mar­ket con­sol­i­da­tion, the com­pany said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. EWG is the par­ent com­pany for Econet Wire­less Zim­babwe. Econet Wire­less Zim­babwe chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Dou­glas Mboweni said the loan agree­ment was an­nounced in South Africa dur­ing a visit by Chi­nese Pres­i­dent XI Jin­ping this week. “Econet Wire­less Zim­babwe is set to get at least $300 mil­lion out of the new loan fa­cil­ity of $500 mil­lion that Econet Global has ne­go­ti­ated with China De­vel­op­ment Bank and ZTE,” he said. “The loan fa­cil­ity that had been ne­go­ti­ated at group level would help consolidate its mar­ket po­si­tion and also in­tro­duce new ser­vices.” The coun­try’s lead­ing telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion com­pany has since its es­tab­lish­ment in 1998 in­vested $1,2 bil­lion in de­vel­op­ing its net­work. “With this fa­cil­ity, we’ll take our in­vest­ment to well over $1,5 bil­lion. This shows our com­mit­ment to our coun­try,” said Mboweni. He said the deal had been ne­go­ti­ated at group level be­cause that is where the ex­per­tise lies to raise such kind of money. “At our group level, they’ve de­vel­oped a lot of ex­per­tise to raise large amounts of money when we need it. It’s one of our com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages,” said Mboweni. China is in­creas­ingly be­com­ing a key player in the coun­try’s econ­omy hav­ing in­vested mil­lions of dol­lars in de­vel­op­ment projects across eco­nomic sec­tors. Pres­i­dent Xi’s his­toric visit this week has also ce­mented the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ties be­tween the two coun­tries which also saw the gov­ern­ment seal­ing more that $4 bil­lion worth of deals in the en­ergy, in­fra­struc­ture and ICT sec­tors. Zim­babwe’s fruit­ful part­ner­ship with the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world vin­di­cates Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s “Look East pol­icy” that he enun­ci­ated in the wake of il­le­gal sanc­tions that were im­posed on the coun­try by the West since the turn of the mil­len­nium. re­port 2015, Mashona­land Cen­tral leads in child mar­riages with 50 per­cent,” said Cde Mathuthu.

She said it was ap­palling that a ma­jor­ity of child mar­riages are ini­ti­ated by fam­ily mem­bers and in­flu­en­tial lead­ers in com­mu­ni­ties. “Child mar­riages are a form of gen­der based violence and this form of abuse can have se­ri­ous short and long term phys­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal and so­cial con­se­quences, not only for girls but also for their fam­i­lies and com­mu­ni­ties,” she said. Cde Mathuthu said chil­dren forced into mar­riage face in­creased risk of HIV in­fec­tion and sex­u­ally trans­mit­ted diseases, greater risks of mis­car­riages and other com­pli­ca­tions dur­ing preg­nancy in­clud­ing death, school dropouts and per­pet­ual poverty.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151202,"Zim, China ink 12 land­mark deals","THE im­ple­men­ta­tion of Zim-As­set re­ceived a ma­jor boost and fresh im­pe­tus yes­ter­day fol­low­ing the sign­ing of 12 land­mark agree­ments be­tween Zim­babwe and China to fund vi­tal projects in key eco­nomic sec­tors. Zim-As­set is the Gov­ern­ment’s five-year eco­nomic blueprint tar­get­ing the cre­ation of 2,2 mil­lion jobs, among other de­liv­er­ables, by 2018. Two of the deals are pri­vate sec­tor-driven. The sign­ing of the new agree­ments, which cover key sec­tors such as in­fra­struc­ture, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and en­ergy was wit­nessed by Heads of State and Gov­ern­ment of the two coun­tries, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Xi Jin­ping. Pres­i­dent Xi is on a two-day State visit to Zim­babwe lead­ing a del­e­ga­tion of 200 peo­ple, in­clud­ing Cab­i­net min­is­ters, bankers and rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Com­mu­nist Party of China. This fol­lowed Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s suc­cess­ful 13th State visit to China in Au­gust last year, where an­other set of nine mega deals was signed with the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy af­ter the US. Some of the deals are at var­i­ous stages of im­ple­men­ta­tion. Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa penned four agree­ments on be­half of Zim­babwe with the first one be­ing an eco­nomic and tech­ni­cal co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment with China. Chi­nese Min­is­ter of Commerce Mr Gao Hucheng signed on be­half of his coun­try. The two also signed an agree­ment on avoid­ance of dou­ble tax­a­tion. Min­is­ter Chi­na­masa signed two loan agree­ments for the ex­pan­sion of Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion and TelOne’s fi­bre op­tic project with the chair­per­son of the China Ex­im­bank, Ms Hu Xiao­lian. On Hwange Power Sta­tion ex­pan­sion, the Zim­babwe Power Com­pany rep­re­sented by its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor En­gi­neer Noah Gwariro and Si­no­hy­dro rep­re­sented by chair­man of its par­ent com­pany, Power China, Mr Yan Zhiy­ong, signed a co-op­er­a­tion agree­ment on Hwange 7 and 8 project. The ex­pan­sion project at Hwange will see Si­no­hy­dro adding two units with a ca­pac­ity of 600 MW. Mr Gao signed four more deals on avi­a­tion co-op­er­a­tion with Trans­port and In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Jo­ram Gumbo and con­struc­tion of a na­tional phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ware­house with Health and Child Care Min­is­ter Dr David Parireny­atwa. He also signed a han­dover and ac­cep­tance of cer­tifi­cate on the do­na­tion of equip­ment for wildlife pro­tec­tion in Zim­babwe with En­vi­ron­ment, Wa­ter and Cli­mate Min­is­ter Op­pah Muchin­guri and an agree­ment on the ex­change of notes for the con­struc­tion of a new Par­lia­ment build­ing with Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment, Pub­lic Works and Na­tional Hous­ing Min­is­ter Saviour Ka­sukuwere. Pol­icy Co­or­di­na­tion and Pro­mo­tion of So­cio-Eco­nomic Ven­tures in the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice Min­is­ter, Si­mon Khaya Moyo signed an agree­ment with the chair­man of the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion chair­per­son Mr Xu Shaoshi on en­hance­ment of in­vest­ment. Two more pri­vate sec­tor agree­ments were also signed be­tween In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness of China and China Africa Sun­light En­ergy on the de­vel­op­ment of coal and methane gas mines as well the es­tab­lish­ment of 600MW ther­mal power sta­tion in Gwayi. The other agree­ment was be­tween AVM Africa Lim­ited and Beijing Au­to­mo­bile As­sem­bly. Ear­lier on, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe had de­scribed China as Zim­babwe’s best friend at in­ter­na­tional level. He said the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries was not premised on the fact that China was a rich coun­try, but that the Chi­nese were peo­ple of ac­tion. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe chron­i­cled the im­por­tant role that China played dur­ing the Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle by pro­vid­ing mil­i­tary and tech­ni­cal sup­port. “We had a tough strug­gle against the Bri­tish set­tlers and the Chi­nese as­sisted us with guns,” he said. “Ev­ery year I went to China to say we need more guns and more guns were given un­til we at­tained our in­de­pen­dence on 18 April 1980. “So as we host you here, this is your sec­ond coun­try be­cause China as­sisted us to at­tain our in­de­pen­dence.” Af­ter at­tain­ing po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said, Zim­babwe em­barked on an­other strug­gle to em­power peo­ple eco­nom­i­cally. He said Zim­babwe was seek­ing fi­nan- cial sup­port from the Chi­nese to con­vert the coun­try’s vast nat­u­ral re­sources into wealth. “We now have free­dom and the task at hand is to con­vert our nat­u­ral re­sources into wealth for our peo­ple,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “The main area of this strug­gle is fight­ing poverty and back­ward­ness. The other key ar­eas in­clude roads, rail and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment.” In re­sponse, Pres­i­dent Xi who was speak­ing through an in­ter­preter, said China placed high pre­mium to its re­la­tions with Zim­babwe. He said his visit, which was the only one on a bi­lat­eral level dur­ing his sec­ond visit to Africa, was in ful­fil­ment of the prom­ise that he made to Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe last year that Zim­babwe would be his first des­ti­na­tion on his sec­ond visit to Africa. “I am ful­fill­ing that prom­ise,” said Pres­i­dent Xi to deaf­en­ing ap­plause. “I was over­whelmed by the wel­come by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe and the peo­ple of Zim­babwe at the air­port. “Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe is a sea­soned states­man and a found­ing fa­ther of Africa who is re­spected across the con­ti­nent. In China, we also have the same peo­ple whom we hold in high re­gard.” Pres­i­dent Xi hailed Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe for lead­ing Zim­babwe on a de­vel­op­ment path and un­com­pro­mised stance to­wards ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence. He said the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries was premised on a mu­tual and win-win ba­sis. “Last year Zim­babwe and China agreed to be good friends and broth­ers on an equal foot­ing,” he said. “The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Zim­babwe and China has stood the test of time and is one of the best re­la­tion­ships be­tween the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.” Pres­i­dent Xi said it was his hope that Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe would lead the African Union to new heights as a re­spected states­man. For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Sim­barashe Mum­bengegwi and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Mr Wang Yi said the lead­ers had a suc­cess­ful meet­ing dur­ing a closed ses­sion at State House. Min­is­ter Mum­bengegwi said Beijing was an im­por­tant friend of Harare, which ve­toed a res­o­lu­tion by some Western pow­ers that sought to im­pose dev­as­tat­ing sanc­tions on Zim­babwe un­der the United Na­tions in 2008. Mr Yi said the visit by Pres­i­dent Xi gave im­pe­tus to the flour­ish­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween Zim­babwe and China. He said the two lead­ers agreed to up­grade the re­la­tion­ship from trade of pri­mary com­modi­ties to in­vest­ments and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion.",津巴布韦

Some of the deals are at var­i­ous stages of im­ple­men­ta­tion. Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa penned four agree­ments on be­half of Zim­babwe with the first one be­ing an eco­nomic and tech­ni­cal co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment with China. Chi­nese Min­is­ter of Commerce Gao Hucheng signed on be­half of his coun­try. The two also signed an agree­ment on avoid­ance of dou­ble tax­a­tion. Min­is­ter Chi­na­masa signed two loan agree­ments for the ex­pan­sion of Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion and TelOne’s fi­bre op­tic project with the chair­per­son of the China Ex­im­bank, Hu Xiao­lian. On Hwange Power Sta­tion ex­pan­sion, the Zim­babwe Power Com­pany rep­re­sented by its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor En­gi­neer Noah Gwariro and Si­no­hy­dro rep­re­sented by chair­man of its par­ent com­pany, Power China, Yan Zhiy­ong, signed a co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment on Hwange 7 and 8 project. The ex­pan­sion project at Hwange will see Si­no­hy­dro adding two units with a ca­pac­ity of 600 MW. Gao signed four more deals on avi­a­tion co­op­er­a­tion with Trans­port and In­fra­struc­ture De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Jo­ram Gumbo and con­struc­tion of a na­tional phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ware­house with Health and Child Care Min­is­ter, Dr David Parireny­atwa. He also signed a han­dover and ac­cep­tance of cer­tifi­cate on the do­na­tion of equip­ment for wildlife pro­tec­tion in Zim­babwe with En­vi­ron­ment, Wa­ter and Cli­mate Min­is­ter Op­pah Muchin­guri and an agree­ment on the ex­change of notes for the con­struc­tion of a new Par­lia­ment build­ing with Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment, Pub­lic Works and Na­tional Hous­ing Min­is­ter Saviour Ka­sukuwere. Pol­icy Co­or­di­na­tion and Pro­mo­tion of So­cio-Eco­nomic Ven­tures in the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice Min­is­ter, Si­mon Khaya Moyo, signed an agree­ment with the chair­man of the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion chair­per­son, Xu Shaoshi, on en­hance­ment of in­vest­ment. Two more pri­vate sec­tor agree­ments were also signed be­tween In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness of China and China Africa Sun­light En­ergy on the de­vel­op­ment of coal and methane gas mines as well the es­tab­lish­ment of 600 MW ther­mal power sta­tion in Gwayi. The other agree­ment was be­tween AVM Africa Lim­ited and Beijing Au­to­mo­bile As­sem­bly. Ear­lier on, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe had de­scribed China as Zim­babwe’s best friend at in­ter­na­tional level. He said the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries was not premised on the fact that China was a rich coun­try, but that the Chi­nese were peo­ple of ac­tion. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe chron­i­cled the im­por­tant role that China played dur­ing the Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle by pro­vid­ing mil­i­tary and tech­ni­cal sup­port. “We had a tough strug­gle against the Bri­tish set­tlers and the Chi­nese as­sisted us with guns,” he said. “Ev­ery year I went to China to say we need more guns and more guns were given un­til we at­tained our in­de­pen­dence on April 18, 1980. So as we host you here, this is your sec­ond coun­try be­cause China as­sisted us to at­tain our in­de­pen­dence.” Af­ter at­tain­ing po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said, Zim­babwe em­barked on an­other strug­gle to em­power peo­ple eco­nom­i­cally. He said Zim­babwe was seek­ing fi­nan­cial sup­port from the Chi­nese to con­vert the coun­try’s vast nat­u­ral re­sources into wealth. “We now have free­dom and the task at hand is to con­vert our nat­u­ral re­sources into wealth for our peo­ple,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “The main area of this strug­gle is fight­ing poverty and back­ward­ness. The other key ar­eas in­clude roads, rail and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment.” In re­sponse, Pres­i­dent Xi who was speak­ing through an in­ter­preter, said China placed high pre­mium to its re­la­tions with Zim­babwe. He said his visit, which was the only one on a bi­lat­eral level dur­ing his sec­ond visit to Africa, was in ful­fil­ment of the prom­ise that he made to Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe last year that Zim­babwe would be his first des­ti­na­tion on his sec­ond visit to Africa. “I’m ful­fill­ing that prom­ise,” said Pres­i­dent Xi to deaf­en­ing ap­plause. “I was over­whelmed by the wel­come by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe and the peo­ple of Zim­babwe at the air­port. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe is a sea­soned states­man and a found­ing fa­ther of Africa who is re­spected across the con­ti­nent. In China, we also have the same peo­ple whom we hold in high re­gard.” Pres­i­dent Xi hailed Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe for lead­ing Zim­babwe on a de­vel­op­ment path and un­com­pro­mised stance to­wards ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence. He said the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries was premised on a mu­tual and win­win ba­sis. “Last year Zim­babwe and China agreed to be good friends and broth­ers on an equal foot­ing,” he said. “The re­la­tion­ship be­tween Zim­babwe and China has stood the test of time and is one of the best re­la­tion­ships be­tween the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.” Pres­i­dent Xi said it was his hope that Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe would lead the African Union to new heights as a re­spected states­man. For­eign Af­fairs Min­is­ter Sim­barashe Mum­bengegwi and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wang Yi, said the lead­ers had a suc­cess­ful meet­ing dur­ing a closed ses­sion at State House. Min­is­ter Mum­bengegwi said Beijing was an im­por­tant friend of Harare, which ve­toed a res­o­lu­tion by some Western pow­ers that sought to im­pose dev­as­tat­ing sanc­tions on Zim­babwe un­der the United Na­tions in 2008. Wang said the visit by Pres­i­dent Xi gave im­pe­tus to the flour­ish­ing re­la­tion­ship be­tween Zim­babwe and China. He said the two lead­ers agreed to up­grade the re­la­tion­ship from trade of pri­mary com­modi­ties to in­vest­ments and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20151206,Why China is in­vest­ing in Africa,"TO an av­er­age lit­er­ate per­son in Zim­babwe this may sound like a mil­lion dol­lar ques­tion, but to some of us the rea­sons are very clear and it does not re­quire any rocket sci­en­tist to an­swer this ques­tion. The Chi­nese Pres­i­dent, Xi Jin­ping was last week in Zim­babwe and left the coun­try with a great sigh of re­lief and hope for a bright eco­nomic fu­ture, hing­ing on the fruition of the 10 ad­di­tional Gov­ern­ment to Gov­ern­ment in­vest­ment deals and two pri­vate sec­tor deals that were signed on Wed­nes­day (last week), fol­low­ing the nine deals that were signed last year when Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe vis­ited China. China and its African part­ners, Zim­babwe in­cluded, in­ter­act in a wide range of po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, and mil­i­tary-re­lated are­nas in ways that ad­vance mu­tual in­ter­ests, but eco­nomic pur­suits lie at the heart of the Sino-African re­la­tions, hence the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion un­der­way in South Africa over this week­end. China seeks to ac­quire oil, gas, min­er­als, and other nat­u­ral re­sources to fuel its phe­nom­e­nal eco­nomic growth that spans over a very few years, and has seen China ris­ing to be the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the World to­day. Many African coun­tries have plen­ti­ful re­source re­serves whose ex­trac­tion rep­re­sents their pri­mary eco­nomic out­put. Beijing also seeks mar­kets for Chi­nese com­pa­nies to sell their goods and ser­vices; con­sumers in many less-de­vel­oped coun­tries on the con­ti­nent wel­come in­ex­pen­sive Chi­nese man­u­fac­tured goods, while African gov­ern­ments pur­chase in­ex­pen­sive Chi­nese mil­i­tary ma­te­rial and hire Chi­nese con­struc­tion and engi­neer­ing com­pa­nies to de­velop the much-needed phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture. In the po­lit­i­cal arena, China seeks al­lies at the United Na­tions, and so do the African coun­tries, and in other in­ter­na­tional fora, and African gov­ern­ments are ea­ger to be courted by a global power that treats them as sov­er­eign equals in­stead of lec­tur­ing them about democ­racy, good gov­er­nance, and free mar­kets. China pro­vides ex­ten­sive de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance to demon­strate its good in­ten­tions and creates a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment to commerce and friendly po­lit­i­cal re­la­tions, while African­gener­all African­coun­tries­gen­er­ally wel­come China’s will­ing­ness to pro­vide aid with­out pre­con­di­tions, as typ­i­cally re­quired by the United States and the rest of the In­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity of donors and in­vestors. What China wants from Africa China has four over­ar­ch­ing strate­gic in­ter­ests in Africa: ac­cess to nat­u­ral re­sources, par­tic­u­larly oil and gas, mar­kets for Chi­nese ex­ports, po­lit­i­cal le­git­i­macy in in­ter­na­tional fora, par­tic­u­larly in re­gards to China’s prin­ci­ple of non-in­ter­fer­ence, “South­South sol­i­dar­ity,’’ and ad­her­ence to the “One China” pol­icy and pros­per­ity, se­cu­rity, and sta­bil­ity on the con­ti­nent, both for Africans’ well-be­ing and to en­sure safety of China’s in­vest­ments and the con­tin­u­a­tion of its com­mer­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. De­spite pub­lic re­la­tions ef­forts to por­tray the re­la­tion­ship as com­pre­hen­sive and mul­ti­fac­eted, China’s num­ber one in­ter­est in Africa re­mains se­cur­ing ac­cess to oil, min­er­als, and other raw ma­te­ri­als to fuel its am­bi­tious in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion ef­forts. Such keen in­ter­est in Africa can be seen as part of the broader “go­ing out” strat­egy that China ini­ti­ated in the late 1990s, which en­cour­ages state-owned and pri­vate com­pa­nies to in­vest abroad, par­tic­u­larly in coun­tries rich in nat­u­ral re­sources. By 2020, China is pre­dicted to over­take the United States in terms of oil im­ports world­wide and will be­come the largest global con­sumer by 2035. To guar­an­tee fu­ture sup­ply, China is heav­ily in­vest­ing in the up­stream and down­stream oil sec­tors in coun­tries such as Su­dan, An­gola, and Nige­ria. Africa also presents a huge un­tapped mar­ket for Chi­nese goods. Africa’s col­lec­tive Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct (GDP) is es­ti­mated to grow to $2,6 tril­lion by 2020. In­vest­ment in Africa can po­ten­tially fa­cil­i­tate China’s ef­forts to re­struc­ture its own econ­omy away from labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries, es­pe­cially as labour costs in China in­crease. Th­ese two fac­tors — feed­ing Chi­nese en­ergy needs and ab­sorb­ing Chi­nese ex­ports — re­main the cen­tral driv­ers of China’s en­gage­ment with Africa. What Africa Wants from China African gov­ern­ments look to China to pro­vide po­lit­i­cal recog­ni­tion and le­git­i­macy and to con­trib­ute to their eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment through aid, in­vest­ment, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, and trade. To some de­gree, many African lead­ers hope that China will in­ter­act with them in ways that the United States and other Western coun­tries do not, by en­gag­ing eco­nom­i­cally with­out con­de­scend­ingly preach­ing about good gov­er­nance, for ex­am­ple, or by in­vest­ing in high-risk projects or in re­mote re­gions that are not ap­peal­ing to Western gov­ern­ments or com­pa­nies. Some African of­fi­cials as­pire to repli­cate China’s rapid eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and be­lieve that their na­tions can ben­e­fit from China’s re­cent ex­pe­ri­ence in lifting it­self out of poverty. The vice chair­man of Tan­za­nia’s rul­ing party, for ex­am­ple, said in 2012 that, “China’s de­vel­op­ment model sets a very good ex­am­ple for African na­tions, in Tan­za­nia in par­tic­u­lar. . . It is a model which shows how a coun­try can de­velop from a low level of pro­duc­tion to very high level of pro­duc­tion and it is the cor­rect model for all de­vel­op­ing na­tions, es­pe­cially for African na­tions”. Many African lead­ers sim­ply be­lieve that as a fel­low de­vel­op­ing coun­try, China has more al­tru­is­tic mo­tives than ex­ploita­tive Western cor­po­ra­tions. The Tan­za­nian party of­fi­cial, for ex­am­ple, as­serted, “Com­pa­nies in the west are busi­ness-ori­ented, they are to make prof­its in what­ever projects they par­tic­i­pate in, they look for what they can get out of it, not what African coun­tries would get out of it. China does not have that ap­proach. China is to help the African na­tions build their own ca­pac­ity to de­velop and that’s the dif­fer­ence we must very much ap­pre­ci­ate, as Africa.” How­ever, China has been widely crit­i­cised by both po­lit­i­cal lead­ers and or­di­nary cit­i­zens in Africa for fail­ing, in re­al­ity, to live up to its prom­ises to con­trib­ute to African coun­tries’ in­dige­nous eco­nomic ca­pac­ity, a dy­namic that has led China to make a more con­certed ef­fort to gen­er­ate eco­nomic ben­e­fits for its African part­ners. On Wed­nes­day (last week) one an­a­lyst had this to say, “I think that there is this wide mis­con­cep­tion in Zim­babwe that since the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent has vis­ited, we will see an eco­nomic turn­around spurred by Chi­nese in­vest­ment. Noth­ing can be fur­ther from the truth. It is about time that Africans re­alise that Chi­nese aid is not in­tended to im­pact re­cip­i­ent state’s gov­er­nance or sovereignty in any pos­i­tive man­ner what­so­ever. It is pri­mar­ily in­tended to ben­e­fit China and China alone”. Then on Thurs­day (last week) when I was lis­ten­ing to a lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion, a top Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial sug­gested that the rea­son why there hasn’t been much of mean­ing­ful and value cre­at­ing in­vest­ment in­flows from China it’s be­cause China had no ca­pac­ity to do so, as it has been fo­cus­ing on grow­ing its own econ­omy. The irony of the whole mat­ter is that China has been grow­ing its econ­omy to­gether with other coun­tries’ economies and not Zim­babwe. My hum­ble sub­mis­sion is that peo­ple seem not to understand China very well. The Chi­nese are very se­ri­ous in­vestors, like I have al­ways said to my MBA stu­dents at So­lusi Univer­sity, there is the other side or face of China. The truth is, like the West, China also want to be sure about the se­cu­rity of their in­vest­ment, they also want to see an in­vest­ment friendly en­vi­ron­ment. Look at the na­ture of the deals they have signed with us — mainly in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment loans not grants. The se­cu­rity of th­ese in­vest­ments lies on the fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of this coun­try as well. May I con­clude by say­ing that as long as we still do not want to take a very deep in­tro­spec­tive look into our­selves, and say where ex­actly are we get­ting it wrong, all th­ese deals that China has signed with us will slip off our fin­gers. One sin­gle can­cer that we must fight and win is cor­rup­tion. China has done it, let’s learn from our all-weather friends and we will be eco­nom­i­cally suc­cess­ful. The Zim As­set will be the first eco­nomic blueprint to achieve its in­tended goal.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191021,"Rus­sia pledges more aid, co­op­er­a­tion","THE Pres­i­dent of the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion, Mr Vladimir Putin, has said his coun­try will con­tinue to pro­vide hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to African coun­tries af­fected by Cy­clone Idai, which dev­as­tated South­ern African coun­tries, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe. Pres­i­dent Putin said this in an in­ter­view with Rus­sian News Agency (TASS), ahead of the in­au­gu­ral Rus­sia-Africa Sum­mit this week. He also spoke on a range of co­op­er­a­tion is­sues, which puts Rus­sia firmly in the geopo­lit­i­cal ma­trix of forg­ing strong re­la­tions with the con­ti­nent. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is to­day ex­pected to lead a Zim­bab­wean del­e­ga­tion to the sum­mit, which will take place on Wed­nes­day and Thurs­day in Sochi and the fo­rum will fo­cus on key ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Rus­sia and African coun­tries. The dis­cus­sions are framed by three the­matic pil­lars — “Forg­ing Eco­nomic Ties”, “Cre­at­ing Joint Projects”, and “Col­lab­o­rat­ing in the Hu­man­i­tar­ian and So­cial Sec­tor”. Pres­i­dent Putin said his coun­try, which helped Cy­clone Idai vic­tims this year, would con­tinue to give hu­man­i­tar­ian sup­port to Zim­babwe and other af­fected coun­tries. And he paid at­ten­tion to the hu­man­i­tar­ian di­men­sion. “Hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance is be­ing pro­vided to Africa by many world coun­tries, yet none of them — be it the US, France, China or any other coun­try — has fully re­solved all of its so­cial prob­lems, in­clud­ing in health­care, ed­u­ca­tion and cul­ture. “Rus­sia too pro­vides hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to African states, but not by re­duc­ing the amount of fund­ing for its own pro­grammes. Af­ter all, good tra­di­tions of char­ity and sup­port in times of need are a hall­mark of our peo­ple,” Pres­i­dent Putin said. “Rus­sia, as many other states, pro­vided aid to the African coun­tries af­fected by trop­i­cal Cy­clone Idai in April 2019. Rus­sia sent hu­man­i­tar­ian sup­plies to Zim­babwe, Malawi and Mozam­bique, that is large tents, blan­kets and food prod­ucts weigh­ing about 30 tonnes for each coun­try. “We con­tinue to take an ac­tive part in ef­forts to pro­vide com­pre­hen­sive as­sis­tance to Africa. Rus­sia is in­volved in the UN World Food Pro­gramme’s school meals project val­ued at US$40 mil­lion, which has been im­ple­mented in Mozam­bique since Oc­to­ber 2017, and in the project to in­tro­duce modern tech­nol­ogy and equip­ment for dis­in­fec­tion worth up to US$15 mil­lion in Mada­gas­car.” Pres­i­dent Putin said Rus­sia was among the first coun­tries to re­act to the Ebola out­break as well as other pan­demics. “We also pro­vide as­sis­tance to our African friends in health­care de­vel­op­ment, as dan­ger­ous com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases re­spect no bor­ders. Rus­sia was among the first to re­act to Ebola haem­or­rhagic fever out­break, hav­ing al­lo­cated US$60 mil­lion to com­bat it. There is now a mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy and epi­demi­ol­ogy re­search cen­tre in Guinea. Rus­sia con­trib­uted US$20 mil­lion to the World Bank pro­gramme to im­ple­ment the global malaria con­trol ini­tia­tive.’’ Pres­i­dent Putin said. “And such ex­am­ples are plenty. I would like to em­pha­sise that Rus­sia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in fight­ing poverty, dan­ger­ous ill­nesses and other global threats, as well as re­duc­tion of po­ten­tial risks ‘at dis­tant ap­proaches’ are fully in line with our na­tional in­ter­ests.” This week’s sum­mit is ex­pected to deepen friendly re­la­tions be­tween the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion and the African con­ti­nent on both bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral lev­els, forge closer col­lab­o­ra­tion on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional is­sues of com­mon in­ter­est, raise strate­gic di­a­logue be­tween Rus­sia and African coun­tries to a qual­i­ta­tively higher level, and con­trib­ute to peace, se­cu­rity and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment on the African con­ti­nent. The Rus­sia-Africa Sum­mit will also con­trib­ute to­wards the over­all ob­jec­tive of ad­dress­ing the as­pi­ra­tions of African coun­tries as en­cap­su­lated in Agenda 2063. Agenda 2063 calls for a peo­ple-cen­tered de­vel­op­men­tal process that en­sures, in­ter alia, eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and growth in or­der to erad­i­cate poverty, un­em­ploy­ment and in­equal­ity. The par­tic­i­pa­tion of Zim­babwe at this in­au­gu­ral sum­mit is in line with the coun­try’s re-en­gage­ment pol­icy pil­lar of co­op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous tech­ni­cal fields, as well as pro­mot­ing eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the Zim­babwe and the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion are at op­ti­mal level and con­tinue to grow from strength to strength.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150529,Il­licit fi­nan­cial flow,"OVER the last 50 years, Africa is es­ti­mated to have lost in ex­cess of US$1 tril­lion in il­licit fi­nan­cial flows (IFFs) (Kar and Cartwright-Smith 2010; Kar and Leblanc 2013). This sum is roughly equiv­a­lent to all of the of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance re­ceived by Africa dur­ing the same time­frame. Cur­rently, Africa is es­ti­mated to be los­ing more than US$50 bil­lion an­nu­ally in IFFs. But these es­ti­mates may well fall short of re­al­ity be­cause ac­cu­rate data do not ex­ist for all African coun­tries, and these es­ti­mates of­ten ex­clude some forms of IFFs that by na­ture are se­cret and can­not be prop­erly es­ti­mated, such as pro­ceeds of bribery and traf­fick­ing of drugs, peo­ple and firearms. The amount lost an­nu­ally by Africa through IFFs is there­fore likely to ex­ceed US$50 bil­lion by a sig­nif­i­cant amount. These out­flows are of se­ri­ous con­cern, given in­ad­e­quate growth, high lev­els of poverty, re­source needs and the chang­ing global land­scape of of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance. Although African economies have been grow­ing at an av­er­age of about 5% a year since the turn of the cen­tury, this rate is con­sid­ered en­cour­ag­ing but in­ad­e­quate. It is, for ex­am­ple, be­low the dou­ble-digit growth that has pro­pelled trans­for­ma­tion in parts of Asia. Fur­ther, the ben­e­fits of this growth have mostly been con­fined to those at the top of the in­come dis­tri­bu­tion and it has not been ac­com­pa­nied by an in­crease in jobs. Aside from the eq­uity is­sues that this raises, it also means that this growth may not be sus­tain­able due to pos­si­ble so­cial un­rest. The global com­mod­ity su­per-cy­cle that has con­trib­uted to Africa’s growth is com­ing to an end, while macroe­co­nomic fac­tors such as debt re­duc­tion might be a once-off ef­fect. Poverty re­mains of se­ri­ous con­cern in Africa in ab­so­lute and rel­a­tive terms. The num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing on less than US$1,25 a day in Africa is es­ti­mated to have in­creased from 290 mil­lion in 1990 to 414 mil­lion in 2010 (United Na­tions, 2013). This is be­cause pop­u­la­tion growth out­weighs the num­ber of peo­ple ris­ing out of poverty. More­over, GDP per African was around US$2 000 in 2013, which is around one-fifth of the level world­wide (IMF, 2014). Poverty in Africa is also mul­ti­di­men­sional, in the sense of lim­ited ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, hous­ing, potable wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion. This sit­u­a­tion puts the loss of more than US$50 bil­lion a year in IFFs in bet­ter per­spec­tive. The re­source needs of African coun­tries for so­cial ser­vices, in­fra­struc­ture and in­vest­ment also un­der­score the im­por­tance of stem­ming IFFs from the con­ti­nent. At cur­rent pop­u­la­tion trends, Africa is set to have the largest youth pop­u­la­tion in the world. By 2050 the me­dian age for Africa will be 25 years, while the av­er­age for the world as whole will be about 36 years (United Na­tions Pop­u­la­tion Di­vi­sion, 2012). In­fra­struc­ture con­straints also act as a brake on growth, just as do the low sav­ings and in­vest­ment rates of the con­ti­nent. In 2012 gross cap­i­tal for­ma­tion rates in Nige­ria and South Africa were 13% and 19%, re­spec­tively, as com­pared to a rate of 49% in China and 35% in In­dia (United Na­tions Sta­tis­tics Di­vi­sion, 2014; World Bank, 2014). Yet Africa is es­ti­mated to need an ad­di­tional US$30–US$50 bil­lion an­nu­ally to fund in­fra­struc­ture projects (Fos­ter and BriceñoGar­men­dia, 2010; African De­vel­op­ment Bank, 2014). The Panel con­sid­ered that when these needs are cou­pled with the chang­ing land­scape of of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance, Africa can­not af­ford to re­main san­guine about the prob­lem posed by IFFs. Cur­rent de­vel­op­ments in the global arena in fact make the chal­lenge posed by IFFs more acute. The re­sources that Africa re­ceives from ex­ter­nal part­ners in the form of of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance are stag­nat­ing due to the do­mes­tic fis­cal chal­lenges of part­ners, who in re­sponse are seek­ing to re­duce such ex­pen­di­tures. Africa will there­fore need to look within the con­ti­nent to fund its de­vel­op­ment agenda and re­duce reliance on of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance. IFFs are also of con­cern be­cause of their im­pact on gov­er­nance. Suc­cess­fully tak­ing out these re­sources usu­ally in­volves sub­orn­ing of state of­fi­cials and can con­trib­ute to un­der­min­ing state struc­tures, since con­cerned ac­tors may have the re­sources to pre­vent the proper func­tion­ing of reg­u­la­tory in­sti­tu­tions. — High Level Panel on Il­licit Fi­nan­cial Flows from Africa report.",津巴布韦

This emerged dur­ing a re­cent all stake­hold­ers meet­ing or­gan­ised by the En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment Agency in Bin­dura, where stake­hold­ers called for an ur­gent ad­dress of the sit­u­a­tion as the prov­ince re­lies on fire ten­ders from Harare in the event of a fire out­break. Act­ing Mashona­land Cen­tral provin­cial devel­op­ment co­or­di­na­tor Mr Cos­mas Chiringa said the Provin­cial Civil Pro­tec­tion Com­mit­tee (PCPC) had brought the is­sue to the at­ten­tion of the na­tional of­fice. “It is wor­ri­some to note that the whole prov­ince does not have a sin­gle func­tional fire ten­der, leav­ing it vul­ner­a­ble. When a fire breaks out, we have to sum­mon fire ten­ders from Harare to at­tend to the in­ci­dent. Our provin­cial cap­i­tal, Bin­dura does not have one and this also ap­plies to all the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties in this prov­ince. “We have been call­ing on them to have fire ten­ders in place, but they all cite fi­nan­cial chal­lenges and this is un­ac­cept­able be­cause one day disas­ter will strike and we will be found want­ing. With veld fires wreak­ing havoc across the coun­try, one day we will lose lives and prop­erty if the sit­u­a­tion is not ur­gently ad­dressed,” he said. A lec­turer at Bin­dura Univer­sity of Sci­ence Ed­u­ca­tion’s En­vi­ron­men­tal Sci­ence Depart­ment, Pro­fes­sor Ge­orge Nya­madzawo, said hu­man lives and prop­erty have been lost in the past be­cause of lack of fire ten­ders in the prov­ince. “We have been car­ry­ing out a re­search in the causes of veld fires in the prov­ince and we were shocked to dis­cover that the whole prov­ince does not have a sin­gle fire ten­der de­spite it be­ing ranked high among prov­inces where veld fires oc­cur ev­ery year. “The prov­ince is grap­pling with chal­lenges of lack of proper firefighting equip­ment and does not have trained per­son­nel to deal with fire out­breaks. In some cases firefighting com­mit­tees are in place, but they are not re­sourced to fight any out­breaks.” He added: “As a prov­ince, we need to im­prove our ca­pac­ity in firefighting tech­niques. Each district should have at least a sin­gle fire ten­der in place since we are a farm­ing prov­ince where cases of veld fires are ram­pant es­pe­cially in re­set­tled ar­eas. “We dis­cov­ered that most peo­ple in re­set­tle­ment ar­eas are not putting up fire­guards around their farms.” Prof Nya­madzawo called for the avail­ing of more re­sources for the es­tab­lish­ment of fire dan­ger rat­ing signs in all dis­tricts. “We were in­volved in the set­ting up of fire dan­ger rat­ing sings across the coun­try, but the project was stalled be­cause of lack of re­sources. Some of the signs were ei­ther de­stroyed by fires or van­dalised. Each district should have at least 10 of these fire dan­ger rat­ing signs,” he said.

China In­ter­na­tional has ap­proached the High Court seek­ing to re­verse the court’s judg­ment set­ting aside an ar­bi­tral award, which was in its favour. The two com­pa­nies en­tered into an agree­ment of US$1 205 869, 93 for the sur­fac­ing of the Tugwi-Mukosi road on April 28, 2018. “Af­ter ex­piry of the con­tract, Bi­tu­men En­gi­neer­ing in­sti­tuted ar­bi­tra­tion pro­ceed­ings against China In­ter­na­tional on the grounds that it had breached their agree­ment and claimed $788 905, 43,” read the court pa­pers. “Bi­tu­men was un­suc­cess­ful, and on April 9, 2019, an ar­bi­tra­tor Peter Mor­ris is­sued an ar­bi­tral award in favour of China In­ter­na­tional award­ing it $63, 273, 86 in com­pen­sa­tion for ad­di­tional costs it in­curred due to a breach of con­tract by Bi­tu­men En­gi­neer­ing.” Ac­cord­ing to the ar­bi­tral award, par­ties were to agree on whether the $63 273, 86 was to be set­tled in the form of stone or in money.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20180617,Call to im­prove con­di­tions of bees,"THE Zim­babwe Api­cul­ture Plat­form (ZAP) says there is a need to im­prove the con­di­tions of bees and other pol­li­na­tors as they play an in­te­gral part in im­prov­ing peo­ple’s liveli­hoods. Ad­dress­ing a gath­er­ing at the be­lated coun­try’s first World Bee Day com­mem­o­ra­tion, which was or­gan­ised by Mata­bele­land Bee­keep­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (MBA) two weeks ago, ZAP chair­per­son Ms Jac­quie Gowe said bees and other pol­li­na­tors play a big part in en­sur­ing the health, nu­tri­tion and food se­cu­rity of peo­ple thus the need to pre­serve them. “The main pur­pose of this event is to spread aware­ness of the sig­nif­i­cance of bees and other pol­li­na­tors for our sur­vival. We must re­alise that sim­ply pro­claim­ing World Bee Day does not do much for bees and other pol­li­na­tors; the main work aim­ing to­wards their preser­va­tion still needs to be un­der­taken and World Bee Day is an ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­nity in this re­gard. “We would like to ask every­body to help im­prove the con­di­tions for bees, thus im­prov­ing con­di­tions for the sur­vival of peo­ple. No ma­jor steps are needed; what counts is each and ev­ery ac­tion that fa­cil­i­tates the ex­is­tence of bees. I be­lieve that af­ter this suc­cess­ful event, the world will now be­gin to think more broadly about bees, in par­tic­u­lar in the con­text of en­sur­ing con­di­tions for their sur­vival, and thus for the sur­vival of the hu­man race,” she said. e com­mem­o­ra­tion comes af­ter the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, on 20 De­cem­ber 2017 adopted by con­sen­sus a res­o­lu­tion declar­ing 20 May as World Bee Day.

ZAP and MBA sec­re­tary Mr Wel­come Bhila also un­der­scored the im­por­tance of bees to hu­man be­ing’s sur­vival. “Bees play a cru­cial role in pro­mot­ing food se­cu­rity and nu­tri­tion. With­out them, we can­not achieve a world with­out hunger. Bees also sig­nif­i­cantly con­trib­ute to the mit­i­ga­tion of cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal con­ser­va­tion. In the longterm, the pro­tec­tion of bees and the bee­keep­ing sec­tor can help re­duce poverty and hunger, as well as pre­serve a healthy en­vi­ron­ment and bio­di­ver­sity. Al­ready, sci­en­tific stud­ies have proven that bees have be­come in­creas­ingly en­dan­gered. Thus, it is only through joint ef­forts that we can en­sure the pro­tec­tion of bees and their habi­tats. The procla­ma­tion of World Bee Day proves that the will­ing­ness to take ac­tion does ex­ist,” he said. Mr Bhila urged the cor­po­rate world to chip in with fund­ing in sup­port of the bee­keep­ing in­dus­try as it plays a ma­jor role in com­ple­ment­ing Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to erad­i­cate hunger and poverty. “I be­lieve we all agree that ev­ery hu­man be­ing on this planet de­serves food ev­ery day. We have to pro­duce more food ev­ery day, and ev­ery day more food is de­pen­dent on pol­li­na­tors — with honey bees in the lead. To talk about re­duc­ing global hunger with­out en­sur­ing con­di­tions for the sur­vival of bees and other pol­li­na­tors, is sim­ply throw­ing sand in peo­ple’s eyes. It is time for ev­ery­one to lis­ten to bees, in par­tic­u­lar cor­po­rates, lead­ers and those who make de­ci­sions” he said. Mr Bhila is also the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Bee’s Honey Com­pany, a lo­cal honey pro­ducer that was re­cently granted an ex­port per­mit to pro­duce for the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket.",津巴布韦

Since 2000, we have had the is­sues of sanc­tions and the debt over­hang mil­i­tat­ing against us. Our strat­egy now for re-en­gage­ment is to go around the sanc­tions and the debt is­sue. “So, this means that we have to do our re-en­gage­ment at a po­lit­i­cal and at an eco­nomic level. As a coun­try, we should be able to be a friend of ev­ery­one and an enemy of no­body.” He added: “. . .The strat­egy is to ramp up pro­duc­tion to make up for rev­enue by in­creas­ing vol­umes.

Gov­ern­ment has in­creased ir­ri­ga­tion projects via Brazil's More Food Pro­gramme, with sim­i­lar ini­tia­tives ex­pected to in­volve China, Be­larus, the UAE and other coun­tries.

The an­nounce­ment, an ap­par­ent at­tempt to tem­per ex­pec­ta­tions that China’s slow­ing econ­omy will re­bound to any­thing near the dou­ble-digit growth of re­cent decades, came as the party re­leased the broad out­lines of pro­pos­als for its next five-year plan. That blueprint of its eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment was dis­cussed at a re­cent party ple­nary ses­sion in Bei­jing and is ex­pected to be com­pleted next spring by the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress, a leg­is­la­ture that grants pro­forma ap­proval to party pol­icy. In declar­ing the tar­get of 6,5 per­cent, Mr Xi was re­it­er­at­ing a fig­ure that Prime Min­is­ter Li Ke­qiang had used in a speech on Sun­day in South Korea. The lead­ers say the tar­get must be met for China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and per capita in­come in 2020 to be dou­ble what they were in 2010. “China aims to nar­row the in­come gap and raise the pro­por­tion of the mid­dle-class in­come pop­u­la­tion in the next five years,” ac­cord­ing to a re­port by Xin­hua, the state news agency, on the pro­pos­als for the next five-year plan, which will be the 13th in the party’s his­tory. China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per capita is about $7,800, the Xin­hua re­port said, cit­ing fig­ures re­leased on Tues­day. With nearly 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple, China is the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try. The cur­rent de­vel­op­ment plan, which runs from 2011 to the end of this year, set an an­nual growth tar­get of about 7 per­cent. The party said the pro­pos­als for the new plan aimed to, among other things, erad­i­cate ru­ral poverty (an “ar­du­ous task”); pro­mote in­clu­sion of the Chi­nese cur­rency, the ren­minbi, in the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund’s bas­ket of cur­ren­cies; and at­tract for­eign in­vest­ment while en­cour­ag­ing more Chi­nese busi­nesses to in­vest over­seas. The party also said that China would set up a “Green De­vel­op­ment Fund” to pro­mote clean industry and sus­tain­able growth. The pro­pos­als em­pha­sised the need to strengthen con­ser­va­tive party ide­ol­ogy in pub­lic realms, an im­por­tant goal un­der Mr Xi. For ex­am­ple, they called for cul­ti­vat­ing a pos­i­tive cul­ture on the In­ter­net and cleans­ing the on­line en­vi­ron­ment. At the same time, the plan said China wanted to im­prove In­ter­net speeds — a task seem­ingly in­com­pat­i­ble, at least on a global level, with the coun­try’s Great Fire­wall sys­tem of web cen­sor­ship. The pro­pos­als were ap­proved af­ter about 200 full mem­bers of the party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee held a meet­ing for four days last month in a heav­ily guarded ho­tel in western Bei­jing. Last Thurs­day, dur­ing the ses­sion, the party an­nounced that it was chang­ing its one-child pol­icy of fam­ily plan­ning to a two-child pol­icy in an at­tempt to stim­u­late eco­nomic growth. The new pol­icy is also ex­pected to be ap­proved by the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress next spring and will go into ef­fect af­ter­ward, al­though econ­o­mists and de­mog­ra­phers say they do not ex­pect a big spike in the na­tional birthrate. On Tues­day, some crit­ics ex­pressed scep­ti­cism about whether any five-year plan could ad­dress the evolv­ing com­plex­ity of China. “Rarely do peo­ple com­pare the plan and the even­tual re­al­ity,” said Mao Yushi, chair­man of the Unir­ule In­sti­tute of Eco­nom­ics in Bei­jing. “Not one five-year plan has un­folded as planned. Why? Be­cause you can’t pre­dict the prob­lems five years from now.” The Chi­nese econ­omy grew 6,9 per­cent in the third quar­ter, rel­a­tive to a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased in Oc­to­ber. That fig­ure, while ro­bust com­pared with those of ad­vanced economies, was the slow­est for China since the global financial cri­sis of 2009, and some econ­o­mists say the econ­omy is ac­tu­ally much weaker. Mr Xi and Mr Li have said they want to shift China away from heavy industry and high in­vest­ment to­ward a larger ser­vice sec­tor and more con­sumer spend­ing. But re­cent eco­nomic shak­i­ness has fed doubts about whether they can smoothly man­age that tran­si­tion. The an­nual ple­nary ses­sions of the Cen­tral Com­mit­tee are part of the rit­u­alised cy­cle of Chi­nese pol­i­tics, giv­ing top lead­ers a plat­form to win elite en­dorse­ment for their poli­cies and to set­tle dis­agree­ments. Most fa­mously, a plenum in late 1978 sealed Deng Xiaoping’s re-emer­gence as a dom­i­nant leader and opened the way to mar­ket over­hauls that trans­formed the econ­omy over the next decade. Be­fore the lat­est meet­ing, party pro­pa­ganda de­picted Mr Xi, who is also the gen­eral sec­re­tary of the party, as a vi­sion­ary in the mold of Deng. “It is con­sis­tent with the broader trend of the C.C.P. Gen­eral sec­re­tary act­ing as the ‘chair­man of every­thing’ and en­sur­ing his per­sonal stamp is on ev­ery pol­icy,” said Scott Kennedy, a re­searcher on Chi­nese eco­nomic pol­icy at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton who has fol­lowed the draft­ing of the new five-year plan. Al­though China has shed many of the top-down eco­nomic con­trols of the Maoist era, the fiveyear plan still plays an im­por­tant role in set­ting long-term goals, Mr Kennedy said. Af­ter the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress en­dorses the plan next spring, min­istries and agen­cies will is­sue more de­tailed strate­gies for mak­ing changes re­gard­ing en­ergy, the en­vi­ron­ment, trade and other ar­eas. “The plan serves as the most au­thor­i­ta­tive state­ment on the state’s pri­or­i­ties,” Mr Kennedy said. “The party, gov­ern­ment agen­cies, financial in­sti­tu­tions and com­pa­nies then spend a great deal of ef­fort align­ing them­selves with th­ese pri­or­i­ties.” — AP",津巴布韦

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150109,A work plan for gov­ern­ment in 2015,"IN 1979, the new lead­er­ship of China who had just taken over from Mao Tse-tung after 26 years of gov­ern­ment by the men and women who par­tic­i­pated in the March to Free­dom in the late 40’s, un­der­stood that they had to change di­rec­tion if they were to suc­ceed where the “Vet­er­ans of the Long March” had failed. With the death of Mao, they had a blank sheet of pa­per on which to write a pre­scrip­tion for the fu­ture. China was to­tally iso­lated diplo­mat­i­cally, desperately poor with tens of mil­lions close to star­va­tion and was an eco­nomic back­wa­ter with a crum­bling in­fra­struc­ture and old un­com­pet­i­tive, even prim­i­tive in­dus­try. Thirty five years later, we can hardly recog­nise China. It has be­come the man­u­fac­tur­ing hub of the world, the sec­ond largest econ­omy, lifted 70% of its pop­u­la­tion out of poverty, trans­formed the lives of over one bil­lion peo­ple, and cre­ated a vast net­work of world class univer­si­ties. In ad­di­tion, it has be­come a re­spected mem­ber of the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, a key player in the United Na­tions, is the lead­ing state in Asia and has good work­ing re­la­tions with all the ma­jor Western Na­tions. That’s quite an ac­com­plish­ment, breathtaking in all re­spects. China did not re­ceive any for­eign aid, there was no “Mar­shal Plan”, no Amer­i­can hand in its re­con­struc­tion, as was the case in Ger­many and Ja­pan after the Sec­ond World War. China has few nat­u­ral re­sources, is half desert and had to rely on its own in­ge­nu­ity and the hard work of its peo­ple to achieve what they have been able to do in the past 35 years. Zim­babwe be­came in­de­pen­dent just a year after China be­gan its “long walk to de­vel­op­ment”. It had good re­la­tions with the global com­mu­nity, re­ceived bil­lions of dol­lars in aid in the next decade and was en­dowed with a di­ver­si­fied econ­omy, good in­fra­struc­ture and a school sys­tem that had pro­duced some of the best in­tel­lects in Africa. It had no deserts, an abun­dance of nat­u­ral re­sources and the sec­ond high­est in­come per capita in Africa. By 2008 Zim­babwe was in all re­spects a “failed State”, mil­lions in ab­ject poverty and de­pen­dent on food aid, the econ­omy in sham­bles with the third low­est in­come per capita in the world, a third of its pop­u­la­tion dis­placed to other coun­tries and the low­est life ex­pectancy in the world. Diplo­mat­i­cally we were a pariah State un­der eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sanc­tions. Then came the Gov­ern­ment of Na­tional Unity (GNU) and sud­denly things were “bet­ter” — the econ­omy re­cov­ered. Rev­enues to the state rose rapidly and all macroe­co­nomic in­di­ca­tors were pos­i­tive. Our re­la­tions with the IMF and the World Bank that had been dis­rupted by our fail­ure to meet our obli­ga­tions to them in the pe­riod after 1997, were sud­denly be­ing re­stored. The re­cov­ery and re­sump­tion of growth and hope came to an end when the GNU failed to de­liver the re­forms needed for a free and fair elec­tion and once again Zim­babwe was back in cri­sis. It is my view that con­trary to what the IMF and the Min­istry of Fi­nance are say­ing, that far from grow­ing by 2 or 3% in 2014, the Zim­babwe econ­omy con­tracted by 10 to 14% — equal to the de­cline in GDP in 2008, at the height of the pre­vi­ous col­lapse. Be­tween July and Au­gust 2013 there was only one change in our na­tional sit­u­a­tion — the po­lit­i­cal party known as Zanu PF re­sumed full con­trol of the state. So what did they do to bring about the sud­den col­lapse in the econ­omy? Not a great deal, in fact and that is the real prob­lem. They did not change any­thing; they took over and went back to business as usual. When Deng Xiaop­ing took over in 1979 in China he used two sim­ple il­lus­tra­tions to de­scribe how he in­tended to gov­ern. First he said that when it came to ide­ol­ogy, he would not judge a cat by its colour, but by whether or not it caught mice. Does it work, does it de­liver? If not we cast it aside and try some­thing else. The sec­ond prin­ci­ple was equally sim­ple, he said that if you are cross­ing a river and can­not see the bot­tom – feel your way across with your toes. In other words, be prag­matic, ad­just your strate­gies to meet the ob­sta­cles and prob­lems you en­counter in your ef­forts to achieve your goals. The re­sult is a highly de­volved state with real power and re­spon­si­bil­ity de­volved away from the cap­i­tal to the prov­inces and ci­ties. The bank­ing sys­tem is in­te­grated with the world econ­omy and able to meet the needs of the rapidly ex­pand­ing pri­vate sec­tor. Self ad­min­is­ter­ing schools and ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions, com­pete for stu­dents and re­sources and have pro­duced the hu­man re­sources that have driven the eco­nomic revo­lu­tion. Most of all, it has been a so­cial, eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem that has trans­formed China in just 35 years. What would Deng ad­vise our lead­er­ship to­day? The first thing he would say is that you can­not go on do­ing what you have been do­ing all th­ese years — it’s sim­ply not work­ing. So what should our lead­er­ship be do­ing? We need a work plan for 2015, one that will put this coun­try back on its feet and on a path to pros­per­ity. The first thing to recog­nise is that the old team that has led us for 35 years has failed, to­tally. They sim­ply can­not be al­lowed to con­tinue in power. We need a cab­i­net that will be able to meet the needs of the coun­try, re­store con­fi­dence in the business com­mu­nity and reen­gage with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity as a whole. We need a new na­tional cab­i­net that will bring into the ex­ec­u­tive our best brains and in­no­va­tors. Se­condly, we need to recog­nise that our po­lit­i­cal iso­la­tion is in fact our cen­tral prob­lem. We need to re­store our re­la­tions with the rest of the world – a full blown Cab­i­net reshuf­fle will go some way to­wards do­ing that, but it’s not just a ques­tion of chang­ing the Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs, although that is es­sen­tial in my view. We need to sit down and agree on a pro­gramme of po­lit­i­cal re­form that will re­store our sta­tus as a demo­cratic state which re­spects the rule of law, hu­man and po­lit­i­cal rights and the need for good gov­er­nance. In essence, re­sume the tran­si­tional process started un­der the GNU and get the coun­try ready for a truly free and fair elec­tion in 2018. Thirdly, we need to put our eco­nomic house in or­der. Our banks are in sham­bles; our global bank­ing re­la­tions are nonex­is­tent. FDI in­flows are tiny and dwarfed by the flight of cap­i­tal that is go­ing on all the time. Please do not try and tell us that the land re­form process just needs more time – it’s a mon­u­men­tal fail­ure and any­one can see that. Speak to any business leader and they will tell you, with­out ex­cep­tion, that our in­di­geni­sa­tion pro­gramme is sim­ply not ac­cept­able in its present form. Ask any prospec­tive for­eign in­vestor and they will say that after in­di­geni­sa­tion the next ma­jor is­sue is se­cu­rity. With­out se­cu­rity in all its dif­fer­ent forms, for­eign cap­i­tal is go­ing to stay away and un­til you can en­gage the global mar­ket for ac­cess to re­sources, this ship of State is go­ing nowhere.

Sun­day News un­der­stands China Wa­ter In­ter­na­tional Elec­tric Co-op­er­a­tion, which was con­tracted to carry out the pro­ject has al­ready re­cruited lo­cals from Ntepe, Vela and Nta­lale ar­eas in Gwanda District. The lo­cals said they were elated by the lat­est de­vel­op­ment and hailed the Govern­ment for cham­pi­oning de­vel­op­ment in the area as well as recog­nis­ing the need to em­power youths by of­fer­ing them em­ploy­ment. Last year when Vice-Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga vis­ited the area, he re­vealed how the con­struc­tion of the dam will go a long way in im­prov­ing ac­cess of clean wa­ter, im­prov­ing ir­ri­ga­tion fa­cil­i­ties in the prov­ince, sup­ply­ing wa­ter to neigh­bour­ing Botswana and also open­ing up of job op­por­tu­ni­ties. In a visit to the site by this news crew last week, con­trac­tors were fin­ish­ing up the clear­ing of the site that is now fully elec­tri­fied. They said the pro­ject is set to go full swing this month. Peo­ple from the area said con­trac­tors have been go­ing around home­steads of­fer­ing jobs to the lo­cals. “The Chi­nese con­trac­tors and peo­ple from Zinwa have been go­ing around the com­mu­ni­ties telling the lo­cals to come on site and ap­ply for jobs. “The jobs of­fered were for the con­struc­tion of gen­er­a­tor rooms, quarry crusher plat­forms and hous­ing struc­tures,” said Mr Nor­man Ng­wenya from Vela area. Con­struc­tion of the state-of-the-art houses that work­ers would use have also been com­pleted. Ntepe lo­cal busi­ness­woman, Ms Re­filoe Dube praised the Govern­ment for en­sur­ing the pro­ject kicks off. “The pre-con­struc­tion of the dam has el­e­vated the sta­tus quo of the com­mu­ni­ties around and with a dam con­structed for years, we hope the pro­ject will to­tally erad­i­cate poverty in the area,” she said. Spear­headed by Zinwa, the dam pro­ject which is be­ing im­ple­mented will also ser­vice the Vela, Guyu Busi­ness Cen­tre, Nta­lale Busi­ness Cen­tre, Che­lesa Busi­ness Cen­tre, Sizhubane Bar­racks, Manama Mis­sion and Busi­ness Cen­tre, Se­basa, Mankonkoni ir­ri­ga­tion schemes, among oth­ers.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200524,The ‘Africa we want’,"AS we cel­e­brate Africa Day to­mor­row, let it be a cel­e­bra­tion of our her­itage, diver­sity, sol­i­dar­ity, unity and de­vel­op­ment. Let us be re­minded to work tire­lessly to build the “Africa we want”, lever­ag­ing on our enor­mous nat­u­ral re­sources and hu­man ca­pa­bil­i­ties for the ben­e­fit of cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. Africa Day cel­e­bra­tions are sub­dued this year due to fear and panic caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic. As we bat­tle the disease, we should re­mem­ber to lift our eyes and see be­yond this pan­demic. Nel­son Man­dela once said: “I learned that courage was not the ab­sence of fear but the tri­umph over it.” The “Africa we want” can­not be cre­ated if we re­main stuck in fear and de­spon­dency. AU Agenda 2063 The African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 themed “The Africa we want” is an­chored on seven as­pi­ra­tions: a pros­per­ous Africa based on in­clu­sive growth and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment; an in­te­grated con­ti­nent based on ideals of Pan-African­ism and African Re­nais­sance; an Africa of good gov­er­nance; democ­racy and re­spect for hu­man rights and rule of law; a peace­ful and se­cure Africa; an Africa with strong cul­tural iden­tity and com­mon her­itage and val­ues; an Africa whose de­vel­op­ment is in­clu­sive and peo­ple-driven and un­leash­ing po­ten­tial of its women and youths; and a strong, united, re­silient and in­flu­en­tial global player and part­ner. But this Africa can­not be cre­ated if we do not change our mind­set. We need to start believ­ing in our­selves and our ca­pa­bil­i­ties. For if we do not trust our­selves, why should other peo­ple be­lieve in us? Sin­gle African story We need to re­gain lost ground, re­claim the space that oth­ers have used and shat­ter the stereo­types. Neg­a­tive per­cep­tions of Africa, por­trayed in the so-called “sin­gle African story”, that cre­ate the im­pres­sion that Africa is one coun­try, have tended to over­shadow great things com­ing out of Africa. These per­cep­tions have be­come the ba­sis for racist at­ti­tudes dis­played to­wards Africans to this day. With­out a counter re­sponse from African jour­nal­ists, schol­ars, writ­ers, politi­cians, and oth­ers, these nar­ra­tives about Africa will re­main un­chal­lenged, and many Africans will be­gin to be­lieve them. Take these words by Nige­rian writer Chi­ma­manda Ngozi Adichie, for in­stance: “If I had not grown up in Nige­ria, and if all I knew about Africa were pop­u­lar im­ages, I too would think that Africa was a place of beau­ti­ful land­scapes, beau­ti­ful an­i­mals, and in­com­pre­hen­si­ble peo­ple, fight­ing sense­less wars, dy­ing of poverty and Aids, un­able to speak for them­selves and wait­ing to be saved by a kind, white for­eigner.” This sin­gle African nar­ra­tive has not been au­thored by Africans it has been writ­ten by peo­ple who en­slaved Africans, colonised Africa, looted African re­sources and im­pov­er­ished African peo­ple. As Pro­fes­sor Pa­trice Lu­mumba puts it: “The day will come when his­tory will speak. Africa will write its own his­tory, it will be a his­tory of glory and dig­nity.” Sadly, that day may never come un­less we take bold steps to rise up and tell our own sto­ries, that re­flect our rich and di­verse lan­guages and cul­tures from 54 coun­tries that make up Africa. Ed­u­ca­tion Colo­nial­ism may have gone, but the ves­tiges of colo­nial men­tal­ity and ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems are still around. Learn­ers are taught us­ing ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems rooted in colo­nial ed­u­ca­tion syl­labi, an off­shoot from Western cul­tures that seek to oblit­er­ate African civil­i­sa­tion and its rich cul­tural her­itage. Re­li­gion has also played its part in this sys­temic era­sure of African civil­i­sa­tion and cul­tural her­itage. African au­thor, scholar and philoso­pher, Pro­fes­sor Man­di­vamba Rukuni, in his book “Be­ing Afrikan”, high­lights that ero­sion of African civil­i­sa­tion came about with for­eign ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems and re­li­gions im­posed on Africans through colo­nial­ism. This marked the birth of peren­nial con­flicts be­tween African cul­tures on one hand and for­eign ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems and re­li­gions on the other. This cre­ated con­fu­sion among Africans where any­thing to do with African culture was seen as back­ward. We need to make our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems rel­e­vant to Africa and fit for our own pur­poses. Ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems across our di­verse con­ti­nent should re­flect our great African her­itage, in­spired by our val­ues. Re­sources Africa’s un­der­de­vel­op­ment is not due to scarcity of hu­man ca­pa­bil­i­ties and nat­u­ral re­sources. Sta­tis­tics by the AU show that Africa holds a sig­nif­i­cant amount of the world’s re­sources (12 per­cent oil, 42 per­cent gold, 80 to 90 per­cent chromium and plat­inum group met­als, and 60 per­cent arable land). We have not lever­aged on these enor­mous re­sources for our own ben­e­fit, in­stead we have al­lowed peo­ple out­side Africa to ex­ploit our re­sources for a pit­tance. Through cor­rup­tion, we have al­lowed in­ter­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions and oli­garchs, un­re­stricted ac­cess to loot. Pre­cious re­sources such as di­a­monds and gold are smug­gled out of Africa and pro­ceeds stashed off­shore by in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies in­stead of be­ing used for de­vel­op­ment of our economies. “It is well known that (African) cen­tral banks are sit­ting on al­most US$500 bil­lion of re­serves and in gen­eral, these are held out­side (Africa) fi­nanc­ing US and Euro­pean debt,” said Bene­dict Oramah, Pres­i­dent of Afrex­im­bank, dur­ing a re­cent in­ter­view. Para­dox­i­cally, Oramah says, “it is those same coun­tries (US and Euro­pean coun­tries) that tell their banks that it is too risky to lend to Africa, and who sub­se­quently with­draw their credit lines to the con­ti­nent for com­pli­ance rea­sons”. It is high time we take con­trol of our re­sources and bring them on­shore to finance de­vel­op­ment and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion and re­duce in­equal­ity and poverty across the con­ti­nent. Dis­rupt­ing colo­nial eco­nomic mod­els Most African coun­tries have per­pet­u­ated the colo­nial mod­els that kept us in the ex­trac­tive stage and ex­port of low value pri­mary prod­ucts prone to price volatil­ity on global mar­kets, while fac­to­ries and in­dus­tries were built and jobs cre­ated in Europe, USA and else­where. This model worked well for Euro­pean coun­tries as they used African raw ma­te­ri­als and pro­duced fin­ished prod­ucts which were sold back to Africa at higher prices. Re­liance on ex­port of pri­mary com­modi­ties, if per­pet­u­ated, will keep Africa poor. Ac­cord­ing to Ak­in­wumi Adesina, Pres­i­dent of the African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB), Africa pro­duces about 75 per­cent of world’s co­coa but re­ceives a pal­try 5 per­cent (US$5 bil­lion) of the US$100 bil­lion global an­nual choco­late mar­ket share. In a nut­shell, the “Africa we want” can only be cre­ated if we think afresh and come up with in­no­va­tive ideas that dis­rupt these in­her­ited colo­nial eco­nomic mod­els that serve the in­ter­ests of for­mer colo­nial states. The AU com­modi­ties strat­egy, “value ad­di­tion for global com­pet­i­tive­ness”, which seeks to lever­age and add value to Africa’s nat­u­ral re­sources, is a game changer if African coun­tries im­ple­ment it fully. Take the dis­rup­tion be­ing caused by Africa’s rich­est man, Aliko Dan­gote, for in­stance. He has taken ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of Nige­ria’s oil to an­other level.

In­dia-Africa trade be­tween 2001 and 2014 in­creased ten­fold, mak­ing the Asian gi­ant Africa’s fourth largest trad­ing part­ner. Africa now ac­counts for close to 10 per­cent of In­dia’s to­tal ex­ter­nal trade.

Lever­ag­ing on AfCFTA, youth The African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) launched at the 12th Ex­tra­or­di­nary Sum­mit of the African Union (AU) in Ni­amey, Niger, in July 2019, is a mile­stone set to break trade bar­ri­ers im­posed on African states via colo­nial­ism. Ac­cord­ing to Afrex­im­bank, in­tra-Africa trade is a pal­try 15 per­cent (US$170 bil­lion) of to­tal con­ti­nen­tal trade com­pared to in­ter­nal Euro­pean trade, which stands at 70 per­cent (US$6 tril­lion). African lead­ers, after decades of pro­cras­ti­na­tion, have now come to ac­cept the old adage that there is strength in num­bers. AfCFTA, which be­comes op­er­a­tional in July 2020, with Ghana host­ing its sec­re­tar­iat, is set to be­come the world’s big­gest eco­nomic trad­ing bloc in­te­grat­ing 54 coun­tries with 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple and a com­bined GDP of US$3,4 tril­lion. AfCFTA will al­low free move­ment of peo­ple, goods, ser­vices, labour and cap­i­tal cross Africa. What is needed now is strong po­lit­i­cal will to im­ple­ment AfCFTA for it to start to bear fruits. As Africa scales greater heights we should not for­get the as­pi­ra­tions of the youth. Out of Africa’s 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple, 60 per­cent (720 mil­lion), are be­low the age of 24. African coun­tries need to cre­ate in­clu­sive economies that pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties, jobs and wealth for these young Africans. African jour­nal­ists The voices of African jour­nal­ists need to in­flu­ence change, mon­i­tor progress and cri­tique short­com­ings of AU trans­for­ma­tion pro­grammes and give praise, where it is due. There are so many things go­ing right in Africa. African jour­nal­ists should re­port on that progress and counter neg­a­tive cov­er­age on Africa from Western me­dia. African jour­nal­ists should stop whin­ing about wrong­do­ing and tell the world the good com­ing out of the mother­land. Un­less African jour­nal­ists learn to give praise where it is due, we will con­tinue in the same mould of the so called “sin­gle African story” that oth­ers have used, for self-in­ter­est, to stereo­type Africa as a spec­ta­cle of laugh­ter in Western me­dia. The “Africa we want” is not hy­po­thet­i­cal, it is real. But to cre­ate it, Africans need to unite and work tire­lessly to guard our re­sources — lever­ag­ing on them for our com­mon good, cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for the youth and re­duc­ing lev­els of in­equal­ity and poverty across Africa.",津巴布韦

In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo called the view that the Bret­ton Woods sys­tem is a panacea for world prob­lems as an “out­dated view” which can­not go un­chal­lenged. The call for recog­nis­ing the emerg­ing eco­nomic pow­ers can­not sim­ply be ig­nored. Asia and Africa rep­re­sent a huge mar­ket within a global con­text to ig­nore. Africa, with 1,1 bil­lion peo­ple and Asia with 4,4 bil­lion peo­ple, to­gether ac­count for three quar­ters of the world’s pop­u­la­tion es­ti­mated at 7,2 bil­lion. The five largest coun­tries by pop­u­la­tion in Africa are Nige­ria (177,5 mil­lion), Ethiopia (95,9 mil­lion), Egypt (87,9 mil­lion), DRC (71,2 mil­lion) and South Africa (53,7 mil­lion). In Asia, the coun­tries are China (1,4 bil­lion), In­dia (1,3 bil­lion), In­done­sia (251,5 mil­lion), Pak­istan (194 mil­lion) and Bangladesh (158,5 mil­lion). The flip­side is that th­ese re­gions ar­guably have the poor­est, hence the need to co­op­er­ate to erad­i­cate poverty and im­prove the stan­dard of living. There is a sig­nif­i­cant need to in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture to connect the two re­gions — in­vest­ment in ports, air­ports, roads and rail to fa­cil­i­tate trade and move­ment of peo­ple. An Africa In­fra­struc­ture Di­ag­nos­tic 2009 re­port es­ti­mates that the fi­nanc­ing re­quire­ment to close Africa’s in­fra­struc­ture deficit amounts to US$93 bil­lion per an­num un­til 2020. Could this be partly re­solved by the new $100 bil­lion Brics bank, the new devel­op­ment bank es­tab­lished by the Brics coun­tries (Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa? Africa is rich with nat­u­ral re­sources but lags be­hind in in­fra­struc­ture and industrial devel­op­ment to fully ben­e­fit from th­ese abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources. Africa has 60% of the world’s arable land. Thirty per­cent of the world’s oil and gas dis­cov­er­ies over the past five years were in sub-sa­ha­ran Africa. South Africa and Zim­babwe hold to­gether the world’s largest plat­inum re­serves. Ramaphosa, the Deputy Pres­i­dent of South Africa pointed out that “Africa’s abil­ity to trade is ham­pered by a lack of phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture”. The need for in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment in Africa can­not be overem­pha­sised and gov­ern­ments within the con­ti­nent must fo­cus on de­liv­er­ing the nec­es­sary in­fra­struc­ture. Hith­erto, the top Asian im­ports from Africa have been com­mod­ity-based with crude oil and gas ac­count­ing for a lion share of im­ports at 58% and ores and met­als ac­counted for a fur­ther 20%. On the other hand, Africa’s im­ports from Asia com­prise a di­ver­si­fied chunk — from ma­chin­ery, ve­hi­cles, elec­tron­ics to pro­cessed food prod­ucts. It’s clear from this im­port-ex­port bal­ance that Africa is still a ba­sic in­put provider to the re­source-hun­gry Asia and pro­vides a mar­ket for the Asian man­u­fac­tured prod­ucts. While so many ini­tia­tives were put on the fore dur­ing the gath­er­ing, im­ple­men­ta­tion will be the lit­mus test. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe pointed out rightly that with­out ac­tual im­ple­men­ta­tion of projects of co­op­er­a­tion, the part­ner­ship “re­mains rit­u­al­is­tic and will serve no par­tic­u­larly com­pelling pur­pose”. China seems to be tak­ing a lead­ing role in the South-south co­op­er­a­tion given its eco­nomic clout. It pro­posed cre­at­ing 100 000 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for de­vel­op­ing na­tions and it plays a sig­nif­i­cant role in the pro­posed Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank (AIIB) and more likely in the Brics bank. The China-pro­posed AIIB, which is open to global membership and has al­ready at­tracted 57 coun­tries, is set to ri­val the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions and the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank (ADB).

An­a­lysts ar­gue there would be “no magic” to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion be­ing cham­pi­oned by the Gov­ern­ment through the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1, with­out mean­ing­ful investment in re­search and de­vel­op­ment. While the Gov­ern­ment has for years been shy to al­lo­cate funds to­wards R&D, in­ter­na­tional ev­i­dence shows that suc­cess­ful coun­tries such as South Korea, Is­rael, Ja­pan and Tai­wan have been al­lo­cat­ing sub­stan­tial amounts into re­search. For in­stance, South Korea, Is­rael, Ja­pan and Tai­wan’s ex­pen­di­ture as a share of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) stood at 4,3 per­cent, 4,9 per­cent, 3,2 per­cent and 3,1 per­cent, re­spec­tively. Sim­i­larly, while investment in re­search and de­vel­op­ment is con­sid­ered the lifeblood of many pri­vate sec­tor or­gan­i­sa­tions, help­ing bring new prod­ucts and ser­vices to mar­ket, many lo­cal com­pa­nies have for long been in the sur­vival mode and would re­quire “cer­tain amount of sta­bil­ity” to start thinking of in­vest­ing in R&D. This year, the Gov­ern­ment plans to spend as much as $5 bil­lion (US$61 mil­lion) in re­search in var­i­ous ar­eas in­clud­ing min­eral and agro-pro­cess­ing pro­grammes for value ad­di­tion, value chains and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion, equip­ping train­ing and re­search and de­vel­op­ment in­sti­tu­tions with state-of-the-art in­fra­struc­ture, ac­cord­ing to the Trea­sury. The funds will also be spend on part­ner­ships with pri­vate, pub­lic and other stake­hold­ers to de­velop state-of-the art re­search in­fra­struc­ture and co­op­er­a­tion mech­a­nisms; and strengthen Cen­tres for Ed­u­ca­tional Re­search, In­no­va­tion and De­vel­op­ment. “It is a mod­est bud­get but more needs to be done,” Car­los Tadya, a re­searcher with a lo­cal think tank said. “It is lifeblood of economies and can en­hance com­pet­i­tive­ness.” In the global econ­omy, when coun­tries are said to be com­pet­i­tive, it is not ac­tu­ally gov­ern­ments that are com­pet­i­tive. Rather, com­pet­i­tive­ness is bol­stered by a vi­brant productive sec­tor, which draws from re­search and de­vel­op­ment, an­a­lysts say. Economist Pro­fes­sor Gift Mugano said in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion must be pow­ered by R&D. “We have to be in­no­va­tive in our ap­proach to in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion,” he told The Her­ald Busi­ness and Fi­nance in an interview. “Un­de­ni­ably, in my view, in­no­va­tion is an out­put of re­search while in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion be­comes the out­come. “What this teaches us is that we must get the right for­mula on in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and it has to start with teach­ing, re­search, in­no­va­tion and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, which is a pol­icy be­ing spear­headed by Pro­fes­sor Mur­wira un­der Education 5.0. “How­ever, in my view, the real im­ped­i­ment to the suc­cess of the Education 5.0 is fund­ing.” In the 2021 Na­tional Bud­get, Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube said the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and de­vel­op­ment agenda re­lied on re­search and de­vel­op­ment as the coun­try pur­sue the NDS 1 to­wards Vi­sion 2030. “There­fore, re­search in var­i­ous sec­tors will be given req­ui­site pri­or­ity in pro­mot­ing in­no­va­tion, science, tech­nol­ogy and in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment,” said Pro­fes­sor Ncube. Prof Mugano noted some ad­vanced economies such as United States, China, Ger­man and France re­spec­tively al­lo­cated ex­pen­di­ture as a share of GDP equiv­a­lent to 2,7 per­cent, 2,1 per­cent, 2,9 per­cent and 2,2 per­cent. “This is the rea­son why their economies are char­ac­terised by in­dus­trial com­plex­i­ties and these are the same coun­tries, which are driv­ing the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion when most of our economies es­pe­cially in Africa are en­trenched in prim­i­tive economies which are largely ex­trac­tive,” said Pro­fes­sor Mugano. South Korea, with a sin­gle min­eral, es­caped poverty through re­search and de­vel­op­ment, which saw the coun­try be­ing a house­hold name in in­ter­na­tional brands such as Sum­sang, Kia, Hyundai, LG and is the leader in ship build­ing, he added. “In the re­gion, al­though South Africa and Botswana al­lo­cates ex­pen­di­ture, which is equal to 0,8 per­cent and 0,3 per­cent, re­spec­tively to their gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, it is still mean­ing­ful in help­ing these coun­tries in in­form­ing their in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion game plans and it is for all of us to see how our econ­omy is dif­fer­ent from these economies in terms of eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion,” added Pro­fes­sor Mugano. In­dus­tri­al­ist Mr Bu­sisa Moyo said while it was crit­i­cal for the pri­vate sec­tor to in­vest in R&D, com­pa­nies needed to be more fi­nan­cially sta­ble to fund such pro­grammes. “Once you are in the sur­vival mode, thinking long term is very dif­fi­cult,” said Mr Moyo, is also the chief ex­ec­u­tive of United Re­finer­ies. “That will re­quire a cer­tain amount of sta­bil­ity. Cur­rently, the ur­gency is the en­emy of strate­gic,” he added. With the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area that came into force on Jan­uary, 1 2021, an­a­lysts said cor­po­rate re­search and de­vel­op­ment would en­hance com­petive­ness of Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies and re­duce the risk of los­ing ground to ri­val firms.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200515,Give African medicines a chance,"THE world is scram­bling to get a treat­ment for Covid- 19. To date, save from the Mada­gas­car cure claim, the world has not dis­cov­ered any­thing to treat Covid-19. Sad is that what­ever comes from Africa is dis­missed with con­tempt ex­pos­ing the world for its hypocrisy. De­vel­oped coun­tries are the only ones who claim to have a God-given power to re­search, find, pro­duce and sell the treat­ment for any ail­ment. The an­nounce­ment by Mada­gas­car that they found the treat­ment of Covid19 in­fu­ri­ated global super pow­ers. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) also warned Mada­gas­car and in a state­ment said it did not rec­om­mend “self-med­i­ca­tion with any medicines . . . as a preven­tion or cure for Covid-19”. The world is in a time of cri­sis, and it needs all na­tions to first find an ur­gent so­lu­tion to curb the rate of dam­age whilst look­ing for per­ma­nent so­lu­tion. If Mada­gas­car was in Amer­ica or Europe, their med­i­ca­tion would have been ap­proved. As long as it is an African na­tion and re­garded as less hu­man no coun­try will be al­lowed to use that med­i­ca­tion. WHO in­stead of be­ing an im­par­tial body seems to be con­trolled by the pow­ers that be. It is high time for WHO to ask Mada­gas­car how they made it pos­si­ble. In Africa, herbal medicines have been sav­ing lives since time im­memo­rial even be­fore the emer­gence of Covid-19. Re­cent events make it clear that Africa will al­ways be looked down upon, while other con­ti­nents jump to ex­per­i­ment their find­ings on Africans. WHO de­scribes tra­di­tional medicine, “as the sum to­tal of the knowl­edge, skills, and prac­tices based on the the­o­ries, be­liefs, and ex­pe­ri­ences in­dige­nous to dif­fer­ent cul­tures, whether ex­pli­ca­ble or not, used in the main­te­nance of health as well as in the preven­tion, di­ag­no­sis, im­prove­ment, or treat­ment of phys­i­cal and men­tal ill­ness.” Most tra­di­tional medicines sys­tems are passed down from gen­er­a­tion to gen­er­a­tion through ver­bal teach­ing. To date, in some parts of the world, the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion con­tinue to rely on their own tra­di­tional medicine to meet their pri­mary health care needs. When adopted out­side of its tra­di­tional cul­ture, tra­di­tional medicine is of­ten re­ferred as “com­ple­men­tary and al­ter­na­tive medicine.” Among oth­ers, the most widely used tra­di­tional medicine sys­tems to­day in­clude those of China, In­dia, and Africa. African tra­di­tional medicine can fur­ther be de­scribed as a form of holis­tic health care sys­tem or­gan­ised into three lev­els of spe­cialty, namely div­ina­tion, spir­i­tu­al­ism, and herbal­ism. Past re­search pa­pers prove that the tra­di­tional healer pro­vides health care ser­vices based on cul­ture, reli­gious back­ground, knowl­edge, at­ti­tudes, and be­liefs that are preva­lent in his com­mu­nity. Ac­cord­ing to a re­search by Ezek­we­sili-Ofili et al, ill­ness is re­garded as hav­ing both nat­u­ral and su­per­nat­u­ral causes and thus must be treated by both phys­i­cal and spir­i­tual means, us­ing div­ina­tion, in­can­ta­tions, an­i­mal sac­ri­fice, ex­or­cism, and herbs. Herbal medicine is the cor­ner­stone of tra­di­tional medicine, but may in­clude min­er­als and an­i­mal parts. Ma­jor ob­sta­cles to the use of African medic­i­nal plants are their poor qual­ity con­trol and safety. The safety is­sue is de­ter­mined by none Africans for Africa. Be­cause those who suf­fer from su­pe­ri­or­ity com­plex scorn tra­di­tional medicine, its prac­tices are still shrouded with much se­crecy, with few re­ports or doc­u­men­ta­tions of ad­verse re­ac­tions. African medicine has a very bright fu­ture if viewed in the con­text of ser­vice pro­vi­sion, in­crease of health care cov­er­age, eco­nomic po­ten­tial, and poverty re­duc­tion. For­mal recog­ni­tion and in­te­gra­tion of tra­di­tional medicine into con­ven­tional medicine will hold much prom­ise for the fu­ture. Be­cause tra­di­tional medicine is frowned upon most peo­ple will use it, but will not record its suc­cess. How can the Western world take our medicine se­ri­ously when we fail to do so our­selves? In or­der for our medicine to be ac­cepted we need to al­low phar­ma­cog­nosy. This is the study of the phys­i­cal, chem­i­cal, bio­chem­i­cal, and bi­o­log­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of nat­u­ral prod­ucts for medic­i­nal or health ben­e­fit pur­poses. Specif­i­cally, this area must en­com­pass the study of sec­ondary me­tab­o­lites, in­clud­ing al­ka­loids, gly­co­sides, phe­no­lic com­pounds, tan­nins, phy­tos­terols, and ter­penoids that are de­rived from na­ture, and is in­clu­sive of plants as well as ma­rine and ter­res­trial mi­crobes and an­i­mals. These com­pounds have po­ten­tial medic­i­nal ap­pli­ca­tions for the preven­tion and treat­ment of nu­mer­ous con­di­tions and diseases, and may also serve as nat­u­ral pes­ti­cides and her­bi­cides. Re­cently, Zim­babwe le­galised the med­i­cal cannabis which would see our health sys­tem de­velop and which will bring mil­lions in our econ­omy. Stake­hold­ers have gar­nered new in­ter­est per­tain­ing to a sus­tain­able ap­proach to cannabis and nat­u­ral prod­uct re­search and drug de­vel­op­ment, an area now le­galised for the ben­e­fit of the na­tion. On the cannabis field some in­vestors pre­tend to be very clever and try to out­smart their lo­cal part­ners. This hap­pens when peo­ple think they are more clever than oth­ers. Drugs of nat­u­ral ori­gin, which have roots in many med­i­cal tra­di­tions, are of in­or­di­nate sig­nif­i­cance due to the sub­stan­tial growth in us­age around the world. In ad­di­tion, na­ture-based medicines are the topic of in­creased in­quiry in the quest for novel phar­ma­cophores that hold the prospect of en­hanced ther­apy. Covid-19 has not moved at a fast rate in Africa than it has done in Europe and China. This should show the world that a cure maybe found in Africa. The Mada­gas­car Covid-19 cure must be taken to the lab, tested and de­vel­oped at a larger scale to ben­e­fit ev­ery­one. The award of the 2015 No­bel Prize in Phys­i­ol­ogy or Medicine went to a pro­fes­sor who used African na­ture drugs to pro­duce na­ture-based drugs Aver­mectin and Artemisinin, used in the treat­ment of in­fec­tions caused by round­worm par­a­sites and malaria, re­spec­tively, un­der­scores such trends, and high­lights, in par­tic­u­lar, the po­ten­tial value of nat­u­rally de­rived medicines in tar­get­ing ne­glected trop­i­cal diseases. Which means a virus like Covid- 19 can be treated in Africa. If we treat this with­out prej­u­dice a cure from Mure­hwa in Zim­babwe known as zum­bani and the same zum­bani found in Mada­gas­car will have been taken to lab­o­ra­to­ries and more lives will have been saved. As hu­mans ex­ploit na­ture’s unique gifts for al­le­vi­at­ing dis­ease, this should be achieved with safety, sus­tain­abil­ity, and eq­ui­table ben­e­fit-shar­ing con­sid­er­a­tions in mind. It is high time Africa must stand up and shame the devil. Our medicine should be ac­cepted with­out seg­re­ga­tion or dis­crim­i­na­tion.",津巴布韦

Jus­tice Man­gota dis­missed the ap­pli­ca­tion with costs, ar­gu­ing that Chamisa’s party failed to prove the use of po­lice and mil­i­tary in the takeover. “I have con­sid­ered all the cir­cum­stances of HC2811/20 and HC 2814/20,” part of the rul­ing read. “I am sat­is­fied that the ap­pli­cants in each case failed to prove their ap­pli­ca­tions on a bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ties.

Key is con­sen­sus in gov­er­nance, and it is lack­ing,” Chamisa said. “State has the hard power, the peo­ple have soft power but the State is be­hav­ing like a bull in a China shop, yet it should be the ser­vant of the peo­ple. The so­cial con­tract be­tween peo­ple and the State is bro­ken.” Chamisa said the sit­u­a­tion in the coun­try had reached boil­ing point and it was time for mass protests against Mnan­gagwa’s “failed regime.” He said the peo­ple de­served a le­git­i­mate, ca­pa­ble State, adding change was in­evitable. Asked if he was not in­cit­ing peo­ple to protest, Chamisa said: “What in­cite­ment, the Con­sti­tu­tion al­lows peo­ple to demon­strate. It is ac­tu­ally the govern­ment that is in­cit­ing peo­ple by ne­glect­ing their wel­fare. When you give in­sight, you are not in­cit­ing. Protests are an ac­cept­able con­sti­tu­tional way of ex­press­ing dis­plea­sure.” The coun­try is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a se­ri­ous eco­nomic cri­sis char­ac­terised by in­fla­tion, short­age of ba­sic goods and loss of value of the lo­cal cur­rency as well pe­ri­odic civil and po­lit­i­cal un­rest. Mnan­gagwa has blamed sanc­tions for haem­or­rhag­ing the econ­omy, but ob­servers say his govern­ment’s pol­icy in­con­sis­ten­cies and cor­rup­tion are to blame. Chamisa added: “We are at a tip­ping point of ex­plo­sion. On the back of poor poli­cies, we see the to­tal demise of the Zim­bab­wean dol­lar and full dol­lar­i­sa­tion which has seen govern­ment ditch­ing its own cur­rency. “Zim­babwe is sink­ing courtesy of bad poli­cies and bad lead­er­ship caus­ing ab­ject poverty and un­told suf­fer­ing. Take pol­icy in­con­sis­tency and re­ver­sals for ex­am­ple, the ter­mi­na­tion of the mul­ti­ple cur­rency regime in favour of the lo­cal cur­rency and later on re­turn back to dol­lar­i­sa­tion in less than a year.” “There is a liq­uid­ity crunch, cou­pled with food in­se­cu­rity, high un­em­ploy­ment and high in­ca­pac­i­ta­tion across peo­ple, work­ers, govern­ment, busi­ness and ab­sence of ex­ter­nal sup­port, the econ­omy is head­ing for to­tal col­lapse.” Chamisa said there was need for a sound stim­u­lus pack­age of around US$5 bil­lion and in the ab­sence of that, the econ­omy would to­tally col­lapse. Zim­babwe is faced with a se­ri­ous eco­nomic cri­sis that has seen work­ers in the health sec­tor down­ing tools, de­mand­ing wages in United States dol­lars. Govern­ment last week an­nounced a 50% salary in­crease for civil ser­vants plus a US$75 a month COVID-19 al­lowance, but the work­ers have re­jected the of­fer.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200612,The me­dia can spear­head change of mind­set for de­vel­op­ment to oc­cur,"SOME­WHERE in May 2010, an email popped up ask­ing if I was in­ter­ested in a reg­u­lar col­umn for a new daily news­pa­per to be launched in June that year. “They are look­ing for new names and new ideas,” said the email. With­out flinch­ing, I grabbed the op­por­tu­nity. I wanted to fo­cus on de­vel­op­ment — an im­por­tant area that re­mains ne­glected by the me­dia. Most jour­nal­ists and an­a­lysts, even to­day, go for the ob­vi­ous easy pick­ings such as pol­i­tics, eco­nom­ics, arts, sports and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion-driven sub­jects such as hu­man rights, en­vi­ron­ment etc. It was and re­mains my con­tention that de­vel­op­ment un­der­lies ev­ery­thing and the me­dia must in­vest in re­cast­ing the African mind­set to­wards de­vel­op­ment. It is the en­ergy that drives so­ci­ety’s as­pi­ra­tion to be bet­ter which de­fines its stand­ing against others. Once a so­ci­ety de­vel­ops, ev­ery­thing else falls into place. Af­ter a few email ex­changes with the edi­to­rial team, the col­umn De­velop Me was born. That was not with­out un­der­ly­ing fears. I had writ­ten for var­i­ous lo­cal news­pa­pers be­fore us­ing a pseu­do­nym be­cause I did not want to be as­so­ci­ated with edi­to­rial poli­cies tied to po­lit­i­cal po­si­tions or par­ties. I found that to be sti­fling ob­jec­tiv­ity and abil­ity to ex­press opin­ions freely with­out fear­ing cen­sor­ship. So, I in­quired. “Tapiwa, do your thing,” came the re­sponse. That free­dom of thought and abil­ity to ex­press my­self with­out fear­ing edi­to­rial cen­sor­ship char­ac­terised the jour­ney of more than 520 weekly in­stal­ments over a decade. Dur­ing that decade, I cov­ered var­i­ous top­ics per­tain­ing to African de­vel­op­ment, in­clud­ing pol­i­tics, eco­nom­ics, elec­tion cam­paigns, cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment of na­tional re­sources. I also ex­posed the lies in party man­i­festos ahead of elec­tions and drew ideas from other suc­cess sto­ries such as Rwanda, Ethiopia, China, Mau­ri­tius, the Mid­dle East and any others. This I did to demon­strate that de­vel­op­ment is pos­si­ble. I ad­vanced and re­it­er­ated the idea that de­vel­op­ment oc­curs faster when it is lo­cally driven. I ar­gued that it oc­curs when lead­er­ship har­nesses the power of faith of its peo­ple, their re­silience and their de­sire for a bet­ter life and dig­ni­fied so­cial sta­tus, among others. It is not the just a be­lief, but the heart­beat of every in­di­vid­ual. It is the rea­son lives were lost in the war — to over­turn tyranny, earn the free­dom to self-de­fine and to be bet­ter through work, in­no­va­tion and achieve a com­mon and greater good. The in­gre­di­ents to achieve this are sim­ple; a lead­er­ship with a vision and the hu­man cap­i­tal from cit­i­zens. The abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources are an added ad­van­tage. There are sev­eral coun­tries least en­dowed with nat­u­ral re­sources who are among global economies such as Ja­pan. We have more than we need ex­cept the right mind­set. If de­vel­op­ment is this sim­ple, why is it not hap­pen­ing in Zim­babwe? It is not easy to ex­on­er­ate coloni­sa­tion in ad­dress­ing this ques­tion even though it is also not an ad­e­quate jus­ti­fi­ca­tion or ex­cuse for our poverty. It is vi­tal to note the two ob­jec­tives of coloni­sa­tion. First was to es­tab­lish a sub­mis­sive mind­set loyal to its sys­tem; and sec­ond to ex­ploit re­sources of poor states. These are sus­tained by uni­ver­sal knowl­edge frames and trad­ing sys­tems which to­gether es­tab­lished a loyal and de­pen­dent mind­set to the sys­tem. The emerg­ing schol­arly ar­gu­ment on de­coloni­sa­tion is an at­tempt to ex­or­cise this colo­nial de­mon. That might be an­other waste of time. His­tory shows us that so­ci­eties es­cape bondage by re­defin­ing and re­fin­ing them­selves than un­do­ing the past. That is de­bate for an­other day. What are the im­pli­ca­tions of the rem­nants of the colo­nial mind­set and why is this im­por­tant to the me­dia in Africa? Ask any jour­nal­ist or or­di­nary cit­i­zens what needs to be done to im­prove their lives, they will give ei­ther a po­lit­i­cal, fi­nan­cial or re­li­gious an­swer. Nei­ther democ­racy, money nor curse are gen­uine prob­lems in Africa but ex­cept that mind­set. The colonised mind­set po­si­tions it­self as a help­less vic­tim of a prob­lem for which they do not see them­selves as part of the so­lu­tion. It is that African mind­set that the me­dia in Zim­babwe must res­cue so our peo­ple can spear­head their own de­vel­op­ment. This is not the­o­ret­i­cal. Zim­babwe is stuck in the be­lief that fix­ing the po­lit­i­cal ques­tion comes first be­fore de­vel­op­ment. We are ob­sessed with democ­racy and we have di­verted our at­ten­tion from devel­op­men­tal mat­ters amid lim­ited ev­i­dence link­ing the two. This not to un­der­es­ti­mate the value of democ­racy, but to em­pha­sise that it is hard to pur­sue democ­racy with­out sub­mit­ting to whims of im­pe­rial pow­ers who colonised us and who con­trol and ma­nip­u­late demo­cratic po­lit­i­cal sys­tems. Op­po­si­tion par­ties rush to western em­bassies when they are aggrieved while rul­ing politi­cians save their loot in western coun­tries in case they are ejected by the same western pow­ers. The po­lit­i­cal sys­tem we adopted makes it easy to be con­trolled and ma­nip­u­lated. It is for this rea­son I con­tend that democ­racy must be an out­come of de­vel­op­ment and not po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism. When a so­ci­ety de­vel­ops, meets its ba­sic needs, grows eco­nom­i­cally and its peo­ple start to self-ac­tu­alise, the next stage is democ­racy. An­other colo­nial rem­nant that has weak­ened us and made us de­pen­dent on the same colo­nial sys­tem is how our mind­set has been con­fig­ured to cen­tralise money in ev­ery­thing we do. Money is cen­tral to how we de­fine prob­lems, ad­dress them and see suc­cess. We miss the point that colo­nial­ists in­vaded Africa not to make money but to cre­ate wealth — to con­vert zero from our nat­u­ral re­sources into eco­nomic value, to cre­ate an eco­nomic stock on which their democ­racy and global power are founded. This is why they in­vested in in­fra­struc­ture to fa­cil­i­tate and max­imise pro­duc­tion in­stead of sell­ing raw ma­te­ri­als. This is also why a western in­vestor is com­fort­able pay­ing a kick­back to an African leader to se­cure a min­ing deal to cre­ate wealth. They know we love money and we think it is wealth. Money is only a medium of ex­change, a per­ish­able prod­uct and with­out wealth, it is mean­ing­less. Ac­quir­ing money through wealth cre­ation is faster and more sus­tain­able than ac­quir­ing wealth through money. Lack of money should not im­pede de­vel­op­ment or be an ex­cuse for poverty. The third fac­tor that has kept the African mind­set sub­mis­sive and un­able to be more proac­tive to ad­dress their devel­op­men­tal needs is re­li­gion. Ev­i­dence sug­gests that the world’s poor­est coun­tries are also the most re­li­gious. Colo­nial­ism was about con­trol­ling the mind­set which is why it re­placed African re­li­gion with its own. Re­li­gion is non-pro­duc­tive and yet it is a ma­jor crowd puller in Africa. The cur­rent gen­er­a­tion’s re­li­gious be­lief sys­tem re­flects the colo­nial for­ma­tive or re­for­ma­tive years. It cre­ated a loyal cit­i­zen who tows the line and never thinks out­side the box as do­ing so would be hereti­cal. It cre­ated an in­di­vid­ual who dis­tances him­self from tak­ing lead­er­ship and own­er­ship and one who sees de­vel­op­ment as a bless­ing from God. Re­li­gion blurs peo­ple from see­ing things as they are but through the lenses it pre­scribes upon them. The more one prays and sub­mit, the likely they will be blessed. Suc­cess is not an out­come of hard work but a re­ward or bless­ing from God — it pre­scribes. Coun­tries that have made it, have self-de­fined, in­no­vated and made use of their hu­man cap­i­tal and avail­able re­sources to es­tab­lish lo­cally-owned and driven economies and they only ac­quired ex­ter­nal ca­pac­i­ties to com­ple­ment lo­cal ef­forts. The role of lead­er­ship is to steer the na­tion to­wards de­vel­op­ment goals. It is not about con­form­ing to ex­ter­nal dic­tates, but re­spond­ing to na­tional de­vel­op­ment needs. It is time our me­dia re­alised that our pol­i­tics are de­struc­tive and they have a role to re­shape the na­tional agenda and give more promi­nence to the de­vel­op­ment agenda. Tapiwa Gomo is a de­vel­op­ment con­sul­tant based in Pre­to­ria, South Africa.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180406,China visit lays foun­da­tion of new eco­nomic or­der,"THE his­toric visit to China by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa this week was sig­nif­i­cant in many ways. While Zim­babwe is in a new dis­pen­sa­tion fol­low­ing the as­cen­dancy of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa last year, it is im­por­tant to note that his visit to China opened a new era in re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries. The new dis­pen­sa­tion in Zim­babwe has brought re­newed hope of eco­nomic progress and a lot of ex­pec­ta­tion that the coun­try is fi­nally on the right path to de­vel­op­ment. Un­der the mantra “Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is leav­ing no stone un­turned in a bid to en­sure that the coun­try grows its econ­omy. In that eco­nomic growth, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment is most wel­come to help cat­a­pult the coun­try to its de­sired lev­els. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has de­clared that by 2030 Zim­babwe should be a mid­dle in­come coun­try, but it is clear that the coun­try can­not go it alone to achieve that. It is a fact that years of eco­nomic sanc­tions from West­ern coun­tries have taken a toll on the coun­try’s in­fra­struc­ture which is nec­es­sary for help­ing achieve the vi­sion of eco­nomic progress. It is in this con­text that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s State visit to China be­comes use­ful. China has a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­per­tise in the es­tab­lish­ment of nec­es­sary in­fra­struc­ture to aid eco­nomic de­vel­op­men­tal goals. If Zim­babwe taps into this ex­per­tise, as Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has in­di­cated Gov­ern­ment will do, then very soon the coun­try will be­gin to re­alise the fruition of its vi­sion. Of course, China is not the only coun­try with such an ex­per­tise, but com­pared to other coun­tries, the Asian coun­try has shown its will­ing­ness to aid Zim­babwe in achiev­ing its en­deav­ours. West­ern coun­tries, for ex­am­ple, have in the past been un­will­ing to help Zim­babwe in its de­vel­op­men­tal goals, hence the im­po­si­tion of crip­pling sanc­tions. In re­cent years, China has em­barked on huge in­fras­truc­tural projects in Zim­babwe. The up­grad­ing and re­do­ing of the Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port at a cost of nearly $150 mil­lion was a huge state­ment on the Chi­nese’s ca­pac­ity to help de­velop Zim­babwe’s in­fra­struc­ture Vic­to­ria Falls has been en­joy­ing a boon in tourist ar­rivals since 2016 when the air­port was com­mis­sioned af­ter the works done by Chi­nese firm Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional. For in­stance, re­ports in­di­cate that there was an 18,5 per­cent in­crease in hotel oc­cu­pancy in Vic­to­ria Falls in 2017, com­pared to 2016, with an ad­di­tional 35 730 rooms sold across 10 ho­tels, which to­gether have 1 125 rooms avail­able per night. The com­mis­sion­ing of Kariba South Power Sta­tion Ex­ten­sion Project by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa on Thurs­day last week is an­other mile­stone in the eco­nomic re­la­tions be­tween Zim­babwe and China. The project was car­ried out by Chi­nese firm Si­no­hy­dro at a cost of $533 mil­lion and added an­other 300 megawatts to the na­tional grid. The av­er­age daily power de­mand for Zim­babwe is about 1 600 megawatts, against a back­drop of an av­er­age in­ter­nal gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­ity of 1 200 megawatts. This means that the com­mis­sion­ing of the Kariba South Power Sta­tion will go a long way in re­duc­ing the im­por­ta­tion bill of the out­stand­ing 600 megawatts. Apart from these re­cent in­fras­truc­tural projects, there are a lot that de­fines eco­nomic re­la­tions be­tween China and Zim­babwe in other ar­eas like agri­cul­ture and man­u­fac­tur­ing. It is on the back­ground of the new dis­pen­sa­tion that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa vis­ited China for his first State visit out­side Africa since his in­au­gu­ra­tion in Novem­ber last year. That alone shows the sig­nif­i­cance of re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries, and the ea­ger­ness of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to take the re­la­tions to a new level. From events that took place dur­ing Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s visit to the Asian coun­try, it be­came clear that a new com­pre­hen­sive eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion has been es­tab­lished be­tween the two coun­tries. China is a well-known po­lit­i­cal ally of Zim­babwe dat­ing back to the days of the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle. While the strong po­lit­i­cal ties con­tin­ued even af­ter in­de­pen­dence in 1980, it was clear that co­op­er­a­tion in the eco­nomic sphere was lag­ging. Now the game has changed and the fo­cus is shift­ing fast to re­la­tions that ben­e­fit peo­ple from both na­tions, while main­tain­ing the strong po­lit­i­cal ties. It is a fact that in the past, peo­ple in China and Zim­babwe were not happy with the slow pace that char­ac­terised eco­nomic re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries. A num­ber of projects have been stalled, much to the cha­grin of of­fi­cials and peo­ple who are ea­ger to see ben­e­fits be­ing driven out of such projects. It is in this con­text that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s visit to China can also be partly viewed. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports from Bei­jing, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa and Pres­i­dent Xi man­aged to re­view the pre­vi­ous projects and look at the im­ped­i­ments that stalled progress in the past. The new com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship of co­op­er­a­tion agreed be­tween the two lead­ers is ex­pected to usher a new way of do­ing busi­ness. It is im­por­tant that Pres­i­dent Xi ac­knowl­edged that Zim­bab­weans have started a new jour­ney in build­ing the coun­try since Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa came into of­fice last year. Ob­vi­ously, thanks to the new dis­pen­sa­tion and the meet­ing be­tween the two lead­ers, the long-term close re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries is fac­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has de­clared that it is no longer busi­ness as usual in Zim­babwe. This state­ment should jolt of­fi­cials re­spon­si­ble for im­ple­ment­ing projects into ac­tion. Wran­gles among of­fi­cials that char­ac­terised the im­ple­men­ta­tion of de­vel­op­men­tal projects in the past should just come to an end and every­one should pull in the same di­rec­tion. Such wran­gles have de­layed the im­ple­men­ta­tion of projects like the con­struc­tion of the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ware­house, whose deal was signed be­tween Zim­babwe and China more than two years ago. Sources have in­di­cated that af­ter all the pre­lim­i­nary work, in­clud­ing a fea­si­bil­ity study, were car­ried out, some of­fi­cials started shift­ing goal posts and wanted the project to be im­ple­mented on a new site in Bu­l­awayo. Pro­tracted ar­gu­ments on the proper site fol­lowed, un­til it was agreed that the ware­house would be built on the orig­i­nal site in Harare. But two years had al­ready passed with the project stalled due to such un­nec­es­sary wran­gles. It is im­por­tant that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is well aware of such un­be­com­ing be­hav­iour among Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials that has stalled im­ple­men­ta­tion of im­por­tant projects. In his in­ter­view with China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work dur­ing his visit in Bei­jing, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said projects will now be re­viewed con­stantly to re­move im­ped­i­ments to progress. “There is a lot to talk about (in terms of projects be­ing im­ple­mented be­tween Zim­babwe and China), if there is any de­lay, let us have an op­por­tu­nity to say let us in­ter­ro­gate our de­ci­sions of April, why has this not been done,” he said. “We re­view whether or not our im­ple­ment­ing agen­cies are match­ing our vi­sion.” In fact, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said in that in­ter­view that they ex­pected that by Septem­ber this year, projects he dis­cussed with Pres­i­dent Xi would have started be­ing im­ple­mented. These in­clude the con­struc­tion of the new Par­lia­ment Build­ing, ex­pan­sion of Robert Gabriel Mu­gabe In­ter­na­tional Air­port, con­struc­tion of Hwange Units 7 and 8 and con­struc­tion of dams. Pres­i­dent Xi has said China stands ready to jointly lay out a new blue­print of bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion for the ben­e­fit of the peo­ple in both coun­tries. He said the visit by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa demon­strated high im­por­tance he at­tached to bi­lat­eral ties with China. It is ex­pected that with the new dis­pen­sa­tion in Zim­babwe, the re­la­tions will now emerge even fresher and stronger. Pres­i­dent Xi also en­cour­aged both sides to dove­tail de­vel­op­ment strate­gies, en­hance co­op­er­a­tion on the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and within the frame­work of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC), and con­tinue to pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion in in­fra­struc­ture con­struc­tion, agri­cul­ture, in­vest­ment and fi­nanc­ing. He said China sup­ports Zim­babwe in ex­plor­ing a de­vel­op­ment path in line with its own na­tional con­di­tions. It im­por­tant that Zim­babwe takes ad­van­tage of such good­will to learn how China de­vel­oped it­self from poverty in 1978 to be­come the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160314,Why lo­cal pro­cure­ment mat­ters,"The strength of the lo­cal in­dus­try is in­te­gral to the stan­dard of liv­ing and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of any na­tion. IN FACT, a healthy in­dus­try is a key cat­a­lyst of eco­nomic growth. For the lo­cal in­dus­try to op­er­ate at full ca­pac­ity, mar­ket play­ers that is the govern­ment, pro­duc­ers and the con­sumers all have a role to play. Con­sumers must “buy lo­cal” when­ever they can, pro­duc­ers must strive to pro­duce qual­ity goods at com­pet­i­tive prices and govern­ment should for­mu­late poli­cies that sup­port the sus­tain­able growth of lo­cal in­dus­tries mak­ing sure that this growth trans­lates into poverty re­duc­tion, eco­nomic growth and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Lo­cal pro­cure­ment is the process of ob­tain­ing per­son­nel, sup­plies and equip­ment from in­dige­nous sources and can be de­signed to specif­i­cally pro­mote in­dus­try in an econ­omy. It’s anal­o­gous to an im­port sub­sti­tu­tion pol­icy that also sup­ports the pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion of lo­cal goods. Many ben­e­fits can be re­alised from lo­cal pro­cure­ment. Firstly, in­dus­try has the larg- est em­ploy­ment and out­put out­liers, with wages in in­dus­try be­ing com­par­a­tively high. Lo­cally owned busi­nesses in­ject most of their cap­i­tal back into their coun­try other than the for­eign owned ones who may seek to rein­vest prof­its back to their orig­i­nal coun­tries. This cre­ates “growth from within” as lo­cal work­ers earn wages and in­come, giv­ing them ac­ces­si­bil­ity to ba­sic needs thereby erad­i­cat­ing poverty. Em­ploy­ment also re­sults in self-reliance. Govern­ment re­sources are very scarce es­pe­cially in the Zim­bab­wean case where cor­rup­tion lev­els are too high. Govern­ment is there­fore un­able to cater for a greater part of the pop­u­la­tion. Job se­cu­rity makes peo­ple self-reliant such that you are not a bur­den to the na­tion. Lo­cal res­i­dents with roots in the econ­omy are also in­volved in key de­vel­op­ment de­ci­sions that shape their lives and lo­cal en­vi­ron­ment. In­creased lo­cal pro­duc­tion and jobs lead to a greater tax rev­enue base which is crit­i­cal for Zim­babwe at the mo­ment for it will cover govern­ment ex­pen­di­ture as well as govern­ment debt. Lo­cal pro­cure­ment will also help in keep­ing money in the econ­omy and not flush­ing away our money to other economies. The re­place­ment of one dol­lar’s worth of im­ports with lo­cal prod­ucts is as ef­fec­tive in gen­er­at­ing na­tional eco­nomic growth and ex­pan­sion as the creation of one dol­lar’s worth of ex­ports. Zim­babwe will not be the first coun­try to sup­port lo­cal pro­cure­ment. Im­port sub­sti­tu­tion has grown into an in­dis­pens­able and in­ter­na­tion­ally shared method of achiev­ing eco­nomic sta­bil­ity. America at some point adopted a “Buy Amer­i­can” act which stip­u­lated that cer­tain fed­eral state and lo­cal govern­ment en­ti­ties pro­cure lo­cally. This was in an ef­fort to in­dus­tri­alise. China cur­rently is­sued di­rec­tives man­dat­ing all GSM equip­ment pur­chased in China to be pro­duced do­mes­ti­cally. This has re­sulted in China suc­cess­fully cre­at­ing a boom­ing in­dus­try that can sus­tain its peo­ple. His­tory in Zim­babwe also sug­gests that lo­cal pro­cure­ment can in­deed “heal” our trou­bled econ­omy. The breakup of the Fed­er­a­tion of Rhode­sia and Nyasa­land in 1963, was fol­lowed in 1965 by the UDI which in­tro­duced a new era of in­ward look­ing im­port sub­sti­tu­tion poli­cies. In 1965, man­u­fac­tur­ing alone ac­counted for 17per­cent of GDP. By the end of this pe­riod it had risen to 24 per­cent and the range of prod­ucts rose dra­mat­i­cally. Con­versely, it should be noted that im­port sub­sti­tu­tion and ex­port ori­en­ta­tion are not mu­tu­ally exclusive. They can act as com­pli­men­tary strate­gies in achiev­ing growth and eco­nomic sta­bil­ity. We can, how­ever, only ex­port af­ter we have fed our­selves and our peo­ple. By procur­ing lo­cally, we save money and by ex­port­ing we gen­er­ate rev­enue which we can then use to clear our debts and bal­ance our neg­a­tive trade bal­ance. Im­port sub­sti­tu­tion will be used to de­velop lo­cal in­dus­try un­til it reaches a level at which it can com- pete in the for­eign mar­ket. An ex­port pro­mo­tion strat­egy will aid in in­creas­ing ex­ports. How­ever, for these strate­gies to work there is need for a huge in­ter­nal de­mand that is lo­cal pro­cure­ment. The over­whelm­ing pos­i­tive im­pact of con­sum­ing lo­cal prod­ucts, as sup­ported by the­ory and some prac­ti­cal ex­am­ples leads us to the con­clu­sion that lo­cal pro­cure­ment is one of the ma­jor strate­gies Zim­babwe can use to re­vive its grim econ­omy. There needs to be a re­struc­tur­ing of the econ­omy’s con­sump­tion pat­terns where con­sumers are im­parted with the knowl­edge on the ben­e­fits of “buy­ing lo­cal”. With the cur­rent mar­ket con­di­tions and the ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the dol­lar over cur­ren­cies in nearby coun­tries, it has be­come in­creas­ingly cheaper to buy im­ported goods de­spite the in­creased costs of pack­ag­ing, trans­porta­tion, in­spec­tion and as­so­ci­ated ex­penses. How­ever, along with lower prices comes the added cost of im­pacts on the eco­nomic well-be­ing of your com­mu­nity and your na­tion as a whole. Ev­ery­one plays a role. It’s not up to the govern­ment to re­vive the econ­omy. We all have a part to play. Buy lo­cal; make it your busi­ness to grow Zim­bab­wean in­dus­try back to its glory days when it was the “jewel of Africa”. Buy Zim­babwe for pride, wealth and jobs!!!! ◆ Faith Man­gena is an Econ­o­mist with the Buy Zim­babwe Trust. The views ex­pressed in this ar­ti­cle solely be­long to the writer.",津巴布韦
zw,The Manica Post,20170224,Govt al­lo­cates $8m to Marovany­ati Dam,"GOVERN­MENT has al­lo­cated $8 mil­lion to­wards the con­struc­tion of Buhera Dis­trict’s flag­ship of hope – Marovany­ati Dam – whose con­struc­tion was aban­doned in 2007 due to lack of fund­ing. The de­vel­op­ment was an­nounced by the First Lady, Dr Amai Grace Mu­gabe last Fri­day as she re­sponded to a long list of in­ter­ven­tions re­quired in the drought-in­flicted dis­trict pre­sented by the Min­is­ter of State for Man­i­ca­land Provin­cial Af­fairs, Cde Mandi Chimene. Cde Chimene said Buhera was an en­tirely com­mu­nal dis­trict whose quest for growth and self-suf­fi­ciency al­ways suf­fer a deadly blend of er­ratic rains and se­vere tem­per­a­tures — mak­ing rain-fed agri­cul­ture un­ten­able. Cde Chimene had told the First Lady that pro­vi­sion of wa­ter for both do­mes­tic and agri­cul­tural pur­poses con­sti­tutes one of the great­est chal­lenges of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in Buhera — and the im­pact of in­vest­ing in wa­ter har­vest­ing and its po­ten­tial to ame­lio­rate its de­vel­op­ment and agri­cul­tural com­plex­ion could not be un­der­es­ti­mated. In re­sponse, Dr Mu­gabe said Govern­ment had availed $8m for Marovany­ati Dam con­struc­tion through the Min­istry of En­vi­ron­ment, Wa­ter and Cli­mate headed by Cde Op­pah Muchin­guri-Kashiri. “We know this area is blighted with a com­bi­na­tion of er­ratic rains and high tem­per­a­tures which makes rain fed-agri­cul­ture im­pos­si­ble. Govern­ment has al­lo­cated $8 mil­lion to­wards the con­struc­tion of Marovany­ati Dam through the Min­istry of En­vi­ron­ment, Wa­ter and Cli­mate headed by Cde Op­pah Muchin­guri-Kashiri,” said Dr Amai Mu­gabe. Cde Muchin­guri-Kashiri con­firmed the fund­ing with­out giv­ing much de­tail. Ef­forts to get an in­sight into when the project was ex­pected to kick start, since the con­trac­tor — China Jiangxi In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion, had long va­cated the site, were un­fruit­ful as Cde Muchin­guri-Kashiri was not pick­ing calls. Cde Chimene said she was also mak­ing a fol­low-up to es­tab­lish when con­struc­tion would be­gin. “Check with me next week I think the de­tails will be on my desk. I will make a fol­low up be­cause I want to see progress,” said Cde Chimene. Marovany­ati Dam is lo­cated on the Mw­er­i­hari River and its in­tended pur­pose is to pro­vide do­mes­tic, in­dus­trial wa­ter sup­ply to Mu­ram­binda and ir­ri­ga­tion of 3 650ha of agri­cul­tural land. The con­tract was awarded to China Jiangxi In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion at a con­tract price of Z$2,096,519,660.00 in Au­gust 2002 un­der TBR No. 282 and con­struc­tion com­menced in Novem­ber 2003 amid pomp and fun-fare and was ex­pected to be com­plete in 2009. The project has been mori­bund after the con­trac­tor sus­pended works with ef­fect from Novem­ber 2007 due to lack of fund­ing. The project was at 40 per­cent com­plete when work stopped. When work was sus­pended, the clear­ing of dam and spill­way foun­da­tions, soft ex­ca­va­tions of spill­way ap­proach and re­turn chan­nel, cut off ex­ca­va­tions and grout­ing, out­let works soft and hard ex­ca­va­tions had been com­pleted. A to­tal of 87m of the out­let works con­crete D-tun­nel were con­creted and 20m still re­mains. A sub­stan­tial part of the core trench was back­filled in­clud­ing the river bed sec­tion, while the hard ex­ca­va­tion of the spill­way ap­proach and re­turn chan­nel were in progress at the time of the sus­pen­sion. The crush­ing of con­crete stone ag­gre­gate was in progress before sus­pen­sion, and now gives an ugly look to the area. It will be 470 me­ters long and 30 me­ters at its deep­est, if com­plete. At least $18 mil­lion is now needed for its ex­ca­va­tion work, out­lay work and the dam wall con­struc­tion. More than 70 000 fam­i­lies near Mu­ram­binda Growth Point in Buhera are ear­marked to ben­e­fit from it ir­ri­ga­tion wise. For­mer Buhera Ru­ral Dis­trict Coun­cil head, Mr Krip­well Matsinde, re­cently im­plored Govern­ment to pri­ori­tise the project since de­mand for wa­ter has never been as great as it is to­day and the foun­da­tion of ru­ral liveli­hoods is food se­cu­rity and self-suf­fi­ciency in the dis­trict can be achieved only if all food needs are met through lo­cal sup­plies. “If we har­vest wa­ter from Marovany­ati, we will cre­ate a green belt in ar­eas like Mu­ram­binda, Tang­wena, Ga­manya, Gaza, Chi­wese, St Al­ban’s and Chik­wang­wani – which have ir­ri­ga­ble soils,” said Mr Matsinde. Agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment based on wa­ter con­ser­va­tion and ir­ri­ga­tion is of­ten con­sid­ered a promis­ing av­enue for poverty al­le­vi­a­tion in ru­ral ar­eas. “For the poor­est, an in­crease in do­mes­tic agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion is key to im­prov­ing food se­cu­rity. This ex­plains why ex­pec­ta­tions were high when the project was started. We were happy with the prospects ir­ri­gated agri­cul­ture to en­sure house­hold food se­cu­rity, as zviripi manje,” he quipped. Mr Ma­gadza, a for­mer em­ployee of Zinwa, said the avail­abil­ity of wa­ter for a small do­mes­tic gar­den plot, usu­ally man­aged by women, can make a sig­nif­i­cant dif­fer­ence to house­hold nu­tri­tion and thus con­trib­ute to im­proved liveli­hoods. The ef­fect is small scale and ir­ri­gated agri­cul­ture with its higher crop yields is ex­pected to have greater im­pact on the in­ci­dence of poverty and mal­nu­tri­tion. This ef­fect is ex­pected re­gard­less of whether the ir­ri­ga­tion project is small or large scale. How­ever, re­cent stud­ies have shown that poverty al­le­vi­a­tion as a re­sult of ir­ri­ga­tion de­vel­op­ment re­quires that the project be geared to­wards the needs of the poor. Since some vil­lagers lack sound farm­ing knowl­edge, the gap could be bridged through train­ing in the tech­ni­cal as­pects of ir­ri­ga­tion, com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tion and mar­ket­ing, ac­cess to credit, cap­i­tal or land. The con­tri­bu­tion from ir­ri­gated agri­cul­ture to achiev­ing this goal will be crit­i­cal as ir­ri­ga­tion pro­vides a pow­er­ful man­age­ment tool against the va­garies of rain­fall. Ir­ri­ga­tion also makes it eco­nom­i­cally at­trac­tive to grow high-yield­ing crops and to ap­ply the ad­e­quate plant nu­tri­tion and pest con­trol re­quired in or­der to ob­tain the full po­ten­tial of these mod­ern va­ri­eties.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190825,"BRICS hege­mony in Africa, its im­pact","AF­TER decades of US and Euro­pean Union (EU) dom­i­na­tion of global po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ar­chi­tec­ture, the bal­ance of power is shift­ing and be­ing coun­ter­bal­anced with the rise of China and other emerg­ing economies such as Rus­sia, In­dia and Brazil, who make up BRICS. The acro­nym BRICS was orig­i­nally coined in 2001 to re­fer to a group of four coun­tries: Brazil, In­dia, Rus­sia and China. Th­ese four emerg­ing economies started to meet reg­u­larly as a group in 2006. In 2010, South Africa was in­vited to join BRICS, bring­ing the to­tal mem­ber­ship to five coun­tries. The Delhi Dec­la­ra­tion, passed at the 4th BRICS sum­mit in March 2012, clearly sums up BRICS ob­jec­tives as fol­lows: “We en­vi­sion a fu­ture marked by global peace, eco­nomic and so­cial progress and en­light­ened sci­en­tific tem­per. We stand ready to work with others, de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to­gether, on the ba­sis of uni­ver­sally recog­nised norms of in­ter­na­tional law and mul­ti­lat­eral de­ci­sion-mak­ing, to deal with the chal­lenges and Top­por­tu­ni­ties be­fore the world to­day.” Ac­cord­ing to World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) statis­tics, BRICS coun­tries ac­count for 30 per­cent of global land, 43 per­cent of global pop­u­la­tion, 21 per­cent of world GDP and 45 per­cent of world’s agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. As the grip and in­flu­ence of the US and EU coun­tries is wan­ing in the glob­alised vil­lage, emerg­ing eco­nomic blocs like BRICS have gained mo­men­tum and are spread­ing their ten­ta­cles in the so-called de­vel­op­ing re­gions. Africa, given its di­ver­sity, strate­gic geo­graph­i­cal po­si­tion and abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources — in high de­mand glob­ally — is flex­ing its mus­cles and can no longer be con­sid­ered as a docile player on the global eco­nomic stage. Africa is now plac­ing con­di­tions on ex­trac­tion of its nat­u­ral re­sources and lever­ag­ing on them to ad­vance its own po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment as­pi­ra­tions as en­vi­sioned in African Union (AU) Agenda 2063, and on ro­bust eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion ini­tia­tives such as the Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (CFTA). Africa is ris­ing and mak­ing in­formed and smart choices on who it wants to do busi­ness with, and un­der what con­di­tions. African coun­tries view BRICS as a de­vel­op­ment part­ner rather than as a threat to their in­de­pen­dence and na­tional sovereignty. BRICS of­fers African coun­tries with an al­ter­na­tive — an equal part­ner­ship in eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment and less re­liance on the US and EU coun­tries. West­ern coun­tries are gen­er­ally viewed by Africans as hav­ing dou­ble stan­dards and of­ten tend to use de­vel­op­ment fi­nance, aid and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance to serve their po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­ter­ests. West­ern de­vel­op­ment aid ap­proach in Africa is now con­sid­ered as out­dated and based on per­pet­u­at­ing the colo­nial and im­pe­ri­al­is­tic donor — re­cip­i­ent — sub­servient legacy. BRICS of­fers a new way of do­ing busi­ness, a part­ner­ship and a win-win deal with Africa. Ac­cord­ing to EU 2012 Par­lia­men­tary re­port, “The role of BRICS in the De­vel­op­ing World”, BRICS mem­ber states are catalysing changes in the ar­chi­tec­ture of in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion, not only with re­gard to trade and fi­nan­cial flows, but also as donors. Over the last decade, BRICS in­creased fi­nan­cial and tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance and eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion with de­vel­op­ing coun­tries through the south-south co-op­er­a­tion. Although BRICS de­vel­op­ment aid to Africa is lower in com­par­i­son to Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD) De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Com­mit­tee (DAC) coun­tries — of­ten re­ferred to as the ma­jor donor coun­tries — it is nev­er­the­less in­creas­ing. Lack of struc­tured data of­ten makes the track­ing and quan­tifi­ca­tion of BRICS de­vel­op­ment aid dif­fi­cult to mea­sure. The EU Par­lia­men­tary re­port cited above shows that FDI in­flows from BRICS in­creased in­cred­i­bly from less than $10 bil­lion in 2002 to $146 bil­lion eight years later in 2008. In 2016, FDI in­flows from BRICS to re­cip­i­ent coun­tries were es­ti­mated at $481 bil­lion. BRICS New De­vel­op­ment Bank (NDB) — launched in 2014 in Brazil at the BRICS 6th sum­mit — seeks to mo­bilise re­sources for in­fra­struc­ture and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment projects in BRICS and other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. NDB of­fers de­vel­op­ment aid al­ter­na­tives to African coun­tries, which re­lied mostly on west­ern mul­ti­lat­eral lend­ing in­sti­tu­tions like IMF and World Bank, which are con­trolled from west­ern cap­i­tals. West­ern de­vel­op­ment aid has of­ten come with strings at­tached and un­favourable con­di­tions un­der the guise of pro­mot­ing democ­racy, hu­man rights and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. Over the last decade, BRICS coun­tries, as a bloc and in­di­vid­u­ally, have made sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions in strength­en­ing eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion and de­vel­op­ment ties with African coun­tries. BRICS strength is in its poli­cies of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, part­ner­ship, non-in­ter­fer­ence and recog­ni­tion of na­tional sovereignty of the coun­tries they di­a­logue and co-op­er­ate with. BRICS has a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment aid and views African coun­tries as “equal de­vel­op­ment part­ners”. BRICS aid projects in Africa are ne­go­ti­ated deals and de­ter­mined by the needs of the re­cip­i­ent coun­tries as op­posed to be­ing im­posed. Ac­cord­ing to Afrex­imBank (Africa) and Exim Bank (In­dia) 2018 re­port: “De­vel­op­ing South-South Col­lab­o­ra­tion: An Anal­y­sis of Africa and In­dia’s Trade and In­vest­ment”, trade be­tween Africa and In­dia is on the rise. Indo-Africa trade be­tween 2001 and 2014 in­creased ten­fold, mak­ing the Asian coun­try Africa’s fourth-largest na­tional trad­ing part­ner. Ac­cord­ing to the above re­port, In­doAfrica bi­lat­eral trade over the last 17 years rose as fol­lows: 2001($7,2 bil­lion), 2014 ($78 bil­lion) and 2017 ($55 bil­lion). Africa ac­counts for 8 per­cent of In­dia’s to­tal trade. In­dian deputy pres­i­dent Shri Venka­iah Naidu was in Zim­babwe in Novem­ber 2018 on a three-na­tion tour of Botswana, Zim­babwe and Malawi aimed at deep­en­ing In­dia’s strate­gic eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion with Africa. In­dia and Zim­babwe signed six bi­lat­eral agree­ments in ar­eas which in­clude min­ing, in­for­ma­tion ser­vices, health and ICT. In­dia also pledged a $310 mil­lion line of credit to Zim­babwe for in­fra­struc­ture re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion projects. Rus­sia has also en­tered the fray in Africa. In March 2018, Rus­sia’s For­eign Min­is­ter Sergey Lavrov un­der­took a five-day tour of African coun­tries, namely An­gola, Namibia, Mozam­bique, Zim­babwe and Ethiopia. This was viewed as mark­ing the re­turn of Rus­sia in Africa as it did not fo­cus much on de­fence deals, but on min­ing, agri­cul­ture, in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment, en­ergy and other com­mer­cial in­ter­ests. China re­mains Africa’s lead­ing trad­ing and de­vel­op­ment part­ner. China’s re­la­tions with Africa are mul­ti­fac­eted and have been boosted by the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co-op­er­a­tion (Fo­cac) and other plat­forms such as the One Belt-One Road Ini­tia­tive (OBOR) and in­sti­tu­tions such as Ex­port-Im­port Bank of China (Exim), China De­vel­op­ment Bank and China-Africa De­vel­op­ment Fund. China’s pol­icy on Africa has caused un­easi­ness in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has shown dis­dain and dis­re­spect for African coun­tries as shown by his pre­vi­ous dis­parag­ing re­marks on Africa. The US New African Strat­egy pol­icy an­nounced by Trump’s se­cu­rity ad­viser John Bolton on De­cem­ber 13 2018 at the Con­ser­va­tive Her­itage Foun­da­tion clearly shows that US in­ter­est in Africa is in se­cur­ing its se­cu­rity and eco­nomic in­ter­ests and coun­ter­ing Chi­nese in­flu­ence on the con­ti­nent. On the side­lines of the G20 Sum­mit held in Ar­gentina in De­cem­ber 2018, BRICS Heads of State is­sued a joint state­ment crit­i­cis­ing pro­tec­tion­ism amid threats by the US to in­ten­sify tar­iffs on China and im­pose more sanc­tions on Rus­sia. BRICS mem­bers urged open in­ter­na­tional trade, stress­ing that “the spirit and rules of WTO run counter to uni­lat­eral and pro­tec­tion­ist mea­sures”. BRICS con­tin­ues to in­crease its foot­print in Africa and is forg­ing strong sym­bi­otic po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ties with African coun­tries, thus herald­ing a new chap­ter in BRICS-Africa eco­nomic part­ner­ship and de­vel­op­ment co-op­er­a­tion. ◆ This ar­ti­cle, writ­ten by Allen Cho­ruma, ap­peared in the African Banker Mag­a­zine, Quar­ter 1 (Is­sue 47), 2019.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160811,It’s time G20 sup­ports Africa’s in­dus­tri­la­sa­tion agenda,"It is im­por­tant that China, through the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion ( FOCAC), is at the fore­front of supporting Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion agenda. THE G20 Sum­mit to be held in China next month is ex­pected to dis­cuss a va­ri­ety of is­sues, but ques­tions are al­ready be­ing asked if it will be of any use­ful sig­nif­i­cance to Africa. Well, the group­ing, made up of both de­vel­oped and emerg­ing economies, has in the past been crit­i­cised for its lethar­gic ap­proach on the case of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Many Africans are hop­ing that for the first time, the G20 can be­come more rel­e­vant to them by also fo­cus­ing on is­sues deal­ing with the skewed devel­op­ment tra­jec­tory of the world. This hope is pinned on China’s stance that it will push the G20 mem­bers at the meet­ing in Hangzhou City, the cap­i­tal of Zhe­jiang prov­ince, to con­sider supporting the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of Africa. This has given hope to Africans that China’s stance will have tak­ers among the lead­ers of the group which is made up of the most de­vel­oped coun­tries and a se­lected emerg­ing economies. Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Mr Wang Yi re­cently an­nounced that his coun­try will alert the de­vel­oped coun­tries at the G20 Sum­mit of Africa’s ur­gent needs. China, although much in­dus­tri­alised and the sec­ond big­gest econ­omy in the world, is still clas­si­fied as a de­vel­op­ing coun­try be­cause of its low GDP per capita, as some of its parts are still rel­a­tively poor. Stat­ing the ex­pected dis­cus­sions at the G20 Sum­mit to Chi­nese and African jour­nal­ists re­cently, Min­is­ter Wang listed his eighth point as ded­i­cated to Africa. “Africa and the least de­vel­oped coun­tries are in ur­gent need of speed­ing up the process of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and im­prov­ing self-devel­op­ment ca­pa­bil­ity,” he said. “China will pro­mote G20 mem­ber states to con­duct co­op­er­a­tion and help these coun­tries to ac­cel­er­ate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and through ca­pac­ity build­ing, in­creas­ing in­vest­ment, im­prov­ing in­fra­struc­ture and other mea­sures, so as to achieve their poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment goals.” African devel­op­ment ex­perts say given its sta­tus, China can suc­cess­fully act as a “bro­ker” to lever­age both po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic power be­tween de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. This is be­cause the Asian coun­try is the world’s sec­ond largest eco­nomic power, a po­si­tion that is cru­cial to in­flu­ence both global eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal is­sues. There is also a wide think­ing among pun­dits from Africa that time might also have come for de­vel­oped coun­tries to re­alise that skewed devel­op­ment might in fu­ture cause more prob­lems to the global econ­omy. South African-based re­searcher on African devel­op­ment Dr Tapiwa Gomo said in an in­ter­view this week that mem­bers of the G20 should draw les­sons from China’s ex­pe­ri­ence on co­op­er­a­tion with African coun­tries. “One of the les­sons is that the de­vel­oped and the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries now need each other more than ever be­fore,” he said. “This has cre­ated the need for a new eco­nomic or­der gov­erned by new rules of en­gage­ment which place the de­vel­op­ing and the de­vel­oped coun­tries at par and as equal trad­ing part­ners.” Dr Gomo said G20 mem­bers should look at ex­am­ples in African coun­tries such as Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Cote D’Ivoire, Mozam­bique and Tan­za­nia where China has strong in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture. “It is my view that these may be some of the les­sons which China wishes to share and ad­vo­cate with G20 mem­bers while emphasising that de­vel­op­ing and de­vel­oped coun­tries now need each other more than ever be­fore,” he said. “China views the sum­mit as an op­por­tu­nity to ad­vo­cate for balanced growth and global trade re­forms which should lead to a more open and un­con­di­tional global econ­omy.” Apart from de­vel­op­ing the in­fra­struc­ture, China has shown a strong in­ter­est in es­tab­lish­ing fac­to­ries in African coun­tries to help boost the man­u­fac­tur­ing base, ex­pand the econ­omy and cre­ate em­ploy­ment. The Asian eco­nomic giant has big in­fra­struc­ture pro­jects worth billions of dol­lars at var­i­ous stages of im­ple­men­ta­tion in var­i­ous African coun­tries. It is China’s prin­ci­ple of emphasising mu­tual re­spect, equal­ity in part­ner­ship and win-win co­op­er­a­tion that can serve im­por­tant les­sons to de­vel­oped coun­tries at the G20 Sum­mit. Africa has since adopted its Agenda 2063, an am­bi­tious pro­gramme to have all the 54 coun­tries on the con­ti­nent en­joy­ing some form of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion by then. It is im­por­tant that China, through the Fo­rum for China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion ( FOCAC), is at the fore­front of supporting Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion agenda. At the last FOCAC meet­ing in South Africa last year, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pledged $60 bil­lion to­wards Africa’s devel­op­ment agenda, with more fi­nan­cial re­sources ex­pected in the near fu­ture. To show its de­sire to push Africa’s case at the sum­mit, China has in­vited more African coun­tries, apart from South Africa, the only G20 mem­ber from Africa. Chad has been in­vited as the African Union chair, Sene­gal will at­tend as the chair of the New Part­ner­ship for Africa’s Devel­op­ment and Egypt will also be at the sum­mit. A man­ager at South­ern African Devel­op­ment Com­mu­nity ( SADC) Coun­cil of Non-Gov­ern­men­tal Or­gan­i­sa­tions, which is based in Botswana, Mr Ran­gari­rai Machemedze said China’s stance for the G20 Sum­mit was meant to up­lift de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Mr Machemedze fo­cused on the trade and devel­op­ment div­i­dend be­tween China and South­ern Africa in his dis­ser­ta­tion for his Masters De­gree. He noted that in SADC, lead­ers adopted the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion strat­egy and road map last year, but what is now fun­da­men­tal is to trans­form it into ac­tion­able plans. “Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion has been on the agenda of many dif­fer­ent fo­rums, in­clud­ing African Union sum­mits,” he said. “In fact, the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent is long over­due. “Hence, China’s in­vi­ta­tion (of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to the G20 Sum­mit) is not only strate­gic to giv­ing mo­men­tum to this, but is also a state­ment that the con­ti­nent has been left be­hind and this is the time to give it an op­por­tu­nity to ex­press it­self around in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is­sues. “It is also a time to give a plat­form to those that can as­sist to pro­nounce them­selves in the dif­fer­ent sec­tors.” Writ­ing on his blog, African Ca­pac­ity Build­ing Foun­da­tion ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Pro­fes­sor Emmanuel Nnadozie said the un­der rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Africa, with only one mem­ber in the G20, had dis­ad­van­tages. “It is no sur­prise then that the con­ti­nent’s pri­or­i­ties are not fully in­cor­po­rated into the G20 agenda,” he said. “Yet Africa can no longer re­main on the mar­gins where global lead­ers are mak­ing de­ci­sions on the world econ­omy. “The con­ti­nent has a duty to con­vince the group­ing to ad­dress its ma­jor con­cerns, par­tic­u­larly the strength­en­ing of pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity, in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity, value ad­di­tion and ac­cel­er­ated in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion.” The an­a­lysts note that with the help of China, Africa’s is set to be­come a per­ma­nent sub­ject of G20 meet­ings, start­ing with the Hangzhou meet­ing. So, Africans will be fol­low­ing the sum­mit with keen in­ter­est, hop­ing that other na­tions, es­pe­cially the G20 mem­bers, can draw les­sons from China’s co­op­er­a­tion with the con­ti­nent. A num­ber of meet­ings have al­ready been held in prepa­ra­tion for the sum­mit, in­clud­ing the third G20 Fi­nance Min­is­ters and Cen­tral Bank Gover­nors meet­ing in Chengdu last month and the G20 Labour and Em­ploy­ment Min­is­te­rial meet­ing in Bei­jing, also last month. The other meet­ings were the G20 En­ergy Min­is­te­rial meet­ing in Bei­jing, G20 strong sus­tain­able and balanced frame­work work­ing group meet­ing in Xi­a­men and the fourth meet­ing of G20 Green Fi­nance study group in Xi­a­men, all last month. G20 was es­tab­lished in 1999, to bring to­gether both de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to dis­cuss key is­sues in the global econ­omy.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171016,World Bank has out­lived its use­ful­ness,"THE World Bank, which re­ceives tens of bil­lions of dol­lars from the US in hard cash and guar­an­tees, has been fac­ing strong crit­i­cism in the US chal­leng­ing its ex­is­tence. In the Au­gust 10, 2017 issue of The Hill (a con­ser­va­tive Amer­i­can news­pa­per), Sher­michael Sin­gle­ton (a con­ser­va­tive po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst) wrote a dam­ag­ing piece ti­tled, “Is lib­er­al­ism the key to fight­ing global poverty? Or does it cause it?” In his con­clud­ing lines, Sin­gle­ton asked: “What will hap­pen if one pro­vides a lib­eral es­tab­lish­ment with tril­lions of dol­lars, grants it im­mu­nity from le­gal ac­count­abil­ity, and leaves it alone for three-quar­ters of a cen­tury to do good in the world?” He an­swered: “Tragedy and in­sti­tu­tion­alised racism at the ex­pense of the Amer­i­can tax­payer.” The World Bank re­sponded in the same news­pa­per to make it­self rel­e­vant, even in­dis­pens­able. The re­sponse ti­tled, “Born out of war, World Bank is bea­con of se­cu­rity around the globe” was re­veal­ing in many ways. The piece was au­thored by Wil­liam Dan­vers, the Bank’s spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive for in­ter­na­tional af­fairs. Be­fore join­ing the World Bank, Dan­vers was part of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion’s De­part­ment of State, un­der Sec­re­tary John Kerry. His piece was con­trived to con­vey an image of an in­ter­na­tional agency that was borne out of ne­ces­sity and re­mains in­dis­pens­able for the US “eco­nomic, na­tional se­cu­rity, and diplo­matic in­ter­ests and pri­or­i­ties.” He sug­gests that the US na­tional in­ter­est is as­sured by its unique ad­van­tage as “the only coun­try that pos­sesses veto power” in the World Bank. The fact that the Bank’s spe­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive for in­ter­na­tional af­fairs makes a sweep­ing state­ment that the World Bank exists to serve the US “eco­nomic, na­tional se­cu­rity, and diplo­matic in­ter­ests and pri­or­i­ties” is in­ter­est­ing in and of it­self. Equally in­ter­est­ing is the des­per­ate at­tempt to in­voke US’ veto power. The US veto power ap­plies only to one spe­cific area of the bank’s gov­er­nance — The Ar­ti­cles of Agree­ment. The US has no veto power to dic­tate the gen­eral strategy or op­er­a­tion of the World Bank. The fol­low­ing news high­lights tell the tale: “World Bank ig­nores Obama, wel­comes new Chi­nese [re­gional] bank” “World Bank chief slams US lead­er­ship on trade deal” and “World Bank will fo­cus on cli­mate change re­gard­less of Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion stance, World Bank Pres­i­dent says.” Let us move on and look closely at Dan­vers’ claim that the World Bank makes “im­por­tant, and of­ten un­no­ticed, con­tri­bu­tions to the US econ­omy.” The claim is that coun­tries “where the World Bank op­er­ates are re­spon­si­ble for cre­at­ing and sus­tain­ing mil­lions of US jobs each year.” US gov­ern­ment data shows, in 2015, US goods ex­ports to 47 Sub Sa­ha­ran African coun­tries to­talled $18.7 bil­lion (1.2 per­cent of to­tal US. goods ex­ports). Not sur­pris­ingly, Africa is not the re­gion that Dan­vers sum­moned as an al­ibi to es­tab­lish the World Bank as job gen­er­a­tor for the US ex­port in­dus­try. The mil­lions of jobs he refers to are cre­ated by US ex­ports to emerg­ing coun­tries such as China, Rus­sia, South Korea, In­dia, Brazil, and Mex­ico. None of the top 20 World Bank loan re­cip­i­ents are from Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa. The top 5 are Brazil, In­dia, Mex­ico, Indonesia, and China. Some of the loans carry no in­ter­est and come with a 5- to 10-year grace pe­riod. Ev­i­dently, the World Bank uses Africa to pan-han­dle money from US tax­pay­ers, but uses the money to sub­sidise the de­vel­op­ment ef­forts of nu­clear pow­ers such as Rus­sia, China, In­dia and Pak­istan. Dan­vers will be hard pressed to iden­tify a coun­try from Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa that has used World Bank grants and loans that can serve as a model coun­try in terms of de­vel­op­ment. The facts are that “nearly half of all chil­dren in Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa are in ex­treme poverty” and that “around a third of African coun­tries can be classed as frag­ile.” A grow­ing sense of hope­less­ness stem­ming from lack of progress has be­come can­non fod­der for in­sta­bil­ity and mass ex­o­dus of African youth. As Daily Caller re­ported in 2016, “more than 20 000 il­le­gal African im­mi­grants have en­tered Mex­ico in the past two months seek­ing to even­tu­ally get into the United States.” Even worse, as her­alded in the May 23, 2017 issue of the UK Tele­graph, “Up to 6.6 mil­lion mi­grants wait­ing to cross to Europe from Africa.” In the nir­vana land that Dan­vers paints in his ar­ti­cle, a par­tial list of the bank’s mes­sianic mis­sions in­clude: de­liv­er­ing “greater eco­nomic se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity for Amer­i­cans” . . . and tack­ling “driv­ers of con­flict and ex­trem­ism” . . . and “pro­mot­ing a safer world for all Amer­i­cans” . . . and spurring “eco­nomic growth and re­duc­ing poverty” around the world . . . and ad­vanc­ing “good gov­er­nance” and “anti-cor­rup­tion” poli­cies . . . and pro­mot­ing “dis­ease preven­tion;” etc. I am told that there is an in­side joke in the World Bank. If you want to know the va­lid­ity of a World Bank re­port count the num­ber of the word “and”. The joke turned se­ri­ous, after an Amer­i­can Pro­fes­sor Paul Romer be­came a Se­nior VP and Chief Econ­o­mist. Romer is­sued a bank-wide memo that he would not ap­prove the pub­li­ca­tion of any World Bank re­port “if the fre­quency of ‘and’ ex­ceeds 2.6 per­cent.” The 2.6 per­cent is the av­er­age in aca­demic jour­nals. The Econ­o­mist magazine re­ported that World Bank Pres­i­dent Jim Yong Kim stripped Romer of his man­age­ment con­trol be­cause of “a spat over” the word “and.” The war over the word was a proxy war over se­nior man­age­ment’s prob­lem in ar­tic­u­lat­ing the Bank’s mis­sion. As a pro­fes­sor, Romer wanted the Bank to present its mis­sion in a suc­cinct lan­guage. The ped­dlers of false mir­a­cles and bea­cons run­ning the World Bank pre­ferred to ob­fus­cate the bank’s mis­sion with a string of buzz­words stitched to­gether with “and.” In Dan­vers’ piece the word “and” ac­counts for 4.5 per­cent. If Romer had his way, Dan­vers’ laun­dry list of mir­a­cles and bea­cons would not have made it in his ar­ti­cle. Here is the painful truth, as told by Pro­fes­sor Bill East­erly, a for­mer World Bank lead re­searcher. “The West spent $2.3 tril­lion on for­eign aid over the last five decades and still had not man­aged to get $3 to each new mother to pre­vent five mil­lion child deaths.” In 2013, a re­port by Global Fi­nan­cial In­tegrity found that up to $1.4 tril­lion was si­phoned out of Africa through il­licit trans­ac­tions, over a 30-year pe­riod (1980-2009). The $1.4 fig­ure eclipsed the fi­nan­cial in­flow to Africa that was reg­is­tered over the same pe­riod. To top it off, Ra­cial dis­crim­i­na­tion in the World Bank is “sys­temic.” Blacks are “rated in­fe­rior.” They are re­garded as “not bright” and told “they can only work in the Africa re­gion.” — Black em­ploy­ees re­gard the en­vi­ron­ment as a “kind of apartheid.” This is doc­u­mented not by the bank’s crit­ics, but by the Bank’s con­fi­den­tial di­ver­sity re­ports, re­spec­tively, 1992, 1998, 2003 and 2015 It is hard to make a case for a con­tin­ued sup­port of the World Bank. Serv­ing Amer­ica’s na­tional se­cu­rity and diplo­matic in­ter­est is not per­sua­sive for the re­main­ing 189 mem­ber coun­tries of the World Bank. It is not even per­sua­sive for Amer­i­cans. A bet­ter title for Dan­vers’ piece would be “Born out of war, World Bank lacks pur­pose in time of peace.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160718,"Africa, beg­ging with a golden bowl","CHINA’s geopo­lit­i­cal pro­file has leapt from a sleep­ing gi­ant to an out­bound, re­source-hun­gry dragon with fierce ex­pan­sion­ist am­bi­tions. Western me­dia echo cham­bers rou­tinely por­tray the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion as spread­ing neo-colo­nial ten­ta­cles into the devel­op­ing world. Mean­while, Africa has not made much head­way eco­nom­i­cally, rather main­tain­ing the du­bi­ous tag of the rich­est con­ti­nent with the poor­est peo­ple. Africa con­tin­ues to play the sur­ro­gate to former colonis­ers, thanks to tech­no­log­i­cal stag­na­tions and un­fair trade deals. And now, a pre­dictable match has been in the news, lo­cat­ing Africa as the prin­ci­pal des­ti­na­tion of an ag­gres­sively charg­ing Chi­nese em­pire. Over the past decade, head­lines have re­curred about China’s al­leged land-grab­bing mis­sion in Africa, os­ten­si­bly to out­source food se­cu­rity for its one bil­lion cit­i­zens. Spec­u­la­tion about the dragon’s state-spon­sored land-grab­bing has been passed for au­thor­i­ta­tive by in­flu­en­tial, mostly Western, me­dia, schol­ars, think-thanks and even cre­ative writ­ers. Agri­cul­tur­al­ist and noted China ex­pert, Deb­o­rah Brautigam, puts the spec­u­la­tion to test in her 2015 book sim­ply ti­tled “Will Africa Feed China.” Draw­ing on ex­ten­sive field re­search in sev­eral African na­tions, Brautigam ex­plores con­ven­tional nar­ra­tives about China-Africa relations, ini­tially the claim that the Chi­nese have ac­quired large ar­eas of African farm­land. Claims that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is lead­ing this ef­fort through its sta­te­owned firms and sov­er­eign wealth funds, the Chi­nese are grow­ing grain in Africa for ex­port to China and, more sen­sa­tion­ally, the Chi­nese are send­ing large num­bers of peas­ants to set­tle on the con­ti­nent are also up for scru­tiny. “Many me­dia sto­ries have fea­tured Chi­nese com­pa­nies (or, more com­monly, sim­ply ‘China’ or ‘the Chi­nese’) as cen­tral play­ers in African land ac­qui­si­tions,” the au­thor ob­serves. “‘China . . . now has ex­ten­sive hold­ings in Africa, in­clud­ing pend­ing or at­tempted deals for mil­lions of hectares in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Zam­bia, Zim­babwe, Uganda, and Tan­za­nia, with many thou­sands of Chi­nese work­ers brought in to work on these lands,’ a reporter wrote for In­ter Press Ser­vice. “We read on an Is­raeli news web­site: ‘Chi­nese farms con­trol most of Zam­bia’s agri­cul­ture.’ CBS News pub­lished an ar­ti­cle stat­ing that ‘China re­cently pur­chased half the farm land un­der cul­ti­va­tion in the Congo,’” she notes. The im­por­tant top­ics of food se­cu­rity, land grab­bing, and the fate of small­holder farm­ers in the wake of the Asian gi­ant’s new­found in­ter­est in African vil­lages, Brautigam laments, have been com­pro­mised by in­ad­e­quacy of data. The China-Africa nar­ra­tive has suf­fered from its data-starved hype and al­lu­sive­ness to sec­ondary, some­times con­ve­niently opin­ion­ated, sources rather than on-the-ground in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Brautigam’s book seeks to de­bunk pop­u­lar myths that have fed into con­ven­tional wis­dom on the sub­ject over time, re­spond­ing with ex­ten­sive field­work and a wealth of ex­pe­ri­ence in the area e au­thor’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Chi­nese agri­cul­tural in­vest­ments in ru­ral Africa re­futes the four con­ven­tional nar­ra­tives, at least the scale and im­me­di­acy with which they are pitched in the me­dia. She points out that while a grow- ing num­ber of Chi­nese agribusi­ness com­pa­nies have pur­sued in­vest­ments in Africa, their in­ter­est has not trans­lated into sig­nif­i­cant land ac­qui­si­tions. Chi­nese-con­trolled farm­lands, she points out, are not be­ing used to ex­port food to China but to sup­ply Chi­nese food out­lets and, in some cases, to ex­port cash crops. As for the book’s gen­eral query, the au­thor sug­gests that China is ex­port­ing food to Africa, rather than the other way round, thanks to the con­ti­nent’s peren­nial tar­di­ness and de­clin­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity . Some of the in­vest­ments, which the au­thor says are much smaller or more com­pli­cated than widely hyped, are re­flec­tive of China’s de­vel­op­men­tal frame­work and gen­eral global ori­en­ta­tion but should not be at­trib­uted to state co­or­di­na­tion. The au­thor om­niv­o­rously pro­cesses files on China’s African foot­prints, separat­ing the em­pir­i­cal from the apoc­ryphal. A 2011 Voice of Amer­ica (VOA) story to the ef­fect that a Chi­nese com­pany had leased “over a quar­ter of a mil­lion acres of land in south­ern Zim­babwe for the rais­ing of maize, which it ex­ports back to China” is one of the nar­ra­tives short-cir­cuited by the book. VOA en­riched the story by an in­ter­view with an Amer­i­can pro­fes­sor and co-au­thor of the book, “Death by China”: “There are a lot of Chi­nese farm­ers there now till­ing Zim­bab­wean soil, grow­ing crops that are sent back to China while the peo­ple of Zim­babwe starve.” But, coun­ters Brautigam: “Had this been true, it might have con­firmed many of the fears about Chi­nese in­vest­ment in Africa, yet both ex­perts were sim­ply re­cir­cu­lat­ing what we might call a ‘ru­ral le­gend’ a 10-year-old ru­mour about a non-ex­is­tent Chi­nese farm.” She al­ludes, in­stead, to other prob­lems such as tense work­ing relations, dis­gruntle­ment of dis­placed peas­ants over com­pen­sa­tion terms, side-lin­ing of lo­cal labour and elu­sive ini­tia­tives. These prob­lems are dis­cussed in ephemeral fash­ion al­though they might be as im­por­tant as the fore­ground data in deter­min­ing the cen­tral con­cerns of the book. China’s sus­tained ap­petite for raw ma­te­ri­als is dis­cussed in pass­ing and its foot­prints in the con­ti­nent’s min­ing sec­tor are al­to­gether left out al­though this could be where the Asian gi­ant’s role is more clearly de­fined. To­mor­row is, how­ever, not left to its own cus­tody. The re­search is de­ployed not just to short-cir­cuit con­ven­tional nar­ra­tives but to ar­rive at a more de­fin­i­tive China-Africa fore­cast. Africa’s vastly un­der­utilised agri­cul­tural po­ten­tial is un­der spot­light in much of the book, with the con­ti­nent urged to con­sider China’s ex­am­ple of broadly mech­a­nised agri­cul­ture and strate­gic court­ing of for­eign in­vest­ment into the sec­tor. While some African coun­tries are cli­mat­i­cally suitable to grow enough and to spare, sparsely ir­ri­gated and poorly mech­a­nised farm­lands have not been per­form­ing. Only 40 per­cent of African farm­land is tech­no­log­i­cally op­ti­mal, vast swaths have not been tamed and the bulk of pro­duc­tion is sub­sis­tence-mo­ti­vated. The China-Africa re­la­tion­ship can yield other ben­e­fits be­yond aid and trade. As Zim­babwe’s former ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ter, Cde Fay Chung, says in her book, “Zim­babwe Look­ing East,” the na­tion should look to Bei­jing not for the money but pri­mar­ily for the model. “Agri­cul­tural mod­ern­iza­tion re­quires in­vest­ment. Asia’s green rev­o­lu­tion in­volved gov­ern­ment-re­search partnerships that pro­duced and dis­sem­i­nated high-yield­ing seeds, fertilizer, and other in­puts,” Brautigam says. Gov­ern­ment-di­rected im­prove­ments in Asian vil­lages, the au­thor cites a 2008 World Bank re­port, ex­plained more than 80 per­cent of ru­ral poverty re­duc­tion. This could be the case if African govern­ments move to em­power in earnest the ru­ral pop­u­la­tion which, now, is man­u­ally labouring on the soil for de­clin­ing pro­duce un­der an in­creas­ingly hos­tile cli­mate. “Gov­ern­ment and pri­vate spend­ing on re­search and de­vel­op­ment is gen­er­ally mea­gre in Africa, and a short­age of funds can mean that ex­ten­sion agents are un­able to bring even these limited re­search find­ings to the farm­ers,” the au­thor com­plains. “Ne­braska’s wheat farms and China’s rice pad­dies achieve some 80 per­cent of the yields in the gold stan­dard of con­trolled tri­als, but maize farm­ers in much of Africa are reap­ing yields only 20 to 30 per­cent of those achieved in con­trolled con­di­tions,” she says. “Will Africa Feed China” goes be­yond de­bunk­ing con­ven­tional. myths about the China-Africa re­la­tion­ship and con­sid­ers op­tions for max­imis­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity in ru­ral Africa. ◆ Stanely Mushava can be con­tacted at stane­ly­mushava@out­look.com and blogs at jit­knowl­edge.blogspot.com",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150726,Cor­rup­tion: What Zim can learn from China,"China has over the years tight­ened it’s foothold in Africa. Ev­i­dence of China’s in­volve­ment on the con­ti­nent is be­com­ing ever so ap­par­ent. From chil­dren learn­ing Man­darin in school to im­pos­ing phys­i­cal struc­tures built by the Chi­nese — the new African Union head­quar­ters be­ing a case in point. Clearly China’s in­flu­ence on Africa has been on the rise. Zim­babwe and other African coun­tries could learn a thing or two from its new found se­nior part­ner. Specif­i­cally when it comes to deal­ing with deep-rooted cor­rup­tion in many African states. An es­ti­mated $148 bil­lion is lost due to cor­rup­tion an­nu­ally in Africa, ac­cord­ing to the AU. If as lit­tle as 10% of this money were to be re­cov­ered, then ap­prox­i­mately $14,8 bil­lion could be avail­able for var­i­ous poverty re­duc­tion ini­tia­tives on the con­ti­nent. Over the years, China has had to deal with cor­rup­tion scan­dals of epic pro­por­tions that have in­volved even the most se­nior of­fi­cials of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party. This has led to Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping em­bark­ing on a mas­sive anti-cor­rup­tion and graft cam­paign, aimed at fight­ing both the “tigers and flies” re­fer­ring to both high and low-rank­ing of­fi­cials who are cor­rupt. Pres­i­dent Jin­ping’s anti-cor­rup­tion drive is not with­out ef­fect. As many as 182 000 of­fi­cials have been re­port­edly pun­ished for cor­rup­tion and abuse of power since Pres­i­dent Jin­ping came to power. China’s eight-point-plan and sev­eral other mea­sures de­vel­oped to de­ci­sively deal with cor­rup­tion, could very well be ex­actly what the doc­tor or­dered for Africa’s cor­rup­tion prob­lems. cor­rup­tion and graft in the rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party was set up to deal with in­ter­nal cor­rup­tion within the party struc­tures. Un­like many such failed ini­tia­tives by African po­lit­i­cal par­ties, the CCDI is not just a pa­per tiger. Even the once “un­touch­able” Bo Xi­lai — for­mer mem­ber of the Com­mu­nist Party’s Cen­tral Com­mit­tee Po­lit­i­cal Bureau — stood open trial on charges of tak­ing bribes, em­bez­zle­ment and abuse of power, and was sub­se­quently sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment. Such firm and res­o­lute steps to ad­dress­ing cor­rup­tion send the cor­rect sig­nals that graft and mis­man­age­ment of state re­sources will not be tol­er­ated. This would serve as a de­ter­rent for would-be of­fend­ers in gov­ern­ment. How­ever, a lack of po­lit­i­cal will to de­ci­sively root out of­fend­ers means the prob­lem con­tin­ues. Apart from the nam­ing and sham­ing of a few sac­ri­fi­cial lamps fin­gered for cor­rup­tion; al­le­ga­tions of cor­rup­tion by gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials have gen­er­ally fiz­zled out with lit­tle or no con­vic­tions of the cul­prits in Africa. Bold steps need to be taken if the scourge of cor­rup­tion is to be dealt with. For in­stance, a pi­lot pro­gramme launched by China’s po­lit­i­cal watchdog makes it manda­tory for all newly pro­moted of­fi­cials to dis­close their spouses’ and chil­dren’s em­ploy­ment sta­tuses, as­sets owned as well as in­ter­na­tional travel records. This could be an ef­fec­tive way of en­sur­ing trans­parency and en­gen­der­ing ac­count­abil­ity in gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, as they would have to ac­count for any large and un­jus­ti­fied ac­cu­mu­la­tion of wealth while they oc­cupy po­si­tions of in­flu­ence. The Chi­nese have also ex­celled at do­ing away with ex­trav­a­gance and he­do­nism that en­cour­ages a mis­placed sense of en­ti­tle­ment. Of­ten, the rul­ing of­fi­cials splurge riches on them­selves with im­punity as they lead op­u­lent lifestyles sup­ported by state cof­fers. In China how­ever, the winds have been shift­ing. While for years, the doc­trine of “let­ting some peo­ple get rich first” pushed by com­mu­nist leader Deng Xiaop­ing had fos­tered this ex­trav­a­gant and grandiose cul­ture by top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials; fru­gal­ity and thrift now dom­i­nate the po­lit­i­cal land­scape. China’s party lead­er­ship has now banned such trin­kets as flower ar­range­ments for of­fi­cials in meet­ing rooms and ho­tels as well as other lux­u­ri­ous gifts dur­ing fes­ti­vals. Ad­di­tion­ally, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials now have caps on daily spend­ing when trav­el­ling around the coun­try. Per­haps more wor­ry­ing is the heavy-handed role that the mil­i­tary plays in most African states. Mil­i­tary inspired coups and a pa­tron­age brand of pol­i­tics by mil­i­tary per­son­nel are preva­lent across the con­ti­nent. This huge in­volve­ment by the mil­i­tary could well be a po­ten­tial av­enue for army of­fi­cials to en­gage in cor­rup­tion. As anti-cor­rup­tion ini­tia­tives gain more promi­nence in China, the mil­i­tary has also not been spared. Is­sues around prop­erty own­er­ship, use of of­fi­cial ve­hi­cles and the hir­ing of ser­vice per­son­nel are now com­ing to the fore. As a case in point, the Chi­nese mil­i­tary has been banned from buy­ing for­eign-made ve­hi­cles. An in­ter­est­ing ob­ser­va­tion made in China was that at least 99% of the vi­o­la­tions in­volv­ing graft were com­mit­ted by pre­fec­ture or town­ship level of­fi­cials. This is not pe­cu­liar to China alone, how­ever. Con­ti­nen­tal heavy­weights like Nige­ria, Kenya and South Africa have also wit­nessed cor­rup­tion at low lev­els of gov­ern­ment by par­lia­men­tar­i­ans or coun­cil of­fi­cials. It is then at these grass­roots struc­tures that cor­rup­tion must be nipped in the bud. More im­por­tantly, the Chi­nese fight against cor­rup­tion has at­tracted the in­volve­ment of the top lead­ers. The top rungs of lead­er­ship, with Pres­i­dent Jin­ping at the fore­front, have been con­sis­tent in their anti-cor­rup­tion mes­sage and not merely po­lit­i­cal rhetoric. This is def­i­nitely some­thing that is needed in Africa as part of ef­forts to con­front cor­rup­tion. A com­mon Chi­nese prac­tice of “Guan Xi”— re­lated gift giv­ing — pre­vi­ously seen as a way of build­ing re­la­tion­ships and con­nec­tions bas­ing on those gifts — has for long been viewed as a form of cor­rup­tion, es­pe­cially by for­eign­ers. As the crack­down on cor­rup­tion con­tin­ues, of­fi­cials are be­com­ing more cir­cum­spect in their in­volve­ment in such prac­tices. This is one of the many ex­am­ples of how the di­rect ap­proach taken by the Chi­nese to root out cor­rup­tion is slowly per­me­at­ing into Chi­nese cul­ture. These pre­scrip­tive mea­sures on deal­ing with cor­rup­tion from a Chi­nese per­spec­tive can be highly ef­fec­tive if they are im­ple­mented in Africa. Some re­ports even sug­gest the crack­down on cor­rup­tion in China has been weigh­ing down growth in the Asian gi­ant’s econ­omy as con­spic­u­ous spend­ing by top of­fi­cials dips. This how­ever is an ar­gu­ment for another day. What’s needed now is an ef­fec­tive way of root­ing out cor­rup­tion and graft, par­tic­u­larly that of top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in Africa. Should African pol­i­cy­mak­ers be se­ri­ous about cor­rup­tion, then China’s eight-point mea­sures on cor­rup­tion might very well be the an­ti­dote to Africa’s cor­rup­tion prob­lems.",津巴布韦

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20151206,Keep China even closer,"HE DID not mean it in scenic ref­er­ence, as many who pass by the Kopje in Harare would right­fully de­duce him as fool­ish. Fried­man meant that with in­creased glob­al­i­sa­tion, the world has be­come much more of a level play­ing field in terms of op­por­tu­ni­ties. The no­tion may be a bit ex­ag­ger­ated as there are ex­ist­ing struc­tural im­ped­i­ments that re­main un­evenly ap­por­tioned to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries; notwith­stand­ing for the dili­gent na­tion, mod­ern global com­merce of­fers un­prece­dented pos­si­bil­i­ties! China is one such dili­gent na­tion. On re­cent record, it is ar­guably the best of those. Ever since an ide­o­log­i­cal shift that sort to open China to the rest of the world, no other coun­try has ex­pe­ri­enced sim­i­lar eco­nomic growth. It is then great for­tune that Zim­babwe has been able to form a cor­dial re­la­tion­ship, bet­ter yet, formed a kin­dred at­tach­ment with China in cer­tain worldly out­looks. In our close in­ter­ac­tions with China, we must take the op­por­tu­nity to as­sim­i­late de­sir­able per­spec­tives that have driven its wildly suc­cess­ful eco­nomic strat­egy. We must in­quire the kind of mind­set and in­cli­na­tions re­spon­si­ble for China’s eco­nomic tra­jec­tory. The fore­most virtue we can adopt is that a coun­try’s fate is de­ter­mined from the ex­cel­lence it de­vel­ops from within. To ad­vance eco­nom­i­cally, Zim­babwe must be sys­tem­i­cally dis­ci­plined and func­tion­ally well-struc­tured. China took these steps by en­gag­ing in a war on cor­rup­tion! A coun­try has to de­cide on a means of eco­nomic man­age­ment which must sys­tem­i­cally func­tion. China chose a form of state cap­i­tal­ism and it un­der­stood that for the sys­tem to be a suc­cess, it must be clean! Cor­rup­tion, for any cho­sen form of eco­nomic man­age­ment, is in­tol­er­a­ble! In China’s per­spec­tive, cor­rup­tion is a car­di­nal sin and treach­er­ous to the as­pi­ra­tions of eco­nomic progress. Thus, within its gov­er­nance struc­tures, China has groomed what is al­most vile dis­dain and shame to­wards cor­rup­tion. China re­tains an un­der­stand­ing which we do not have - that when cor­rup­tion be­comes sys­temic it is cul­pa­ble of cre­at­ing poverty, hunger, un­con­trolled dis­ease, and so­cial mis­ery! This strong per­cep­tion to­wards cor­rup­tion is piv­otal for the ex­cel­lence of China’s eco­nomic man­age­ment. Zim­babwe should make it a pri­or­ity to in­cul­cate this un­der­stand­ing of cor­rup­tion be­cause the sys­tem will never work with cor­rup­tion. We must per­ceive the sys­temic con­se­quences of cor­rup­tion in the same way that the Chi­nese do. Sec­ondly, which­ever form of eco­nomic man­age­ment we de­cide on, it must be a work­able sys­tem with at­tain­able re­sults. Zim­babwe has pro­longed refu­ta­tive eco­nomic nar­ra­tives, whilst spend­ing lit­tle time form­ing strat­egy for a cus­tomised eco­nomic sys­tem that at­tends to our as­pi­ra­tions. This is not to down­play the need to re­buke worldly in­jus­tice and inequitable ex­change. How­ever, we have al­most groomed a cul­ture where we ap­plaud those who ar­tic­u­late what we should not like, yet they of­fer no crys­tallised eco­nomic sys­tem that func­tions to­wards what we do like! China has al­ways been con­scious of in­equities in the global eco­nomic ar­chi­tec­ture. Through en­hanced eco­nomic ap­ti­tude, how­ever, to­day China is the global cred­i­tor of choice. More im­pres­sively, the IMF has just de­cided to make the Rem­nibi an SDR cur­rency. This is all whilst China is fight­ing in con­spic­u­ous mone­tary ag­gres­sion from the US, un­fairly pres­sur­ing the over val­u­a­tion of the Chi­nese cur­rency. What re­mains un­said is that the main cause of Ja­pan’s two decade long stag­na­tion is its cur­rency ap­pre­ci­a­tion, of which it had no choice but to main­tain it due to trade re­tal­i­a­tion threats by the US if the Yen weak­ened. The Chi­nese have been vic­tim to sim­i­lar on­slaught, yet with­out groom­ing politi­cians of de­fi­ant pos­ture, or ones who re­gur­gi­tate refu­ta­tive nar­ra­tives, China sort af­ter the eco­nomic ap­ti­tude to bring about tan­gi­bly vic­tory. Thirdly, the Chi­nese say “when you lose con­trol of the ten­sion be­tween pur­su­ing method­ol­ogy and ques­tion­ing it, then you’ve lost com­mit­ment and in­stead have be­come fun­da­men­tal­ist”. While it is com­mend­able that we have been un­wa­ver­ing in pur­su­ing our em­pow­er­ment ethos, we can learn from how the Chi­nese take great care in eval­u­at­ing progress of im­ple­men­ta­tion. Land re­form is over a decade old, yet it has taken the bold aware­ness of Dr Amai Mu­gabe to open dis­course on the need to more eq­ui­tably al­lo­cate land amongst our­selves. Many who have been in po­si­tions of in­flu­ence have lost the im­pas­sioned drive for fair land dis­tri­bu­tion as they ac­cu­mu­lated huge tracts of land and in­puts for them­selves. Thus 15 years on, what is our eval­u­a­tion of the land re­form process? For al­most six years now, the Min­istry of Youth, In­di­geni­sa­tion, and Eco­nomic Em­pow­er­ment has been fine-tun­ing in­di­geni­sa­tion laws. It has be­come a process that seems unique to Zim­babwe and a source of mys­tery on how to ef­fec­tively ex­e­cute such leg­is­la­tion. Yet many coun­tries have done it be­fore, and nu­mer­ous oth­ers that be­gan af­ter us are re­al­is­ing div­i­dends be­fore us! China fol­lows five year plans which are guided by the suc­cess of im­ple­men­ta­tion, con­sis­tently con­duct­ing metic­u­lous as­sess­ment of the process. Zim­babwe has not had sim­i­lar tenac­ity to im­prove our pro­cesses, let alone hav­ing the brav­ery to ques­tion whether they are ef­fec­tive or not. A bonus con­sid­er­a­tion is on our at­ti­tudes to­wards the emerg­ing global su­per power that is China. It would be disin­gen­u­ous to over­look that some stake­hold­ers in our econ­omy and so­ci­ety have been skep­ti­cal of Chi­nese in­ten­tions for Zim­babwe in the long term, es­pe­cially de­mand­ing greater trans­parency of the con­di­tions un­der­writ­ing our eco­nomic deal­ings. It is easy to la­bel them as de­trac­tors and pes­simists. How­ever, these con­cerns are well jus­ti­fied and at the very least un­der­stand­able, though they are not prop­erly ex­plained. The skep­ti­cism is two-fold. Firstly, we are not yet proven deal-mak­ers as many prior projects have fre­quently stalled or strug­gled to bring about the broad eco­nomic ben­e­fit that we may have hoped for. Sec­ondly and more im­por­tantly, the skep­ti­cism is more a re­flec­tion of our own ex­pe­ri­ences deal­ing with for­eign­ers than it is an as­sess­ment of any ev­i­dent mal-treat­ment from our Chi­nese coun­ter­parts. Just like the rest Africa, our ex­pe­ri­ence with global su­per pow­ers has been economics of ex­trac­tion and po­lit­i­cal es­pi­onage, both serv­ing for­eign in­ter­ests. Per­haps it is un­pleas­ant to say, but by now those in­jus­tices should be ac­cepted as fact. In­ter­est­ingly, how­ever, to para­phrase former US Sec­re­tary of Trea­sury Larry Sum­mers, who re­cently noted that while China is be­com­ing the lat­est global su­per­power, the world lacks shared un­der­stand­ing re­gard­ing goals for the evo­lu­tion of the Chi­nese econ­omy. “Clar­ity is re­quired on whether China’s quest to suc­ceed eco­nom­i­cally will sup­port global pros­per­ity and be a driver of pos­i­tive so­cial and po­lit­i­cal progress. To solve these ten­sions, di­a­logue must be shared on the short and long-term in­ter­ests of this emerg­ing su­per power.” For Zim­babwe, I would sug­gest greater cul­tural in­ter­ac­tion and un­der­stand­ing of Chi­nese ide­ol­ogy and as­pi­ra­tions be­yond our diplo­matic struc­tures. While po­lit­i­cal ca­ma­raderie and en­gage­ment may have tan­gi­ble ben­e­fit, cul­tural and so­cio-eco­nomic in­ter­ac­tions will de­velop mu­tual sen­ti­ment of co­op­er­a­tion and trust. I hope that as a na­tion we can agree that friend­ship with one is not a mea­sure­ment to our friend­ship with oth­ers, granted al­le­giances do mat­ter in po­lit­i­cal econ­omy. While we should keep China even closer and share per­spec­tives that lead to eco­nomic pros­per­ity, Zim­babwe must still seek worth­while friend­ships from all over the world.",津巴布韦

This could hold the United King­dom to­gether and deny the Ir­ish Repub­li­cans the op­por­tu­ni­ties for smug­gling on a mas­sive scale. It would also pre­serve the UK as a key ser­vices hub and set­tle global mar­kets. But it would not deal with the fu­ture of the ACP or the com­mon­wealth. The com­mon­wealth is not a min­now – it con­tains a third of the world’s pop­u­la­tion and a quar­ter of global GDP. It speaks a com­mon lan­guage – the lan­guage of science and technology and the lan­guage of trade. It shares a com­mon­al­ity in terms of its le­gal sys­tems and al­ready has close po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ties. The world to­day is quite dif­fer­ent to what it was in the mid 20th Cen­tury. Global trade, in­te­grated fi­nan­cial sys­tems and di­min­ished poverty levels have made it es­sen­tial for in­di­vid­ual coun­tries to have sound work­ing re­la­tions with oth­ers. So the China of to­day is not only an in­creas­ingly open so­ci­ety and econ­omy but its for­eign poli­cies seek friend­ship and co­op­er­a­tion with all other States. The con­se­quence of these changes in China has been dra­matic and has shown the world what a coun­try can do if it plays this new game to its own ad­van­tage. In the process China has helped lift the world econ­omy onto a new plane and car­ried with it, the coun­tries of the Far East. Is it pos­si­ble for the Com­mon­wealth to move back onto the cen­tre stage of world his­tory as a re­sult of Brexit? What if the Com­mon­wealth lead­ers de­cided to cre­ate a new global al­liance of States with a com­mon his­tory and po­lit­i­cal cul­ture? It could in the process in­vite all smaller states, as has hap­pened in Africa, to join this new group­ing and adopt free trade and fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion strate­gies to foster growth and de­vel­op­ment. In this way the Com­mon­wealth could ne­go­ti­ate at in­ter­na­tional fo­rums as a block of states with real power and in­flu­ence. Much has been said about the Bricks al­liance but this is not gain­ing any sort of mo­men­tum and with South Africa and Brazil in trou­ble, may not be­come what they in­tended. The other ad­van­tage of the Com­mon­wealth as an or­gan­i­sa­tion seek­ing mu­tual ad­van­tages and de­vel­op­ment; would be its truly global reach.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20210106,‘Boost pro­duc­tion to take ad­van­tage of AfCFTA’,"MANY African coun­tries — in­clud­ing Zim­babwe — have pinned their hopes for eco­nomic re­vival on the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agree­ment that came into force on Jan­uary 1, 2021. The AfCFTA — which was ini­tially set to com­mence on July 1, 2020 but de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus — seeks to boost in­tra-Africa trade. As of De­cem­ber 2020, 54 coun­tries had signed the agree­ment, while 34 coun­tries have de­posited their in­stru­ments of rat­i­fi­ca­tion, ac­cord­ing to Wamkele Mene, the AfCFTA sec­re­tary gen­eral. If im­ple­mented fully, the trade pact could boost re­gional in­come by 7 per­cent or US$450 bil­lion, speed up wage growth for women, and lift 30 mil­lion peo­ple out of ex­treme poverty by 2035, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank. A re­port from the World Bank shows that Zim­babwe and Côte d’Ivoire — where trade costs are among the con­ti­nent’s high­est — would see the big­gest gains of the AfCFTA, with each in­creas­ing in­come by 14 per­cent. But econ­o­mists ar­gue Zim­babwe needs to put its house in or­der first for it to ben­e­fit. Zim­babwe used to have a ro­bust man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which would have put it first in the queue of coun­tries that could ben­e­fit from the AfCFTA. Decades of mis­man­age­ment, how­ever, have cre­ated an econ­omy of im­porters rather than pro­duc­ers. The South­ern African coun­try re­lies on im­ports of nearly ev­ery­thing from fur­ni­ture, chem­i­cals, cloth­ing to even tooth­picks from its neigh­bour­ing coun­try South Africa and China. Lack of pro­duc­tiv­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness Mr Pros­per Chi­ta­m­bara, an econ­o­mist in Harare, says that Zim­babwe will not im­me­di­ately ben­e­fit from the trade pact. “We have low ca­pac­ity in all key sec­tors of the econ­omy and in par­tic­u­lar the agri­cul­tural and the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors. (Our) com­pet­i­tive­ness and pro­duc­tiv­ity gap is huge and this ren­ders us in­ca­pable of com­pet­ing with the rest of the African na­tions,” he says. He adds that the coun­try needs to strengthen the in­dus­trial sec­tor and ad­dress chal­lenges in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. “We need to in­crease in­vest­ment in crit­i­cal pro­duc­tiv­ity en­hance­ment sec­tors like in in­fra­struc­ture and in par­tic­u­lar ir­ri­ga­tion, as well as trans­port and en­ergy in­fra­struc­ture. Th­ese are the key en­ablers to un­lock value within agri­cul­ture, in­dus­try and the rest of the econ­omy,” mr Chi­ta­m­bara ex­plains. Econ­o­mist Mr Vic­tor Bhoroma says Zim­babwe’s ex­ports are mostly raw ma­te­ri­als and that lo­cal in­dus­tries are not com­pet­i­tive re­gion­ally. Man­u­fac­tur­ing’s dis­con­tents “Zim­babwe’s low man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion means that lo­cal in­dus­tries can­not com­pete with re­gional peers such as those from Zam­bia, South Africa, An­gola and Namibia that have en­joyed longer pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic and cur­rency sta­bil­ity, and pol­icy con­sis­tency,” he ex­plains. Mr Bhoroma says the ma­jor set­backs for Zim­babwe to ben­e­fit from the trade pact in­clude low in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion, high cost of do­ing busi­ness and com­plex tax­a­tion pro­ce­dures, pol­icy in­con­sis­tency — es­pe­cially on mone­tary re­forms — in­ef­fi­cient for­eign ex­change poli­cies and por­ous bor­ders that make it hard to pre­vent smug­gling. “(There is need to) im­ple­ment a mar­ket de­ter­mined man­aged float ex­change rate to re­move ar­bi­trage op­por­tu­ni­ties that threaten pri­mary pro­duc­tion lo­cally in favour of im­port­ing fin­ished prod­ucts,” he says. “Mone­tary pol­icy con­sis­tency is key to sta­ble pro­duc­tion and ex­port ca­pac­ity.” Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ZNCC) pres­i­dent Mr Ti­nashe Manzungu says for lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of trade to bear fruit, African states must over­come the trade con­straints. “Th­ese sup­ply con­straints in­clude weak in­fra­struc­ture (and) time con­sumed pro­ce­dures at cus­toms bor­ders,” he ex­plains. Cre­at­ing op­por­tu­nity The AfCFTA of­fers Zim­babwe’s an op­por­tu­nity to re­cover from the eco­nomic tur­moil caused by the coro­n­avirus. Zim­babwe’s econ­omy shrank by more than 6 per­cent in 2019. Mr Manzungu says that while the global econ­omy is in tur­moil due to the Covid-19, the cre­ation of a vast re­gional mar­ket will help Zim­babwe di­ver­sify its ex­ports, ac­cel­er­ate growth and at­tract for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe In­dus­tries pres­i­dent Mr Henry Ruzvidzo says the AfCFTA will en­cour­age in­ter-Africa trade, which is low at the mo­ment. “We have the op­por­tu­nity to lever­age on our lo­ca­tion, re­source en­dow­ments and con­sid­er­able man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and know-how to get a head start in the race,” he says. Ms Con­stance Chemwayi, a min­istry of for­eign af­fairs and in­ter­na­tional trade spokesperson, tells The Africa Re­port that Zim­babwe is pre­par­ing tar­iff of­fers to sub­mit to the AfCFTA sec­re­tariat in or­der to op­er­a­tionalise the trade pact. She said th­ese will show the pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs to be ap­plied on im­ports com­ing from the con­ti­nent, with the aim of even­tu­ally elim­i­nat­ing the tar­iffs. Tar­iff prepa­ra­tions Ms Chemwayi says that once Zim­babwe sub­mits the tar­iff of­fers and they are sub­se­quently gazetted, the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits in­clude ac­cess to ex­port and im­port mar­kets at re­duced pref­er­en­tial cus­toms du­ties for prod­ucts with agreed rules of ori­gin from the con­ti­nent. “The pref­er­en­tial du­ties will be favourable as com­pared to the most-favoured-na­tion du­ties, which are payable by coun­tries not party to the AfCFTA,” she adds. While there is a need to boost lo­cal in­dus­tries so that we can fully ben­e­fit from the agree­ment, the Gov­ern­ment is work­ing to cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for busi­ness to take ad­van­tage of the AfCFTA.” -The Africa Re­port.",津巴布韦

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20170514,De­pen­dence is hold­ing Africa back,"THERE are a lot of con­trived sta­tis­tics and re­search that seek to cast Africa as an economic back­wa­ter, a con­ti­nent that re­mains stub­bornly mired in poverty. Well, while this might be un­der­stand­able, it is def­i­nitely not jus­ti­fi­able. The New York-head­quar­tered Global Fi­nance Magazine, for ex­am­ple, claims that 19 out of the 23 poor­est coun­tries in the world are found in Africa. Whilst it might be fash­ion­able to say this – ac­cept­able, even, in some quar­ters – the in­dices that are used to come up with such con­clu­sions have to be sub­jected to em­pir­i­cal tests and scru­tiny. To a greater ex­tent, such an out­come might be pos­si­ble through us­ing the hu­man de­vel­op­ment in­dex, but in terms of re­sources per capita – the to­tal value of pre­cious re­sources visa-vis the pop­u­la­tion – African coun­tries can be counted among the rich­est. One trait that con­tin­ues to taint the im­age of African coun­tries is over-re­liance on for­eign aid. For a con­ti­nent that is richly en­dowed with nat­u­ral min­eral re­sources, it is in­con­ceiv­able how it re­mains trapped in a vi­cious cir­cle where it re­mains a pre­dom­i­nant sup­plier of raw ma­te­ri­als on the one hand and a big con­sumer of fin­ished prod­ucts on the other. Africa is now not only beg­ging from the West but from the East as well, es­pe­cially af­ter the rise of China in the past three decades. Money from rich coun­tries has trapped many African na­tions in a cy­cle of cor­rup­tion, slower economic growth and poverty. Cut­ting off the flow would be far more ben­e­fi­cial. African coun­tries, how­ever, are in­creas­ingly work­ing to­wards un­learn­ing the cul­ture of beg­ging, and push­ing to­wards self-sus­te­nance. This is the mes­sage that Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe has been preach­ing in the re­gion and be­yond. But, most im­por­tantly, the over­rid­ing nar­ra­tive that is be­ing pro­moted in most coun­tries is that of growth with eq­uity. And the economic well-be­ing of coun­tries should be mea­sured in this way. Some ar­gue that the economies of African coun­tries were fairly ro­bust dur­ing the colo­nial era. How­ever, such ref­er­ences only con­sid­ered the well-be­ing of the mi­nor­ity whites who were the agen­cies of colo­nial­ism. It is im­por­tant to note that dur­ing th­ese sup­pos­edly golden economic times, blacks re­mained in des­per­ate cir­cum­stances. Clearly, the aim of colo­nial­ism was, and still is, to ex­ploit the phys­i­cal, hu­man, and economic re­sources of an area to ben­e­fit the coloniser. But by bind­ing the economic con­di­tions and cir­cum­stances of African coun­tries to im­pe­rial pow­ers, an in­sep­a­ra­ble link was cre­ated. It is this link that still makes African coun­tries bound and de­pen­dent on their erst­while colonis­ers. Un­for­tu­nately, this syn­drome con­tin­ues to shape the opin­ion of those who think for­eign aid is key to the re­vival of the local economy. Why does a coun­try that has so much fer­tile land and nat­u­ral re­sources have to rely on beg­ging? We only need to ap­ply our minds cor­rectly. Hap­pily, vi­sion­ary African lead­ers are be­gin­ning to ag­gres­sively chart a new way for­ward for the con­ti­nent. The gospel of self-re­liance is grad­u­ally tak­ing hold. De­vel­op­ment is borne out of a pos­i­tive psy­che. It seems the great­est chal­lenge that African youth have is to re­set the cur­rent mind­set and strive to com­pete in the world. It is not only de­pen­dence on aid that needs to be shunned, but de­pen­dence on free­bies as well as this nat­u­rally erodes en­ter­prise. The high de­fault rate on the well-mean­ing Youth Fund that was ar­ranged by Gov­ern­ment with the help of Old Mu­tual is quite wor­ry­ing. The per­cep­tion that Gov­ern­ment funds are for free has to be changed. En­cour­ag­ingly, there are a lot of suc­cess­ful young en­trepreneurs who never got any loans from any­one but are do­ing so well in busi­ness. The chal­lenge that re­mains is to grow the economy and pro­mote poli­cies that are favourable to economic growth. Local busi­nesses need to be given space to grow. And this is ex­actly what Gov­ern­ment seems to be do­ing. The cur­rent rhetoric only needs to be trans­lated into real ac­tion on the ground. It is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of Zim­bab­weans to see Zim­babwe grow and the re­spon­si­bil­ity of Africans to see Africa grow. Amer­i­cans will work for Amer­ica, Chi­nese will work for China and hence Zim­bab­weans should work for Zim­babwe. It must be noted that what­ever th­ese na­tion­al­i­ties do, they al­ways re­mit back to their coun­tries. It is high time we stop beg­ging and start work­ing.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170406,Vic­to­ria Falls: A tourism phoenix set to rise,"THE state-of-the-art Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port, built by a Chi­nese firm, is al­ready prov­ing its po­ten­tial as a pre­mier des­ti­na­tion for air­lines from var­i­ous coun­tries. The air­port was built by China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional Eco­nomic and Tech­ni­cal Co­op­er­a­tion Group and com­mis­sioned by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe in Novem­ber last year. While it is im­por­tant that the newlook air­port is a sym­bol of the progress be­ing made in Zim­babwe, it sig­nif­i­cantly rep­re­sents the pro­gres­sive re­la­tions be­tween the coun­try and China. It is a sam­ple of what can be achieved in other ar­eas of Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic re­vival, as the Asian eco­nomic gi­ant has since in­di­cated its will­ing­ness to help the coun­try in all as­pects. Well, the good eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal re­la­tions be­tween China and Zim­babwe can­not be in doubt, as they have been well rooted in mu­tual trust and win-win co­op­er­a­tion. What is now crit­i­cal is to take th­ese re­la­tions for­ward and make them start ben­e­fit­ing peo­ple from both sides. And there is no doubt that es­tab­lish­ments such as the Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port will help bring the ben­e­fits to the grass­roots. A few months af­ter its com­mis­sion­ing, in­ter­na­tional air­lines are al­ready stam­ped­ing to land at the air­port. The end re­sult is that more tourists will even­tu­ally flock to Vic­to­ria Falls from all over the world, as the new air­port can now ac­com­mo­date planes of dif­fer­ent sizes and shapes. Ethiopian Air­lines has al­ready started fly­ing di­rectly to Vic­to­ria Falls from Ad­dis Ababa en-route to Gaborone, Botswana, while South African Air­ways has un­veiled a big­ger plane, an Air­bus A330200, for the route. Kenyan Air­ways, Emi­rates, Qatar and RwandAir have also an­nounced they will be fly­ing di­rectly to Vic­to­ria Falls. Eti­had has a code share with Bri­tish Air­ways to fly to the world ac­claimed tourism des­ti­na­tion, while Lufthansa has a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment with South African Air­ways. This is in ad­di­tion to other air­lines that have been fly­ing to the pre­mier tourist des­ti­na­tion like Bri­tish Air­ways, South African Air­ways, ComAir, Air Namibia and Air Zim­babwe. For many years, the Vic­to­ria Falls has been touted as crit­i­cal to Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic turn­around, but its po­ten­tial has been sup­pressed. Now, the prover­bial “phoenix” is set to rise, thanks to the Chi­nese firm for re­con­struct­ing the air­port to in­ter­na­tional stan­dards. There is no doubt that China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional did an ex­cep­tional job and man­aged to ex­hibit well the spirit that char­ac­terises China’s rise from poverty a few years ago to a mod­er­ately rich so­ci­ety. The con­struc­tion and re­fur­bish­ment of the air­port was made pos­si­ble by a $150 mil­lion con­ces­sional loan fa­cil­ity pro­vided to Zim­babwe by the China Ex­port and Im­port Bank in 2012. The civil engi­neer­ing works be­gan in 2013, re­sult­ing in the con­struc­tion of a new four-kilo­me­tre long and 60 me­tres wide run­way, an in­ter­na­tional ter­mi­nal build­ing, a fire sta­tion, con­trol tower and in­stalling of state-of-the-art spe­cial­ist avi­a­tion equip­ment. The old air­port was also ren­o­vated and will now serve as the do­mes­tic ter­mi­nal build­ing. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe was so im­pressed by the work done by China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional, which he said would en­hance co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Zim­babwe and China. “China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional, the Chi­nese con­trac­tor en­gaged on this pro­ject, met our re­quire­ments,” he said while com­mis­sion­ing the new air­port. “We com­mend them for the pro­fes­sional and ef­fi­cient way they worked on this pro­ject and we will not hes­i­tate to en­gage them again, should other projects arise.” By work­ing on Vic­to­ria Falls air­port, China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional has en­sured that air trans­port plays a ma­jor role, not only in Zim­babwe, but in the whole of SADC re­gion in trade and tourism. This is ex­pected to foster re­gional in­te­gra­tion. The ex­pan­sion of Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port has greatly im­proved the equip­ment and fa­cil­i­ties, as well as the ca­pa­bil­ity of safe­guard­ing civil avi­a­tion se­cu­rity. Re­cep­tion of in­ter­na­tional tourists is now ex­pected to in­crease from 500 000 peo­ple per year to nearly two mil­lion peo­ple fol­low­ing the new con­struc­tion and ren­o­va­tion. Tourism is one of the top for­eign cur­rency earn­ers in Zim­babwe and the en­vis­aged in­crease in tourist ar­rivals fol­low­ing the ex­pan­sion of the air­port will boost the coun­try’s re­serves. It is also ex­pected that the rapid de­vel­op­ment of tourism in Vic­to­ria Falls will drive up the ter­tiary in­dus­try, in­clud­ing trans­porta­tion, post and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, real es­tate, busi­ness, in­sur­ance, cul­ture and en­ter­tain­ment. Apart from that, the ex­pan­sion of the air­port also brings jobs to lo­cal peo­ple, horns the skills of Zim­bab­wean tech­ni­cians, teaches Chi­nese big time con­struc­tion tech­niques and man­age­ment and helps pro­mote the con­struc­tion in­dus­try in the coun­try. Jiangsu prov­ince, which owns China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional, has in­vested in five projects in Zim­babwe, with the con­tracted in­vest­ment stand­ing at $44,21 mil­lion, among which four were car­ried out af­ter 2011. Th­ese projects in­volve the iron and steel met­al­lurgy, agri­cul­ture and con­struc­tion and in­stal­la­tion. In 2015, Jiangsu’s trade vol­ume with Zim­babwe to­taled $56,39 mil­lion, up by 18,4 per­cent from a year ear­lier. Of this to­tal vol­ume, $53,80 mil­lion was from Jiangsu’s ex­port to Zim­babwe, up by 72,8 per­cent, $2,59 mil­lion im­port, down by 84,3 per­cent. In South­ern Africa, Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port is now re­garded as a mod­ern air­port, for all its tech­ni­cal and ap­pli­ca­tion di­men­sions have reached high stan­dards of to­day’s in­ter­na­tional civil avi­a­tion ser­vices. But is im­por­tant that in such fu­ture projects with the Chi­nese, the Zim­bab­wean Gov­ern­ment looks at con­cerns that can de­rail progress. Th­ese in­clude ob­ser­va­tions by China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional that the Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port was haunted by high trans­port cost of im­ported cargo, slow and com­pli­cated cus­toms clear­ance and cum­ber­some pro­ce­dure of cer­ti­fi­ca­tion. Ac­cord­ing to the firm, there was also slow ap­proval of de­sign­ing and con­struc­tion draw­ings, short­age of lo­cal sup­ply of ma­jor con­struc­tion ma­te­ri­als like ce­ment, gravel and fuel oil in par­tic­u­lar, fre­quent power and wa­ter fail­ure and lack of qual­i­fied tech­ni­cal per­son­nel. But what is im­por­tant is that wide body air­planes such as Boe­ing 747 and 767 and Air­bus 340 and 380 can now eas­ily land and take-off from Vic­to­ria Falls. The rapid de­vel­op­ment of tourism due the work done on the air­port will also drive up other re­lated in­dus­tries in Zim­babwe. China Jiangsu In­ter­na­tional is the same firm that was con­tracted to ex­pand Joshua Nkomo In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Bu­l­awayo, work it did sat­is­fac­to­rily. The same firm is ex­pected to work on ex­pand­ing the Harare In­ter­na­tional Air­port.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171020,Chi­nese democ­racy puts the West in the shade,"AS crises and chaos swamp West­ern lib­eral democ­racy, it may be in­struc­tive to ex­am­ine the “Chi­nese democ­racy” and ask how the sys­tem which sets the cur­rent stan­dards for de­vel­op­ment and progress mea­sures up. The 19th Na­tional Congress of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) is a good chance to an­a­lyse the unique so­cial­ist or­gan­i­sa­tion from his­tor­i­cal and global per­spec­tives. Ev­ery five years, CPC del­e­gates meet to draw up the strat­egy for both party and coun­try in the lus­trum to come. This year, the pri­mary ob­jec­tive is “Xiaokang,” the first cen­te­nary goal. A mere three years into the fu­ture, the es­tab­lish­ment of a mod­er­ately pros­per­ous so­ci­ety in 2020 will be the cul­mi­na­tion of 100 years of work by the CPC. The sec­ond cen­tury goal to com­mem­o­rate the found­ing of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China in 1949 will see the ful­fil­ment of the Chi­nese Dream of na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion. The CPC con­sulted with eight other non-Com­mu­nist par­ties and prom­i­nent fig­ures with­out party af­fil­i­a­tion in Au­gust when opin­ion and ad­vice were can­vassed on a draft re­port to the congress. This well-es­tab­lished prac­tice of in­sti­tu­tional con­sul­ta­tion is just one of the ways the CPC en­sures the demo­cratic na­ture of de­ci­sion-mak­ing. This CPC-led multi-party co­op­er­a­tion and con­sul­ta­tion sys­tem, an en­tirely new type of po­lit­i­cal sys­tem in­au­gu­rated in 1949, is very dif­fer­ent from the two-party and multi-party sys­tems in West­ern coun­tries or the one-party sys­tem prac­tised in some oth­ers. Un­like com­pet­i­tive, con­fronta­tional West­ern pol­i­tics, the CPC and non-Com­mu­nist par­ties co­op­er­ate with each other, work­ing to­gether for the ad­vance­ment of so­cial­ism and striv­ing to im­prove the peo­ple’s stan­dard of liv­ing. The re­la­tion­ship main­tains po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and so­cial har­mony and en­sures ef­fi­cient pol­icy mak­ing and im­ple­men­ta­tion. As the lead­ing party, the CPC takes ad­vice from other par­ties on ma­jor poli­cies, plans, re­vi­sions to the law and other mat­ters, al­low­ing mem­bers of other par­ties to hold of­fi­cial posts. In­sti­tu­tion­alised con­sul­ta­tive democ­racy is im­por­tant in China, whose ba­sic po­lit­i­cal sys­tems also in­clude the peo­ple’s con­gresses and self-gov­er­nance at the grass­roots level such as vil­lage com­mit­tees. The Chi­nese sys­tem leads to so­cial unity rather than the di­vi­sions which come as an un­avoid­able con­se­quence of the ad­ver­sar­ial na­ture of West­ern democ­racy to­day. End­less po­lit­i­cal back­bit­ing, bick­er­ing and pol­icy re­ver­sals, which make the hall­marks of lib­eral democ­racy, have re­tarded eco­nomic and so­cial progress and ig­nored the in­ter­ests of most cit­i­zens. The Con­sti­tu­tion of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China states that “the multi-party co­op­er­a­tion and po­lit­i­cal con­sul­ta­tion sys­tem un­der the lead­er­ship of the Com­mu­nist Party of China shall con­tinue to ex­ist and de­velop for a long time to come.” In par­lia­men­tary or pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics, par­ties ob­tain their le­git­i­macy in turn through bal­lot boxes, caus­ing fre­quent regime change and of­ten a com­plete about-face in pol­icy. What progress has been made is of­ten lost and in­ef­fi­ciency reigns. At 96 years old, the CPC, with 89 mil­lion mem­bers rep­re­sents the in­ter­ests of the ma­jor­ity of the peo­ple and is ded­i­cated to serv­ing the peo­ple, with peo­ple-cen­tred de­vel­op­ment deeply rooted in party cul­ture. The di­ver­sity of the party is clearly demon­strated by the ex­ten­sive rep­re­sen­ta­tion of dif­fer­ent walks of life among the more than 2 200 del­e­gates to the na­tional congress. As par­ties in the West in­creas­ingly rep­re­sent spe­cial in­ter­est groups and so­cial strata, cap­i­tal­ist democ­racy be­comes more oli­garchic in na­ture. The cracks are be­gin­ning to show, with many ec­cen­tric or un­ex­pected re­sults in re­cent plebiscites. Un­der the lead­er­ship of a sober­minded, for­ward-look­ing CPC, Chi­nese-style democ­racy has never been health­ier and China has ab­so­lutely no need to im­port the fail­ing party po­lit­i­cal sys­tems of other coun­tries. Af­ter sev­eral hun­dred years, the West­ern model is show­ing its age. It is high time for pro­found re­flec­tion on the ills of a dod­der­ing democ­racy, which has pre­cip­i­tated so many of the world’s ills and solved so few. If West­ern democ­racy is not to col­lapse com­pletely, it must be re­vi­talised, reap­praised and re­booted. The CPC has led the na­tion to un­par­al­leled growth and stag­ger­ing achieve­ments, par­tic­u­larly in the re­duc­tion of poverty. It may be fairly de­scribed as a trans­for­ma­tional mir­a­cle, bring­ing pros­per­ity and op­ti­mism that were unimag­in­able a mere four decades ago. Af­ter five years of in­ten­sive re­form, an un­prece­dented anti-cor­rup­tion cam­paign, and the mat­u­ra­tion of rule of law, a con­fi­dent CPC re­main­ing true to its found­ing tenets, is set fair to keep the coun­try on the right course “for a long time to come.” — Xin­hua.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190528,An­tibi­otic re­sis­tance: Pub­lic aware­ness cam­paigns might not work,"Pathogens, such as bac­te­ria, viruses and pro­to­zoa, are be­com­ing ever more re­sis­tant to drugs. Peo­ple speed up this nat­u­ral process by over-us­ing an­tibi­otics and other an­timi­cro­bial drugs in medicine and agri­cul­ture, and by leak­ing them into the en­vi­ron­ment. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) re­gards an­timi­cro­bial re­sis­tance as one of the top ten global threats to health. In re­sponse to this “su­per­bug” cri­sis, gov­ern­ments have cre­ated an ac­tion plan that in­cludes global aware­ness cam­paigns. How­ever, our lat­est re­search sug­gests that this strat­egy may not work. In fact, it may even be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive. For our study, we wanted to un­der­stand the role of ed­u­ca­tion and aware­ness rais­ing in non-West­ern coun­tries. To do this, we held half-day ed­u­ca­tional work­shops across five vil­lages in Thai­land and Laos. The find­ings of our re­search chal­lenge the con­ven­tional wis­dom that aware­ness cam­paigns are one of the best tools to change the way peo­ple use medicine. Pub­lic health aware­ness cam­paigns can have un­in­tended out­comes, in­clud­ing stig­ma­tis­ing peo­ple or inad­ver­tently en­cour­ag­ing the be­hav­iour they set out to dis­cour­age. Sim­i­lar prob­lems ex­ist in an­timi­cro­bial re­sis­tance cam­paigns and they be­come even more com­pli­cated in the non-West­ern cul­tures of ru­ral Thai­land and Laos. Peo­ple may not think about ill­nesses be­ing caused by bac­te­ria or viruses, or they might not use tech­ni­cal words for “an­tibi­otics”, but rather col­lo­quial terms like “ampi” (for ampi­cillin) without nec­es­sar­ily know­ing (or car­ing about) what th­ese drugs do. We adapted the lan­guage in our work­shops to this con­text and“aware­ness” in­creased.

But we could not pre­vent peo­ple from mak­ing their own sense of the new in­for­ma­tion. One par­tic­i­pant felt so much more con­fi­dent af­ter the work­shop that she be­gan sell­ing an­tibi­otics from her vil­lage shop! It is appealing to think that knowl­edge will im­prove be­hav­iour, but the evidence is mixed. A re­cent sur­vey in China de­tected, for ex­am­ple, that more ed­u­cated peo­ple were more likely to take left­over medicine in­stead of go­ing to a clinic when they had res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions. We noted sim­i­lar com­pli­ca­tions in our re­search. In Laos, work­shop par­tic­i­pants be­came more likely to go to pub­lic health cen­tres when they were sick, but they also con­sumed dou­ble the amount of an­tibi­otics than be­fore the work­shop. In Thai­land, ru­mours arose in the most ed­u­cated vil­lage that our work­shops were in­tended to ban all local medicine sales. In­for­ma­tion alone won’t cut it Even in the­ory, it is im­plau­si­ble that ed­u­ca­tion and aware­ness cam­paigns alone will com­pletely change peo­ple’s health be­hav­iour. Peo­ple’s ac­tions are not just the re­sult of an ab­sence of knowl­edge. For labour­ers or fac­tory work­ers who earn £8 a day to sup­port their fam­i­lies, ad­vice to un­der­take a jour­ney to a dis­tant pub­lic health clinic for a pre­scrip­tion may be fu­tile. They may take medicine from local stores in de­spair and (rightly) con­sider the global health goal of tack­ling drug re­sis­tance sec­ondary to their hard­ship. And yet when cir­cum­stances change, be­hav­iour might change, too. Our study in Thai­land re­vealed that the be­hav­iour of peo­ple whose fam­ily members help them through an ill­ness was more in line with rec­om­men­da­tions from the WHO, ir­re­spec­tive of their aware­ness about drug re­sis­tance. One hun­dred and twenty-five coun­tries are now car­ry­ing out drug re­sis­tance aware­ness cam­paigns. Be­fore we congratulate our­selves on the global ac­tion, we need to eval­u­ate their ef­fec­tive­ness and whether their side ef­fects out­weigh their ben­e­fits. If fac­tors like poverty, in­se­cure income or lack of ac­cess to health­care pre­vent peo­ple from act­ing on good ad­vice, then su­per­bug ed­u­ca­tion and aware­ness cam­paigns will prove costly, in­ef­fec­tive and in­sen­si­tive to peo­ple’s lives. — Con­ver­sa­tion Africa",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190523,US$120m tiles plant takes off,"A US$120 mil­lion tile man­u­fac­tur­ing plant near Nor­ton has gone full steam ahead, barely eight months af­ter man­age­ment got the nod to set up base lo­cally. Sunny Yi Feng Tiles (Zim­babwe) is al­ready op­er­at­ing three fac­to­ries that are mak­ing tiles, printing card­board boxes for pack­ag­ing the tiles and lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port, cov­er­ing up to 75 per­cent of its ca­pac­ity and is ex­pected to reach full pro­duc­tion soon. The com­pany started pro­duc­ing tiles on May 12 and is pro­duc­ing 25 000 square metres per day. Its in­stalled ca­pac­ity is 35 000 square metres of tiles per day. Sunny Yi Feng has em­ployed 1 000 peo­ple — 800 locals and 200 Chi­nese na­tion­als — which dove­tails with Gov­ern­ment’s as­pi­ra­tion to cre­ate jobs for citizens. Com­pany pres­i­dent Mr Tang Yi told The Her­ald dur­ing a plant tour yes­ter­day that a fur­ther 600 jobs will be cre­ated when the firm op­er­ates at full ca­pac­ity.“The US$120 mil­lion project has taken shape and three fac­to­ries are now in pro­duc­tion,” said Mr Tang through an in­ter­preter. “One fac­tory is for tile pro­duc­tion, the other is printing boxes for pack­ag­ing tiles while the third is the lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port unit where a num­ber of things such as spoons are be­ing made. “We are on sched­ule; we in­tend to set up six fac­to­ries here and we ex­pect another fac­tory pos­si­bly by July.” Sunny Yi Feng uses new gen­er­a­tion, highly com­put­erised equip­ment, and plans to sell 70 per­cent of its tiles in the re­gion and potentially Europe, while the re­main­der will be con­sumed lo­cally. This will help the coun­try earn the much-needed for­eign cur­rency. Chi­nese Em­bassy in Zim­babwe’s Coun­sel­lor (deputy chief of mis­sion) Mr Zhao Bao­gang told The Her­ald that the suc­cess of Sunny Yi Feng’s in­vest­ment will at­tract more in­vestors from the Asian gi­ant. “This is one of the projects un­der the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) where we come to in­vest and cre­ate jobs and also elim­i­nate poverty. “Can you imag­ine that they started in Oc­to­ber last year and only a few months down the line, they have built very big fac­to­ries? This is the Chi­nese speed of do­ing things and with this kind of speed, Zim­babwe’s econ­omy will be turned around in the near fu­ture. “As China, we are strongly be­hind the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa and this in­vest­ment is the first of more to come,”said Mr Zhao. He added that if Zim­babwe paced up re­forms on ease of do­ing busi­ness, par­tic­u­larly ac­cess to power, wa­ter and land, more Chi­nese in­vestors will flock to the coun­try.

Sunny Yi Feng uses 8MW of elec­tric­ity at its plant, but the kiln for mak­ing tiles is fired by coal which is trans­ferred to gas to elim­i­nate pol­lu­tion. The kiln is heated up to 1 200 de­grees Cel­sius to produce strong tiles. Raw ma­te­ri­als for tile mak­ing are ob­tained lo­cally, largely from Ma­zowe, Chegutu, Selous and Chakari.

zw,The Manica Post,20200522,The Africa we want,"ONE of the weapons used dur­ing the colo­nial pe­riod to en­sure a frag­mented Africa was the in­stal­la­tion of ge­o­graph­i­cal bor­ders. With 54 African nations split among the colo­nial gi­ants, Africans were con­di­tioned to be­lieve they were a dif­fer­ent peo­ple. Sadly, the shack­les of colo­nial­ism went deeper than that. Reg­gae artiste Bob Mar­ley sang about ‘men­tal slav­ery’, while pro­lific writer, Ngugi waThiong’o wrote about the colonised mind. With a great por­tion of the African pop­u­la­tion now fight­ing to re­store its true Africaness, the ef­fects of coloni­sa­tion of the mind still lingers in some. As a re­sult, years af­ter the at­tain­ment of in­de­pen­dence in African states, 54 frag­mented African nations still ex­ist de­spite the per­ceived African unity. We have the North­ern, South­ern, Western, East­ern and Cen­tral Africa bro­ken fur­ther into Fran­co­phone, An­glo­phone and Lu­so­phone Africa. Yet one um­bil­i­cal cord ties us all back to Mother Africa re­gard­less of our na­tion­al­ity, lan­guage, re­li­gion and cus­toms. We share im­por­tant his­tory and a price­less cul­ture. The bor­ders have inevitably brought about the cri­sis of na­tional con­scious­ness and iden­tity which is cur­rently rav­aging Africa and is giv­ing birth to dis­putes over na­tion­al­ity. For ex­am­ple, rogue el­e­ments in South Africa have in the re­cent past seen it fit to per­se­cute their fel­low African broth­ers and sis­ters for merely cross­ing the bor­ders into their coun­try. This in­sider Afro­pho­bia — the self-ha­tred, self-lac­er­a­tion and self-den­i­gra­tion of peo­ple of African de­scent — is a be­lief in self-pow­er­less­ness. As we com­mem­o­rate Africa Day in the next three days, it is cru­cial for African peo­ple to re­alise that we can’t hate our­selves and then ex­pect oth­ers to love and value us. We can­not talk of African unity when so many dis­par­i­ties ex­ist across our bor­ders, when our broth­ers and sis­ters in So­ma­lia wal­low in poverty and The Man­ica Post those in Mozam­bique and Nige­ria face at­tacks from fel­low coun­try­men. African unity is not a the­ory that we can just talk about, it has to be prac­ticed. For this rea­son, on May 25, 1963, Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah, Ethiopia’s Em­peror Haile Se­lassie, and 30 other Heads of State, formed the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity, now known as the African Union, in Ad­dis Ababa, Ethiopia. This year on May 25, Zim­babwe will once again join the rest of the African con­ti­nent to com­mem­o­rate the spe­cial day which pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity to ac­knowl­edge the achieve­ments of the peo­ple and gov­ern­ments of Africa, while re­flect­ing on the chal­lenges that the con­ti­nent is fac­ing in the global en­vi­ron­ment. A truly united Africa largely re­mains a gi­gan­tic dream cher­ished only by the great vi­sion­ar­ies of gen­uine pan-African­ism. They see the op­por­tu­ni­ties be­neath the imag­ined com­plex­i­ties. This dream re­duces Ce­cil John Rhodes’ am­bi­tion of con­trol­ling the whole of Africa, from Cape to Cairo, into a car­i­ca­ture. Zim­bab­wean born Dr Arikana Chi­hom­bori-Quao, an out­spo­ken pan-African who was dis­missed from her post as African Union Am­bas­sador to the United States last year, has never minced her words on neo-colo­nial­ism and has strong views on the in­de­pen­dence and gov­er­nance of Africa. We need to unite and build the Africa we all want. Agenda 2063 looks at the African peo­ple’s as­pi­ra­tions, in­clud­ing a more pros­per­ous fu­ture in which all its citizens are healthy, ed­u­cated and em­pow­ered to re­al­ize their full po­ten­tial. Africa’s pop­u­la­tion will be one of the con­duits to at­tain­ing the goals of Agenda 2063 and ul­ti­mately the con­ti­nent’s suc­cess. With a pop­u­la­tion re­ported to be cur­rently slightly above 1,3 bil­lion, such a large num­ber can work won­ders in build­ing po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic pow­ers, as com­pared to what can be achieved by the 14,5 mil­lion of Zim­babwe, Le­sotho’s 2,1 mil­lion or Swazi­land’s 1,1 mil­lion. Af­ter all they say when spi­ders unite they can catch a lion, isn’t it? It is not a co­in­ci­dence that China, the most pop­u­lous coun­try in the world with a whop­ping 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple, has the fastest grow­ing econ­omy in the world. Nei­ther is it a co­in­ci­dence that the United States of Amer­ica fol­lows hot in pur­suit with its 330 mil­lion peo­ple. In fact, most of the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­tries also tops the list of the world’s rich­est coun­tries. Pop­u­la­tion dy­nam­ics in­flu­ence de­vel­op­ment at the na­tional, re­gional and global lev­els. Africa needs to be united po­lit­i­cally and eco­nom­i­cally to be­come a world gi­ant that speaks to the Western coun­tries with one voice. Con­scious of the fact that free­dom, equal­ity, jus­tice and dig­nity are es­sen­tial ob­jec­tives for the achieve­ment of the as­pi­ra­tions of the Africa peo­ple, it is en­cour­ag­ing to note that Africa is now speak­ing with one voice against the il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe.

What was so en­cour­ag­ing about this “iso­la­tion” was the hope of the pos­si­bil­ity that the re­gion had fi­nally wo­ken up to the re­al­i­sa­tion that, this two-decade long cry by Zim­bab­wean au­thor­i­ties of a con­certed at­tack by Western coun­tries, pri­mar­ily the United States of Amer­ica (US), the United King­dom (UK), and Euro­pean Union (EU) — us­ing lo­cal prox­ies — was noth­ing more than a thin veil to jus­tify their re­lent­less, ruth­less crack­down on any gen­uine dis­sent by mil­lions of suf­fer­ing Zim­bab­weans, and the op­po­si­tion. How­ever, what we have wit­nessed, based on the state­ments is­sued to the pub­lic, the only coun­try to even men­tion the is­sue of some “asym­met­ric war­far”, was Zim­babwe it­self, rep­re­sented by Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Dam­budzo Mnan­gagwa — as oth­ers present, namely Botswana’s Mokg­weetsi Eric Ma­sisi, Zam­bia’s Edgar Lungu, and ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Ster­gom­ena Tax, never touched on the mat­ter, but only re­sort­ing to the usual pleas­antries on how the coun­try had chaired the or­gan well. As a group­ing of south­ern African coun­tries tasked with over­see­ing is­sues of pol­i­tics, de­fence and se­cu­rity in the re­gion, an at­tack on a fel­low neigh­bour would have surely taken cen­tre stage, and dom­i­nated the pro­ceed­ings — as they sought to find so­lu­tions to this ob­vi­ous threat to peace and se­cu­rity, in both the named coun­try and the re­gion. The Zim­babwe regime, which has man­aged to mer­ci­lessly ride roughshod over its own peo­ple ever since com­ing into power at the coun­try's in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tain in 1980 — char­ac­terised by a sav­age geno­cide that mas­sa­cred over 20 000 largely Nde­bele-speak­ing civil­ians, the mas­sacre of hun­dreds of real and per­ceived op­po­si­tion sup­port­ers, count­less re­ports of ab­duc­tions, tor­ture, burn­ing of houses, beat­ing up, sex­ual abuse, and ques­tion­able ar­rests of or­di­nary cit­i­zens, in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ists, lawyers, as well as labour and hu­man rights ac­tivists — may have fi­nally been ex­posed for its shame­ful lies and sadis­tic sub­ju­ga­tion, which a vet­eran of the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle once told me, “would make the Rhode­sia Spe­cial Branch green with envy”. Of course, it would be grossly naive, if not down­right disin­gen­u­ous, for me to dis­miss or rub­bish the in­ter­fer­ence of for­eign pow­ers in our in­ter­nal af­fairs — as geopo­lit­i­cal his­tory proves the un­de­ni­able fact that coun­tries al­ways med­dle in oth­ers’ is­sues, in or­der to safe­guard, or even im­pose, their own in­ter­ests. Even China and Rus­sia in­ter­fered in the coun­try’s in­ter­nal af­fairs dur­ing the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle, not be­cause they were gen­uinely in­ter­ested in our wel­fare, but sim­ply as a means to gain a foothold on our re­sources in an “in­de­pen­dent Zim­babwe” — which, they have clearly man­aged to do. How­ever, at­tribut­ing Zim­bab­wean peo­ple’s le­git­i­mate out­cry and out­rage at the ram­pant cor­rup­tion by the elit­ist op­por­tunis­tic rul­ing clique — who have shame­lessly looted bil­lions of bil­lions of US dol­lars of the coun­try's na­tional re­sources, thereby bankrupt­ing the en­tire econ­omy, leav­ing mil­lions of cit­i­zens wal­low­ing in ab­ject poverty and fac­ing star­va­tion to “for­eign en­ti­ties” is the most despicable ex­cuse ever known to mankind. Fur­ther­more, at­tempt­ing to jus­tify the mur­der­ous sup­pres­sion against those who have ex­posed this cor­rup­tion, and those who have stood up for the rights of Zim­bab­weans for a dig­ni­fied life — by la­belling them “dark forces”, “ter­ror­ists”, and “sell­outs” — clearly no longer holds trac­tion with fel­low re­gional neigh­bours, as they are wak­ing up to the re­al­ity. The ques­tion now is: “What will an or­gan­i­sa­tion no­to­ri­ous for be­ing noth­ing, but a leaders’ club, which has long re­neged on its found­ing front­line States prin­ci­ples of fight­ing on the side of the op­pressed masses, and not the rul­ing elite, do?” Based on Sadc's check­ered his­tory, the peo­ple of Zim­babwe would be fool­ish to hold their breath — as a leop­ard never changes its spots — but, at least, the iso­lated ranting by Mnan­gagwa showed that the truth has set in, even if the re­gional body will con­tinue pre­tend­ing as if it sees noth­ing. Whether this will prompt the or­gan­i­sa­tion to act, or not, is nei­ther here nor there — but, should serve as en­cour­age­ment to the mil­lions of im­pov­er­ished, op­pressed, and starved Zim­bab­weans that they should never give up the strug­gle — as it is pure, it is good, and it is blessed by the Almighty God — for, in­deed, #Zim­baweanLivesMat­ter.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151214,‘Youths must ven­ture into en­ergy projects’,"EN­ERGY and Power De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Sa­muel Un­denge says youths must ven­ture into re­new­able en­ergy projects to help re­solve power deficits. Min­is­ter Un­denge’s plea comes at a time the coun­try is fac­ing power cri­sis that has had de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fect on Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic and do­mes­tic ac­tiv­ity. Zim­babwe re­quires an av­er­age of 2 200 megawatts at peak pe­ri­ods of de­mand for power, but can only gen­er­ate about 900MW due to lim­ited gen­er­a­tion. The coun­try’s gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­ity has been fur­ther con­strained by fall­ing wa­ter lev­els in Kariba Dam, from which Kariba South hy­dro power sta­tion draws wa­ter and low out­put at the out­dated Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion. The en­ergy min­is­ter told del­e­gates at­tend­ing the of­fi­cial launch of the Green In­no­va­tions Hub (GiHUB Project) in Harare re­cently that clean and af­ford­able en­ergy was the key in or­der to achieve a sus­tain­able fu­ture for Zim­babwe. “There­fore, I am call­ing upon youths to take ad­van­tage of this unique op­por­tu­nity to con­trib­ute to end­ing en­ergy poverty, and the na­tion at large to sup­port this no­ble ini­tia­tive, grow it and make it a suc- cess,” the min­is­ter said. This comes as the Zim­babwe En­ergy Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity has is­sued over 20 li­cences to in­de­pen­dent power pro­duc­ers to ad­dress the power cri­sis. Youth­ful Harare businessman and In­tra­trek Zim­babwe man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Mr Wick­nell Chivhayo has al­ready seized the op­por­tu­nity af­ter his com­pany re­cently clinched mul­ti­mil­lion dol­lar re­new­able en­ergy (so­lar power) project. In­tra­trek has part­nered the world’s big­gest man­u­fac­turer of so­lar pan­els, CHiNT Elec­tric Co. Ltd of China for the con­struc­tion of one of Zim­babwe’s first three large-scale ground-mounted so­lar power plants with ca­pac­ity for 300MW. It is ex­pected that Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s re­cent State to Zim­babwe would see greater co­op­er­a­tion in the field of re­new­able en­ergy. China is home to some of the world’s big­gest so­lar projects. Unicef and De­vel­op­ment Re­al­ity In­sti­tute’s GiHUB project will pro­vide fund­ing to young peo­ple to run projects that ad­dress en­ergy chal­lenges, with fo­cus on smart en­ergy, such as so­lar, bio­gas and hy­dropower among oth­ers. Speak­ing at the launch event, Unicef’s Amy Wick­ham said the GiHUB project comes at an op­por- tune time of grow­ing in­ci­dence of re­ports of cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion af­fect­ing young peo­ple in Zim­babwe. She said that Zim­babwe is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing steady growth in en­ergy de­mand but ac­cess has re­mained lim­ited as only 40 per­cent have it in towns and 19 per­cent have power in ru­ral ar­eas, a sit­u­a­tion which needs to be ad­dressed.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20151213,You can’t make old friends,"YOUYÌ xiàng chún­jiu - yuè lao yuè hao. If friend­ship is like wine — the older the bet­ter. The Chi­nese proverb best de­scribes the ties be­tween Zim­babwe and China. And am­ple tes­ti­mony of this came on De­cem­ber 1-2, 2015 when Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping re­cip­ro­cated Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s 2014 State visit to China to cat­a­pult bi­lat­eral eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion to greater heights. Though the ma­jor deals were the cen­tre of the show, the dis­cern­able warmth and cor­dial­ity be­tween Pres­i­dents Mu­gabe and Xi told the story of two lead­ers with a com­mon un­der­stand­ing, with con­ver­gent ide­olo­gies. The warm em­brace upon Pres­i­dent Xi’s ar­rival said it all, and the hand-in-hand walk-about com­pleted the pic­ture of a friend­ship in full blos­som. It sym­bol­ised the grow­ing friend­ship be­tween their peo­ples, moreso cap­tur­ing their mu­tual re­spect and ad­mi­ra­tion. They were to give in­sights into Harare-Beijing re­la­tions dur­ing the sign­ing of 12 eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion agree­ments at State House later that evening. A riv­et­ing tête-à-tête fol­lowed, with nostal­gia and present and fu­ture co-op­er­a­tion tak­ing prime spots in the con­ver­sa­tion. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe spoke first: “We, in Zim­babwe, re­gard China as the best of our friends in­ter­na­tion­ally, and we do that not be­cause the Chi­nese are rich or beau­ti­ful. No. But be­cause China has demon­strated ac­tion . . . and they are our all-weather friends. “I don’t know how many times I vis­ited China (dur­ing Zim­babwe’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle). I was re­mark­ing to the Pres­i­dent that soon af­ter the demise of Pres­i­dent Mao Tse Tung, al­though the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity es­tab­lished a com­mit­tee to as­sist us, most of the as­sis­tance for guns, even what they call hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance, wel­fare as­sis­tance (was from China).” He went on: “Al­most ev­ery year, we went to China to say, ‘Please, give us more guns.’ And ev­ery year, I got many guns that, at least, en­abled us to arm a bri­gade; ev­ery year. They also en­abled us to train our cadres at the camps, also in China. “As we host you, we say we are host­ing you in your other coun­try, your sec­ond coun­try that you helped to free. So, you should feel free that you con­trib­uted to our free­dom, lib­er­a­tion and at­tain­ment of na­tional sovereignty.” On eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said, “This is then the new task that the peo­ple have; to turn their nat­u­ral re­sources into their wealth, but re­main in an en­vi­ron­ment of free­dom, in an en­vi­ron­ment in which they are the sov­er­eign own­ers of their coun­try and must guard against those oth­ers who want to im­pose their own weight, their own stance. “Na­tional sovereignty and free­dom were an ob­jec­tive of the past. Now that we have at­tained them, they be­come the means to fur­ther ob­jec­tives, th­ese ob­jec­tives be­ing the trans­for­ma­tion of our nat­u­ral re­sources so that they can be­come the food they want to eat, the clothes they want to wear, the ve­hi­cles they want to drive.” He also said, “That is an­other form of strug­gle where we need the tech­nol­ogy, the ex­pe­ri­ence and, in­deed, the ca­pac­ity, fi­nan­cial ca­pac­ity, which our friends have and they can as­sist us in that trans­for­ma­tive process of get­ting our wealth and get­ting our peo­ple raised not just as in­di­vid­u­als, but as a na­tion. “We are no longer fight­ing the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle. The main area now is of fight­ing the dis­ease, fight­ing poverty, fight­ing back­ward­ness. When we look at you and see what you have done, not only are you a good ex­am­ple to us, but as a good friend, we also think that you are a good helper in this process of trans­for­ma­tion. “Once you have been to a place, we say the first step, foot­print you make, is a last­ing foot­print which calls for yet an­other, or many more other foot­prints. We say, Come again’.” Pres­i­dent Xi re­cip­ro­cated: “Re­spected Pres­i­dent, old friend of the Chi­nese peo- ple, it’s such a plea­sure to be in Zim­babwe. This is my first visit to this coun­try and I’m here to hon­our the prom­ise that I made to Your Ex­cel­lency dur­ing the visit you made to China in Au­gust last year. “At that time I said to you, Zim­babwe would be my pre­ferred des­ti­na­tion on my next visit to Africa. Here I am, keep­ing my prom­ise. I want to thank you, Your Ex­cel­lency, for rush­ing back from the Con­fer­ence in France to re­ceive us here in Zim­babwe. When we ar­rived at the air­port, we were over­whelmed by the warmth of your Gov­ern­ment and your peo­ple.” He con­tin­ued: “We were deeply touched by what we saw and we could feel the tremen­dous reser­voir of good­will of the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple to­wards the Chi­nese. And I want to thank you and the whole Cab­i­net of yours for making such fruit­ful ar­range­ments for my visit.” Pres­i­dent Xi praised the African Union Chair for his prin­ci­pled lead­er­ship, de­scrib­ing him as a sea­soned states­man. “You have made im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tions to ce­ment­ing African unity and mov­ing for­ward Africa’s in­te­gra­tion process. I am sure, Your Ex­cel­lency, you will con­tinue to take Zim­babwe and Africa to new and greater ac­com­plish­ments. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe is a sea­soned states­man and a found­ing fa­ther of Africa who is re­spected across the con­ti­nent. In China, we also have peo­ple who hold you in the same high re­gard. “We are truly all-weather friends. The tra­di­tional friend­ship be­tween our two coun­tries goes back a long way. It has passed the test of time and in­ter­na­tional vi­cis­si­tudes and is as strong as ever. To­gether, our two coun­tries have shared will and woe to­gether. We have sup­ported each other and en­gaged in sin­cere co­op­er­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Xi added: “Your Ex­cel­lency, in your visit to China last year, we both agreed that China and Zim­babwe should be good part­ners, good friends and good broth­ers, fea­tur­ing mu­tual sup­port, win­win co­op­er­a­tion and com­mon de­vel­op­ment. “I am happy to see that over the past year and more, thanks to the ef­fi­cient work of both sides, the agree­ment that we reached on strength­en­ing var­i­ous ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion has prac­ti­cally been im­ple­mented and the fruits of the co­op­er­a­tion have ben­e­fited peo­ple in both coun­tries. “I want to re­it­er­ate, Your Ex­cel­lency, that China places high pre­mium on build­ing our re­la­tions with Zim­babwe. Zim­babwe is the only stop for my cur­rent tour to Africa for the sole pur­pose of a bi­lat­eral visit. I hope, through this visit, we can ce­ment the tra­di­tional friend­ship we have be­tween China and Zim­babwe. Even our prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion, take our bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship to the next level and de­liver more ben­e­fits to the Chi­nese and Zim­bab­wean peo­ples.” At the con­clu­sion of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion in South Africa, the two lead­ers held hands for close to 10 min­utes as they bade each other farewell. They con­versed, softly, warmly like true friends do. As Kenny Rogers and Dolly Par­ton sang back in 2013, you can’t make old friends.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20190915,Africa: The fu­ture is Machi­avel­lian,"AS rep­re­sented and also drama­tised in the events and in­ci­dents of re­cent weeks in South Africa; Africa is going through some dark and bloody times. Vul­ner­a­ble women have been raped and killed by men, some chil­dren kid­napped and oth­ers burnt with fires. Shops be­long­ing to the Pak­ista­nis and So­ma­lians have been looted and set on fire. Pub­lic buses have been set alight and mo­tor ve­hi­cles be­long­ing to pri­vate cit­i­zens torched in the streets. Fes­ti­vals of cru­elty and pure evil have been wit­nessed in the streets of the Repub­lic. It looks like ni­hilism. The mix­ture of vi­o­lent xeno­pho­bia and cruel femi­cide and in­fan­ti­cide has en­veloped the coun­try in fear, anger and fury. The vic­tims, clearly, are the weaker and vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, women, the for­eign­ers and chil­dren, upon which all sorts of angers and ha­treds can be vis­ited in any so­ci­ety in tur­moil. Some pow­er­ful peo­ple, such as the busi­ness ty­coon Gavin Wat­son of Bosasa, have died mys­te­ri­ous and sus­pi­cious deaths un­der ques­tion­able and wor­ri­some cir­cum­stances, a few days be­fore giv­ing what was to be a re­veal­ing tes­ti­mony be­fore the Judge Zondo State Cap­ture Com­mis­sion. In par­tic­u­lar, the logic of loot­ing and burn­ing, in­jur­ing and killing, rap­ing and wound­ing, has been turned into a strange but very true com­mon­sense of the mo­ment in South Africa. Other African coun­tries have re­acted with shock, anger and much con­cern as Zam­bians, usu­ally a peace­able peo­ple, and the Nige­ri­ans, have re­tal­i­ated by at­tack­ing long dis­tance trucks and shops in their coun­tries that be­long to South Africans. A true sea­son of anomy has set in and rendered the con­ti­nent dis­turbed and con­cern­ing. Clearly, things must ur­gently change for the bet­ter or we must just pre­pare for the worst, a war for all against all in Africa. A cer­tain rea­son­able cen­tre must hold us to­gether or we must pre­pare to fall where our pieces may not even be picked up. The trou­bling symp­tom of things A few weeks ago, some in­for­mal traders in Jo­han­nes­burg that have sim­plis­ti­cally been gen­er­alised in the me­dia as for­eign na­tion­als when they are a col­lec­tive of poor and strug­gling Africans from South Africa and else­where, braved Metro Po­lice of­fi­cers that had come to evict them, pelted them with stones and in­sults, un­til the armed of­fi­cers re­treated. A des­per­ate and sui­ci­dal kind of anger and frus­tra­tion has pos­sessed the poor in South Africa. The South African na­tion, since the end of ju­ridi­cal apartheid, has never been so dis­turbed. The State it­self, has never come un­der so much ques­tion and pres­sure, ren­der­ing it frag­ile and its fu­ture un­cer­tain. The scarcity of goods and ser­vices has cre­ated an an­gry scram­ble for life and hap­pi­ness that has made ev­ery­one look near­est and around for a weaker en­emy and vic­tim to pun­ish. Women, for­eign­ers and chil­dren are pay­ing the high­est price in the unfolding so­cial downslide in the land. The spec­ta­cles of cru­elty, suf­fer­ing and pure evil that are over­tak­ing South Africa, in my view, are just but a symp­tom of a struc­tural and sys­temic mal­ady that cov­ers the whole world, a world that is turn­ing. As the world turns, so­cially, po­lit­i­cally and his­tor­i­cally, Africa is bound to suf­fer the squeeze and the twist of things. South Africa as a political and eco­nomic cen­tre in Africa is bound to be the sta­dium upon which tragic per­for­mances of our times are to play out. The prover­bial piece of Europe in Africa that South Africa is can­not re­main in peace in times of change. The turn­ing world-sys­tem in Africa I write this ar­ti­cle ex­actly six days af­ter the pass­ing of Im­manuel Waller­stein, the Amer­i­can so­ci­ol­o­gist, and fore­most stu­dent and teacher of World-Sys­tems Anal­y­sis. De­colo­nially, World Sys­tems Anal­y­sis re­fuses to take in­di­vid­ual na­tion­states as units of anal­y­sis. Events, in­ci­dents and de­vel­op­ments in na­tion-states such as South Africa are read and un­der­stood in world-sys­temic and plan­e­tary terms. I also write af­ter my own week of en­gage­ment with the Sin­ga­porean the­o­rist of Pub­lic Pol­icy and stu­dent of World-Sys­tems, Kishore Mah­bubani, in his telling book: Has the West Lost It? The broad and also very high shoul­ders of th­ese two gi­ants, one re­cently de­parted and an­other trend­ing, per­mit one to stand and see far and close, and clearly, what fun­da­men­tally might be afoot in our trou­bling world. I was in­tro­duced to Im­manuel Waller­stein by Sa­belo Ndlovu-Gat­sheni the founder of Africa De­colo­nial Re­search Net­work (ADERN) and some col­leagues in the Latin Amer­i­can De­colo­nial Re­search Net­work (LADERN), among them Ra­mon Gros­foguel who is one of Waller­stein’s most pro­duc­tive and ef­fec­tive stu­dents. As for Mah­bubani, I stum­bled and fell on his work while re­search­ing and tak­ing notes for lec­tures on the De­colo­nial Vo­ca­tion that I have been giv­ing in dif­fer­ent uni­ver­si­ties in South Africa in the past three months. The De­colo­nial Col­lec­tive, world­wide, has strong per­spec­tives and views on what is hap­pen­ing from Brexit to the plan­e­tary ac­ci­dent called Don­ald Trump, the refugee cri­sis in Europe, Xeno­pho­bia in South Africa, and the in­creas­ing num­bers of the poor and the an­gry in the world. The in­creas­ing pow­er­less­ness of states and gov­ern­ments; and the strength­en­ing of right wing and fun­da­men­tal­ist political move­ments are ex­pli­ca­ble in de­colo­nial and world-sys­temic terms. Liv­ing in the End Times In 2010, Slavoj Zizek typ­i­cally fright­ened the think­ing world with his book: Liv­ing in the End times, a book in which he pre­dicted that the cap­i­tal­ist world faces a ter­mi­nal cri­sis where the eco­log­i­cal cri­sis (cli­mate change and nat­u­ral dis­as­ters,) ter­ror­ism, poverty, refugees, and in­creas­ing con­flict and in­equal­i­ties will bring the planet to a stand­still. Poverty will cause peo­ple to fight for scarce re­sources, im­mi­grants and refugees will be­come global scape­goats of the world so­cial cri­sis, Zizek pre­dicted. What Zizek did was to re­cy­cle and give new fash­ion to what Im­manuel Waller­stein pre­dicted in 1970, that the cap­i­tal­ist world econ­omy will come to cri­sis by caus­ing in­ter­nal prob­lems of it­self that it can­not solve, coun­tries will re­turn to nar­row na­tion­alisms that will put for­eign­ers and other vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple in trou­ble with na­tions and states. As I write, Europe in dis­in­te­grat­ing, Brexit is proof, pow­er­ful coun­tries are be­com­ing more xeno­pho­bic and racist, Trump’s Amer­ica is the tes­ti­mony. The ter­ror­ist shoot­ings in Amer­ica, ha­tred di­rected at Mex­i­cans and blacks are true signs of the times. In South Africa, South Africans pressed for re­sources and op­por­tu­ni­ties are di­rect­ing their anger against So­ma­lis, Pak­ista­nis, Nige­ri­ans and other for­eign­ers. The Repub­lic is be­gin­ning to pas­sion­ately look in­ward and see neigh­bours and even some lo­cals as par­a­sites that must leave or die. It is a world prob­lem in South Africa, and in Africa, not the sim­ple big­otry of South Africans. The world cap­i­tal­ist econ­omy and polity is in cri­sis and is daily man­u­fac­tur­ing scape­goats and vic­tims. Politi­cians and schol­ars have nei­ther ques­tions nor an­swers as to what ex­actly is hap­pen­ing in the Repub­lic. Or­di­nary peo­ple, hun­gry and an­gry, are pos­sessed of in­san­i­ties and are cre­at­ing vic­tims out of the next weak­est thing and per­son. Peo­ple are los­ing jobs in mass, prop­er­ties are getting re­pos­sessed by banks and liveli­hoods are in peril. Sui­cide rates are high, and so are mur­ders, femi­cides and in­fan­ti­cides, the econ­omy is in re­ces­sion and the pop­u­la­tion is de­pressed. For­eign­ers, women and chil­dren are the weak­est of the weak­est and vic­tims of the vic­tims in a set­ting of political and eco­nomic cri­sis. Mah­bubani: The fu­ture is Machi­avel­lian Mah­bubani re­minds us that the West is presently led by the Euro-Amer­i­can Em­pire has only led the world for the past 200 Years. From AD 1 to 1820, the two largest economies of the world were those of China and In­dia. In the long his­tory of the past 1800 years, the West has only been an Em­pire for 200 years, a small part of the long duree. Only af­ter 1820 did Europe pros­per fol­lowed by Amer­ica. This re­al­ity is rad­i­cally chang­ing. China, fol­lowed by In­dia are back as lead­ing economies of the world. Other large parts of Asia have also pros­pered and such coun­tries as Sin­ga­pore have man­aged to de­colonise and mod­ernise their poli­ties and economies with­out west­ern­ising their cul­tures. In China Deng Xiaop­ing used the 1980s to launch the Four Moderni­sa­tions Pol­icy: Re­form­ing Agri­cul­ture, In­dus­try, Na­tional De­fence and Sci­ence and tech­nol­o­gis­ing the coun­try. In In­dia, Narasimha Rao, at the same time opened the econ­omy for busi­ness and re­alised a boom. In light of the rise of China and In­dia Amer­ica and Europe are scared. From the en­trance of China into the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 2001, things have never been the same. World eco­nomic and political power is in­evitably chang­ing hands and di­rec­tion. The West has re­acted with right wing political and eco­nomic log­ics. Trade wars, racism and xeno­pho­bia. The West is in panic at the re­turn of the Rest to political and eco­nomic promi­nence. Ter­ror­ism and counter-ter­ror­ism, bash­ing for­eign­ers and refugees are but the struc­tural and sys­temic symp­toms of the chang­ing times in the world. When the West launched the G7 in 1976 the world’s pow­er­ful economies reg­is­tered a share of the Global GDP of 45, per­cent by 1995. At the time, the small economies, the E7 reg­is­tered 22,6 per­cent. In 2015, the E7 held 36,3 per­cent while the G7 suf­fered a fall to 31,5 per­cent. The Devil hides in the statis­tics. 2050, eco­nom­i­cally and po­lit­i­cally looks like the prop­erty of Asia and the Global South, if this change in the world is han­dled well, not with war. I con­clude with Kishore Mah­bubani that, true to Nic­colo Machi­avelli, a new or­der of things is needed in the pol­i­tics and eco­nom­ics of the world. Africa, in par­tic­u­lar, must lead in think­ing other­wise and de­colonis­ing poli­ties and economies, and po­si­tion­ing it­self to ben­e­fit from the change of Em­pires. Pan-African­ism, more than na­tion­al­ism, is what the coun­tries of the con­ti­nent ur­gently need. Colo­nial bor­ders and the for­eign­ers that they came with are prop­er­ties of the pre­vi­ous Em­pire. Racism, xeno­pho­bia and na­tivism are lega­cies of the western Em­pire that must have no place in a de­colonised con­ti­nent. A new Or­der of Things is due.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200815,Cam­pus re­flec­tions,"Melissa Mhangami Mid­lands State Univer­sity WHEN an un­ex­pected and un­de­sir­able deadly in­fec­tious disease like Covid-19 be­comes a pan­demic, it causes fear, anx­i­ety and dis­tress among so­ci­eties. This is un­der­stand­able, but the more wor­ri­some part of it is the stigma at­tached to those in­fected find them­selves in. In so­ci­ol­ogy term Erv­ing Huff­man de­scribed stigma as an at­ti­tude, be­hav­iour or rep­u­ta­tion which is so­cially dis­cred­it­ing in a par­tic­u­lar way. So­cial stigma as a re­sult of Covid- 19 has led to dis­crim­i­na­tion of the in­fected pa­tients and those sus­pected to be Covid-19-pos­i­tive. This is ex­ac­er­bated by the fact that ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( WHO), those in­fected should be iso­lated or quar­an­tine to pre­vent spread­ing the virus. Stigma af­fects neg­a­tively the peo­ple who have ex­pe­ri­enced it and the so­ci­ety as whole. Groups stig­ma­tised may feel ex­cluded, un­wanted, iso­lated, de­pressed, hurt and feel re­jected by their own peo­ple, hence their re­duced so­cial and eco­nomic par­tic­i­pa­tion. The stig­ma­tised group have a higher chance of be­ing de­nied jobs and education op­por­tu­ni­ties, mak­ing them feel so­cial out­casts. Stigma can also neg­a­tively af­fect the emo­tional, men­tal and phys­i­cal health of the stig­ma­tised groups and com­mu­ni­ties they live in. The more wor­ri­some and un­de­sir­able ef­fect is that stigma can stop the health work­ers and emer­gency ser­vice providers from as­sist­ing those in need. Stigma re­lated to Covid- 19 is un­doubt­edly caused by the fact that the disease has no cure as yet and peo­ple un­der­stand the disease spreads rapidly, so peo­ple are gen­er­ally in panic mode. The disease’s symp­toms are sim­i­lar to those of com­mon flu, breath­ing prob­lems and headaches and this causes con­fu­sion where peo­ple end up dis­crim­i­nat­ing against un­af­fected peo­ple. One is likely to be iso­lated and treated like a Covid-19 pa­tient, if one has flu. This may lead to se­vere de­pres­sion. The fear is also a re­sult of in­creased mis­in­for­ma­tion about how the virus spreads. Usu­ally, stig­ma­ti­sa­tion hap­pens when the disease is linked with cer­tain peo­ple, groups, na­tion­al­i­ties, or race. For ex­am­ple, the stigma re­lated to Covid-19 is wit­nessed on a global level where the United States and Europe, stig­ma­tise peo­ple of Asian de­scent and these vic­tims are treated with sus­pi­cion and blamed for Covid-19. In Zim­babwe, the groups which are likely to ex­pe­ri­ence stigma re­lated to Covid-19 are the peo­ple re­turn­ing from other coun­tries re­gard­less of them hav­ing the symp­toms or not, or hav­ing been tested for the disease . The health work­ers and emer­gency re­spon­ders are also not spared as they suc­cumb to stigma. An­other group which faces se­vere stigma is of those recovering from the ill­ness who have been re­leased from the quar­an­tine. These peo­ple find it hard to be fairly ac­cepted in so­ci­ety, lead­ing to low so­cial es­teem and de­mor­al­i­sa­tion. Ev­ery­one can help stop stig­ma­ti­sa­tion by know­ing and get­ting facts about Covid-19 from rep­utable sources such as Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion ( CDC) and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( WHO) which are trust­wor­thy sources of in­for­ma­tion. The me­dia needs to speak pos­i­tively about the virus so that it doesn’t cre­ate a bad per­cep­tion of those in­fected with disease. Du­misani Mvula Mid­lands State Univer­sity IS our tra­di­tional education still the key to suc­cess? It does not re­quire rocket sci­ence to see that our tra­di­tional education is fail­ing to keep up with the new in­for­ma­tion era. I ad­vo­cate for education be­cause it is ev­ery child’s right to be ed­u­cated. How­ever, our education needs to be geared to meet the de­mands of the present world re­al­i­ties. Look­ing closely, the tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try leads when it comes to up­grad­ing and gen­er­at­ing new ideas. For ex­am­ple, Mi­crosoft re­leases a new soft­ware ev­ery year which comes up with new and im­proved func­tions. Our education sys­tem has not changed from the time it was in­tro­duced. Go to school and get a good pay­ing job, is what our tra­di­tional education teaches us. It never teaches us about mak­ing money. It is time we change. Enzo Fer­rari was founder of Fer­rari Ray Kroc was founder of Mc­Don­alds Henry Ford was founder of Ford Mo­tor Com­pany Bill Gates was founder of Mi­crosoft Mark Zucker­berg was founder of Face­book The list above is just few of the many who founded suc­cess­ful com­pa­nies with or with less tra­di­tional education. I am not say­ing education is not im­por­tant but I am say­ing there is more that can be done with the com­bi­na­tion of education and cre­ative think­ing. “The Gov­ern­ment is not do­ing any­thing for us”, is the state­ment that most of the youths are fond of re­peat­ing daily. It is time we ask our­selves the ques­tions, what are we do­ing for the coun­try? Jack Ma, a Chi­nese bil­lion­aire, once said that in­stead of com­plain­ing one should think of ways that he or she can gen­er­ate in­come. Our unemployment rate is in­creas­ing ev­ery time uni­ver­si­ties re­lease grad­u­ates ev­ery year onto the mar­ket. This is so be­cause all the grad­u­ates have the men­tal­ity of work­ing but none thinks of com­ing up with ideas to cre­ate em­ploy­ment. The Gov­ern­ment has all sort of chan­nels which are ready to ex­plore fund­ing mod­els for start-up busi­nesses which can be brought up by youths but it is dis­ap­point­ing that such chan­nels are not ben­e­fit­ing many be­cause our education man­u­fac­tures work­ers not en­trepreneurs. We need to be eman­ci­pated from this men­tal­ity. What is needed in Zim­babwe are more youths with the busi­ness mind of Strive Masiyiwa. Many youths turn to drugs, ad­vis­ing each other that they are es­cap­ing from poverty and unemployment. The truth is that such type of think­ing is go­ing to lead us deep into poverty. Henry Ford was not ed­u­cated just like most of the Zim­bab­wean youths who have turned to drugs. But Ford did not turn to drugs. In­stead, he took time to think of ways to make money and he worked on mod­i­fy­ing an al­ready ex­ist­ing en­gine and founded his own com­pany. This is the men­tal­ity that will de­velop Zim­babwe. Run­ning away from our beau­ti­ful coun­try and go­ing to other coun­tries, work­ing hard to grow their economies while charg­ing that our econ­omy is bad, is not the so­lu­tion to the prob­lem. No one is go­ing to de­velop our econ­omy but us. It is time as youths we en­gage the gov­ern­ment with great ideas that they can fund and work on in­creas­ing the num­ber of our lo­cal in­dus­tries. The list of those who turned out to be suc­cess­ful busi­ness peo­ple in the world is end­less. Noth­ing was spe­cial about those peo­ple, who had lit­tle or lim­ited education but nev­er­the­less turned out to be suc­cess­ful busi­ness peo­ple own­ing their own com­pa­nies and cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment. This is a chal­lenge to univer­sity stu­dents in Zim­babwe, let us put pres­sure on the gov­ern­ment for money to fund our ideas and pro­duc­tive projects rather than youths who are al­ways ready to cross the bor­der to work in for­eign lands. Let us cre­ate em­ploy­ment. Let us not wait to be em­ployed. Let us eman­ci­pate our­selves from this men­tal­ity. Loreen Mpofu Mid­lands State Univer­sity AS 2020 turns out to be a very dif­fer­ent year, where the whole world is locked down, there are rea­sons to feel the pos­i­tiv­ity it brings to mother Earth. In or­der to de­feat the deadly coron­avirus, ev­ery­thing is locked down — fac­to­ries are shut, no ve­hi­cles are al­lowed in spite of the pub­lic ZUPCO trans­port chal­lenges, and col­leges and busi­nesses are closed. In short, for the first time, peo­ple are be­ing less dis­rup­tive. Birds are chirp­ing, wa­ter is clearer, air pol­lu­tion is de­creas­ing and an­i­mals are re­turn­ing to their habi­tats. China and other coun­tries have recorded less pol­lu­tion, rivers are self — clean­ing and dol­phins are re­turn­ing to seas. Mother earth is heal­ing quickly with­out hu­man in­ter­rup­tion. The pan­demic is not only in­flict­ing pos­i­tive re­sults on na­ture it­self but also on hu­mans. Most peo­ple are util­is­ing the lock­down pe­riod to work on shap­ing up mar­riages, work­ing out and af­ford­ing rest to those who nor­mally work non­stop. In this in­stance, the lock­down be­comes a bless­ing in dis­guise.",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20210115,Beyond im­port sub­sti­tu­tion,"IN his mem­oirs, “A Promised Land”, for­mer US Pres­i­dent Barack Obama de­scribes Dr Man­mo­han Singh, the for­mer Prime Min­is­ter of In­dia, as “a gen­tle, soft-spo­ken econ­o­mist”. In their en­gage­ments, he found him “to be wise, thought­ful, and scrupu­lously hon­est”. He writes that Prime Min­is­ter Singh “engi­neered the mod­erni­sa­tion of his na­tion’s econ­omy … man­ag­ing to lift mil­lions of peo­ple out of poverty.” A glow­ing re­view as this is likely to make any pro­fes­sional to whom it is di­rected un­com­fort­able moreso if the pro­fes­sional is a soft-spo­ken econ­o­mist as him. Dubbed “the ac­ci­den­tal Prime Min­is­ter”, he wears that ti­tle with­out a trace of hurt. In fact, he am­pli­fies the ti­tle with hu­mor­ous sin­cer­ity: “peo­ple say I was an ac­ci­den­tal prime min­is­ter (but) I was also ac­ci­den­tal fi­nance min­is­ter”. He was min­is­ter of fi­nance in Prime Min­is­ter Rao’s gov­ern­ment from 1991 to 1996. He was the ac­ci­den­tal prime min­is­ter from 2004 to 2014. It is rather awk­ward to at­tribute In­dia’s eco­nomic suc­cess to Dr Singh’s premier­ship. This is not just be­cause “it takes a vil­lage” but that even Prime Min­is­ter Rao, who is of­ten cred­ited with set­ting-off In­dia’s as­cent, ar­guably rolled-out pol­icy ideas that had cir­cu­lated in the coun­try for decades. In­dia gained in­de­pen­dence in 1947. Im­port sub­sti­tu­tion, which had been the key in­dus­trial pol­icy for the colony since the 1920s, con­tin­ued as such af­ter in­de­pen­dence. In the five years to 1974, In­dia was at her au­tar­kic peak. Mean­while, em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence on the fail­ure of im­port sub­sti­tu­tion to gal­vanise in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion in the global south was mount­ing and some coun­tries were aban­don­ing it. In that height­ened state of au­tarky, gov­ern­ment un­der­took stud­ies ex­plor­ing how the econ­omy could be re­ju­ve­nated. Rec­om­men­da­tions were: lib­er­alise the econ­omy and im­prove in­ter­na­tional trade ie, ex­port ori­en­ta­tion. Noth­ing much came of it. When Indira Gandhi re­turned to power (1980 to 1983) hav­ing lost in 1977, her at­tempt at eco­nomic re­forms did not dent es­tab­lished pol­icy. When her son Ra­jiv Gandhi took over (1984 to 1989) af­ter her as­sas­si­na­tion, op­po­si­tion to re­forms didn’t wane. Then the Ber­lin Wall came down in 1989. The fall pre­sented In­dia with what Daren Ace­moglu and James Robin­son in “Why Na­tions Fail” call a crit­i­cal junc­ture: an un­planned event which, de­pend­ing on how a so­ci­ety acts on it, sub­stan­tially changes the so­ci­ety’s fu­tures from pre­vi­ously likely tra­jec­to­ries. In 1991, Prime Min­is­ter Rao took charge of gov­ern­ment and Dr Singh be­came the ac­ci­den­tal fi­nance min­is­ter in a mi­nor­ity gov­ern­ment with odds staked against it. Yet, economists who had been brushed aside for years found their voice. Prime Min­is­ter Rao him­self was one of them. His strat­egy was to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity, at­tract cap­i­tal and ramp-up ex­ports. In­ter­est­ingly back in 1961, the ac­ci­den­tal fi­nance min­is­ter had ti­tled his PhD the­sis “In­dia’s ex­port per­for­mance, 1951–1960, ex­port prospects and pol­icy im­pli­ca­tions”. Now was his mo­ment. The new gov­ern­ment faced many chal­lenges from word go. The econ­omy had been strug­gling for decades. In 1991, in­fla­tion was in mid-teens. Pub­lic debt was US$72 bil­lion from US$18 bil­lion in 1980. Since ex­ports had never re­ally been com­pet­i­tive, the trade ac­count was a sorry sight ex­ert­ing pres­sure on the cur­rency hence Moody’s down­grade. That was not all. In 1990, Iraq had in­vaded Kuwait and this af­fected mi­grant work­ers in the Gulf hence re­mit­tances. What did gov­ern­ment do to ad­dress all this? Just like Zim­babwe in the 1990s, In­dia opened-up the stock ex­change to for­eign in­vestors. Tar­iffs were slashed from 72,6 to 29 per­cent within a decade. The cur­rency was de­val­ued and con­vert­ibil­ity al­lowed on the cap­i­tal ac­count. As in Zim­babwe, the tele­coms sec­tor (among others) was opened up. But un­like Zim­babwe, re­forms in In­dia were not a World Bank pro­gramme. They were home­grown plans in­formed by own analy­ses and driven mainly by own re­sources. The World Bank just hap­pened to like what it was see­ing and so did others. Many lo­cal in­dus­tri­al­ists op­posed the re­forms. The “Bom­bay Club” for in­stance ar­gued that en­try of multi­na­tion­als was cost­ing jobs. Nu­mer­ous cham­bers of com­merce protested the bi­lat­eral, re­gional and mul­ti­lat­er­als trade ar­range­ments gov­ern­ment was pur­su­ing. For sure, In­dia was giv­ing away too much in some agree­ments eg, trade deals with Sri Lanka. But it was all for the long haul and ul­ti­mately the deals boosted ex­ports and dwarfed the ini­tial sac­ri­fices. Af­ter ini­tial hic­cups in the Look East Pol­icy mainly be­cause of his­toric ten­sions with Pak­istan and the Asian Fi­nan­cial Cri­sis, In­dia man­aged to in­sert her­self in the re­gion’s eco­nomic ar­range­ments es­pe­cially af­ter Septem­ber 11, 2001 at­tacks in the US and when the ac­ci­den­tal Fi­nance Min­is­ter ac­ci­den­tally be­came Prime Min­is­ter in 2004. To­day, the coun­try is a ma­jor player in the global econ­omy. In his mem­oirs, Ti­mothy Gei­th­ner Sec­re­tary of Trea­sury in Pres­i­dent Obama’s first ad­min­is­tra­tion writes: “We gave the ma­jor emerg­ing mar­ket economies such as China and In­dia a seat at the ta­ble so that they would be part of de­sign­ing new rules and there­fore more will­ing to im­pose them on their own emerg­ing fi­nan­cial mar­kets”. Pres­i­dent Obama in his mem­oirs tells us how he, unan­nounced, walked into a closed meet­ing of lead­ers of Brazil, In­dia, China and South Africa at the Copen­hagen Sum­mit (2009) to en­sure the four de­fi­ant emerg­ing coun­tries ac­cepted US pro­posal on a frame­work to mit­i­gate cli­mate change. The de­fi­ant coun­tries’ fun­da­men­tal ar­gu­ment was that the West is re­spon­si­ble for global warm­ing, it must fix the prob­lem, it must not over­bur­den de­vel­op­ing coun­tries strug­gling to im­prove their del­i­cate state. Clearly, the post-WW2 or­der and ten­sions are still in place yet part­ner­ship such BRICS are in­trigu­ing es­pe­cially the fact that coun­tries as au­tar­kic as In­dia was five decades ago are now key play­ers in the global econ­omy. Im­port sub­sti­tu­tion was In­dia’s main in­dus­trial pol­icy for decades. The pol­icy ap­peals to lo­cals to min­imise con­sump­tion of for­eign goods. Gov­ern­ments but­tress the ap­peal by rous­ing na­tion­al­is­tic sen­sa­tions on one hand and on the other, lim­it­ing im­ports through steep tar­iffs or out­right bans. On the con­trary, a mantra such as “Made in In­dia” is an ap­peal to any­one any­where in the world to con­sider set­ting up a fac­tory in In­dia. This plea when hon­est ex­erts pres­sure on gov­ern­ment to en­sure the coun­try is a com­pet­i­tive in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion. In De­cem­ber 2020, UNCTAD awarded Best In­vest­ment Pro­mo­tion Agency to In­dia’s con­firm­ing not just that the in­vest­ment cli­mate in that coun­try is com­pet­i­tive but that its poli­cies are im­ple­mented scrupu­lously. The path to eco­nomic pros­per­ity was clear way back in the 1960s: ex­port-ori­ented in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. Through it, ef­fi­ciency in mak­ing things and in pro­vid­ing ser­vices be­comes the ba­sis for pa­tri­o­tism. Coun­tries like South Korea saw the path early and swiftly aban­doned im­port sub­sti­tu­tion. Others like In­dia took a bit longer to get their act to­gether. Africa has been me­an­der­ing to a promised land for a long time but maybe for not much longer. The African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area which kicked-off this month is that home­grown plan bound to change the con­ti­nent’s fu­tures from pre­vi­ously likely tra­jec­to­ries. It re­de­fines lo­cal and that is good.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151205,Pres­i­dent blasts Africa’s de­trac­tors Pres­i­dent vin­di­cated,"PRES­I­DENT Robert Mu­gabe yes­ter­day blasted as dis­torted, claims by Africa’s de­trac­tors that the con­ti­nent’s re­la­tions with China were based on the Asian coun­try’s ap­petite for raw min­er­als. Speak­ing at the sum­mit for the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) here, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said Africa’s re­la­tions with China go deeper than that and the Asian coun­try was ac­tu­ally do­ing more for the con­ti­nent than its for­mer colonis­ers. “Once again, our de­trac­tors have sought to por­tray and re­duce re­la­tions to purely com­mer­cial ties driven, in their view, by China’s ap­petite for raw ma­te­ri­als from our con­ti­nent. That is what they say. On the con­trary, re­al­ity, for­tu­nately, does not con­form to such dis­torted imag­i­na­tive creations,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “Our re­la­tions go much deeper than the ex­trac­tion of re­sources. We’re com­mit­ted to strength­en­ing the cur­rent multi-faceted and multi di­men­sional re­la­tions be­tween African coun­tries and China.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe was speak­ing af­ter Chi­nese Pres­i­dent and FOCAC co-chair­per­son Xi Jin­ping, had said in ad­dress that his coun­try was offering $60 bil­lion in loans and grants to Africa over the next three years. South African Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma is the cochair­per­son of the sum­mit be­ing held un­der the theme, “China-Africa Pro­gress­ing To­gether: Win-Win Co­op­er­a­tion for Com­mon De­vel­op­ment.” Pres­i­dent Xi also an­nounced that his coun­try will roll out 10 ma­jor pro­grammes to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in the com­ing three years in the ar­eas of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion and pub­lic wel­fare, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and peace and se­cu­rity Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe, who is also the African Union chair­per­son be­fore his speech de­scribed Pres­i­dent Xi’s state­ment as rich in terms of cov­er­ing as­sis­tance across all sec­tors of the con­ti­nent’s econ­omy. “Here’s a man rep­re­sent­ing a coun­try once called poor, a coun­try which never was our colonis­ers, but there you are, he’s do­ing to us what we ex­pected those who colonised us yes­ter­day to do. If they have ears to hear, let them hear. We say, may God bless China and its peo­ple,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said the sum­mit cel­e­brates a mile­stone in the evo­lu­tion of FOCAC in the 15 years of its in­cep­tion. “We there­fore reded­i­cate our­selves to the prin­ci­pal guide­lines of our re­la­tions and to the mu­tu­al­ity of the out­comes we seek in our co­op­er­a­tion in the po­lit­i­cal, eco­nomic, cul­tural and se­cu­rity spheres. Since the in­cep­tion of FOCAC, we have wit­nessed tremen­dous growth in re­la­tions be­tween Africa and China,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said China has be­come Africa’s premier in­vest­ment and trad­ing part­ner, a trend which will scale up AfricaChina trade vol­umes to $400 bil­lion by 2020 from $220 bil­lion in 2014. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe com­mended ef­forts by FOCAC to deepen in­sti­tu­tional ties with re­gional bod­ies such as the AU and its struc­tures as well as the African De­vel­op­ment Bank. “We wel­come China’s sup­port for our de­ter­mi­na­tion to trans­form our coun­tries’ economies, through an in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion strat­egy which is driven by ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and value ad­di­tion of our nat­u­ral re­sources and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “We also deeply ap­pre­ci­ate China’s will­ing­ness and readi­ness to con­tinue to be a key part­ner in the de­vel­op­ment of our in­fra­struc­ture at the na­tional, re­gional and con­ti­nen­tal level.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said sev­eral group­ings of African coun­tries took some ma­jor de­ci­sions that, when im­ple­mented, will give strong im­pe­tus to im­prov­ing in­traAfrican trade, and in offering ex­ter­nal part­ners such as China, a much larger source and trade mar­ket. He said the Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (CFTA) and Comesa — EAC —Sadc Tri­par­tite Free Trade Area should con­trib­ute to in­te­grat­ing Africa’s mar­kets in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the free move­ment of goods. “There is no doubt that the rise of China and Africa, as two sig­nif­i­cant play­ers, will have a pos­i­tive and far reach­ing im­pact in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions that en­sure the democrati­sa­tion of the in­ter­nal sys­tem of gov­er­nance,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “The per­pet­u­a­tion of the his­toric in­jus­tice of the cur­rent sys­tem, be it in the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil or the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions, is un­healthy and un­de­sir­able. Now to­gether with China we should push for real democ­racy at the United Na­tions. We con­tinue to count on China’s sup­port and sol­i­dar­ity in re­dress­ing this sit­u­a­tion.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said in pur­suit of im­ple­ment­ing the global de­vel­op­ment agenda adopted at the United Na­tions in New York last Septem­ber, it was im­por­tant to as­sess the ef­fi­ciency of FOCAC in the new de­vel­op­ment con­text. In his ad­dress, Pres­i­dent Xi called for the up­grad­ing of China-Africa strate­gic part­ner­ship to a com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship as­sur­ing the con­ti­nent that his coun­try will ad­here to the prin­ci­ples of sin­cer­ity, real re­sults, affin­ity and good faith and strike a right bal­ance be­tween up­hold­ing prin­ci­ples and pur­su­ing ben­e­fits in its Africa pol­icy. Pres­i­dent Xi said the co­op­er­a­tion will be based on equal­ity and mu­tual trust and that his coun­try’s stance that Africa should man­age its own af­fairs and that China was ready to as­sist the con­ti­nent in safe­guard­ing peace and se­cu­rity. Pres­i­dent Zuma paid trib­ute to Pres­i­dent Xi for the new mea­sures and also ac­knowl­edged, “the tan­gi­ble con­tri­bu­tion of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China’s with re­gard to peace­keep­ing in Africa. In ad­di­tion to par­tic­i­pat­ing in up to six­teen United Na­tions Peace­keep­ing Mis­sions in Africa, China cur­rently has ap­prox­i­mately 2,000 peace­keep­ing per­son­nel on the ground. We ap­pre­ci­ate this com­mit­ment to peace, de­vel­op­ment and progress,” said Pres­i­dent Zuma. “It gives prac­ti­cal mean­ing to the be­lief of Pres­i­dent Xi that China’s mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­ity must be utilised to achieve peace.” ZIM­BABWE’S Look East pol­icy has been vin­di­cated as the en­tire African con­ti­nent is ben­e­fit­ting from the suc­cess­ful host­ing of the sum­mit on the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion that ends here to­day, a diplo­mat said yes­ter­day. Zim­babwe Am­bas­sador to China Paul Chikava, speak­ing on the side­lines of the sum­mit, said, “Our Pres­i­dent has been vin­di­cated be­cause 15 years ago when he told us that East was where life was, we doubted him but look here we’ve just been vis­ited two days ago, our two lead­ers had very fruit­ful dis­cus­sions, we’re now in South Africa and the whole of Africa and the Chi­nese in­clud­ing our own Pres­i­dent who is play­ing a very im­por­tant role in the seal­ing of th­ese mega deals.” Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe joined his South African and Chi­nese coun­ter­parts Ja­cob Zuma and Xi Jin­ping in of­fi­cially open­ing the China Africa Equip­ment Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­dus­try Ex­hi­bi­tion. The ex­hi­bi­tion was part of a FOCAC Busi­ness Fo­rum hosted by the South African Depart­ment of Trade and In­dus­try and the Chi­nese Min­istry of Commerce. The lead­ers were then taken on a guided tour of the ex­hi­bi­tion where var­i­ous prod­ucts and equip­ment were be­ing show­cased. Af­ter the tour, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the ex­hi­bi­tion re­in­forces the ethos of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, which is the fo­cus at Sadc, Comesa-EAC-Sadc Tri­par­tite and con­ti­nen­tal lev­els. “It’s also im­pres­sive and en­cour­ag­ing to note that mem­ber states have been de­vel­op­ing their own in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion poli­cies linked and aligned to the strate­gies and roadmaps of re­gional eco­nomic com­mu­ni­ties and the African Union’s Agenda 2063,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “What we’ve seen is a clear tes­ti­mony of the tremen­dous ef­forts to­wards pri­ori­tis­ing value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of our nat­u­ral re­sources and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts. “Such ef­forts are aimed at boost­ing in­tra-African trade as well as trade with other coun­tries within the South-South and North-South.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe em­pha­sised com­ple­ment in­dus­try with trade. He said the con­ti­nent looked for­ward to co­op­er­at­ing with China and at the same time seek to im­prove the qual­ity of its pro­cessed prod­ucts. “Africa and China need to work to­gether to en­sure that road, rail, air, power and wa­ter in­fras­truc­tures are put in place. “In ad­di­tion, equip­ment and ap­pro­pri­ate tech­nol­ogy of­fered by the Chi­nese will help us ex­tract and process our abun­dant re­sources to the re­quired spec­i­fi­ca­tions which meet in­ter­na­tional stan­dards,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said he was happy that China is al­ready demon­strat­ing its com­mit­ment to help­ing Africa achieve th­ese ob­jec­tives through its Three Net­works and In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tive. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe called on African and Chi­nese gov­ern­ments to cre­ate en­abling en­vi­ron­ments which pro­mote net­work­ing, ex­change of ideas and making of tan­gi­ble deals to con­trib­ute to­wards boost­ing trade in a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial man­ner.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200724,Hu­man­ity de­feat­ing plagues,"Con­ta­gious pan­demics, plagues, pesti­lences are thou­sands of years old. they have been dev­as­tat­ing Mid­dle East­ern peo­ples in bib­li­cal times. the “Black Death” raged in me­dieval Europe. the Bubonic Plague (spread by fleas liv­ing in ro­dents) was brought by mer­chants to Europe from China via the Black sea. it killed be­tween 30% and 60 % of the pop­u­la­tion. Priests, monks and nuns vol­un­teered to nurse plague vic­tims, many get­ting in­fected them­selves and dy­ing to­gether with those they had been nurs­ing, eg, Luis gon­zaga (st aloysius), a Je­suit study­ing for the pri­est­hood who died in Rome in 1591. London was dev­as­tated in 1665 by the plague. over 100 000 peo­ple died of it, one in three in­hab­i­tants. tu­ber­cu­lo­sis (tB) was an in­fec­tious disease killing many writ­ers, artists, po­ets and saintly church peo­ple over many cen­turies. it also killed slum dwellers in poverty and squalor. the ger­man physi­cian Robert Koch dis­cov­ered the bacil­lus that caused tB in 1882. this made it pos­si­ble to de­velop vac­cines that would make tB cur­able. How­ever, tB is mu­tat­ing, and the de­vel­op­ment of new vac­cines is needed to de­feat the tB mu­ta­tions. they make tB a fa­tal disease, and peo­ple die of it even to­day (es­pe­cially in com­bi­na­tion with HiV and aids). im­me­di­ately af­ter World War i, from Feb­ru­ary 1918 un­til april 1920, the great in­fluenza (Flu) epi­demic raged, es­pe­cially in the united states. it killed 50 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide. Ebola was first found in west africa in De­cem­ber 2013, in Liberia and sierra Leone es­pe­cially. the se­vere acute Res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome, as­so­ci­ated with the coro­n­avirus started in 2002 in China. it in­fected 8 000 peo­ple world­wide, and 774 died of it. in 2004, the World Health or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHo) de­clared it over. Le­prosy was known in the time of Je­sus of nazareth, who healed lep­ers. Pre­vi­ously con­demned to live in to­tal iso­la­tion, they were now able to re­turn to their fam­i­lies. in the 19th cen­tury, Fa­ther Damien de Veuster (now saint Damien), a Belgian priest, lived with le­prosy pa­tients on the is­land of Molokai in the Pa­cific, got in­fected and died there. there used to be leper colonies in Zim­babwe, eg, Mutemwa near Mu­toko, where John Brad­burne, a Bri­tish vol­un­teer, lived with mostly cured le­prosy pa­tients un­til he got killed dur­ing the war of lib­er­a­tion. in the mean­time, a cure for the disease was found. My own fa­ther died of typhoid in a pris­oner of war camp in 1945. i ex­pe­ri­enced a po­lio epi­demic in Cologne/West ger­many in 1951. i re­mem­ber a very at­trac­tive 12-year-old girl from our neigh­bour­hood dy­ing of it. i was vac­ci­nated in time and suf­fered no harm. Po­lio sur­vivors tended to end up with de­formed limbs. i re­mem­ber also cholera and typhoid, aids and tB in Harare’s hos­pi­tals. i was not al­lowed to en­ter the wards, let alone to touch any pa­tients. stand­ing at the open door, we joined in prayer. Epi­demics have been part of human his­tory. there is our CoViD-19 pan­demic now, which we hope to de­feat even­tu­ally. Fran­tic ef­forts are un­der way to de­velop a vac­cine against the virus. there may be more pan­demics in the fu­ture. When we had Cyclone idai dev­as­tat­ing east­ern Zim­babwe and Mozam­bique in March last year, we said: “Let us pre­pare for the next dis­as­ter. Let us be ready.” Many peo­ple do not know how to re­act to such a pre­car­i­ous sit­u­a­tion. We must learn it now so that we beat the tiny, but vi­cious germs and save their vic­tims next time. our great ad­van­tage now is our vastly im­proved com­mu­ni­ca­tion sys­tem. When ger­man physi­cian Koch dis­cov­ered the tB bacil­lus in 1882, he could not eas­ily share the pos­i­tive re­sult of his re­search with col­leagues else­where in the coun­try, let alone over­seas. they had rail­ways then and ocean-go­ing steam ships which took many weeks from Europe to in­dia, from aus­tralia to Bri­tain. But that did not de­feat the global in­fec­tion. go­ing to Ja­pan some­times took a full year. there was no suez Canal yet, you had to go round the Cape of good Hope, stop at Mozam­bique is­land and wait for a trade wind to take you to goa. When i first lived in this coun­try, a let­ter to my fam­ily in Europe took two or more weeks. Wait­ing for an an­swer was an­other two weeks. to­day i write an e-mail in the morn­ing and with a bit of luck get an an­swer in the af­ter­noon. Dur­ing a pan­demic, stay­ing in touch with vic­tims is vi­tally im­por­tant. there is the phys­i­cal virus that is at­tack­ing the body and a spir­i­tual virus that is at­tack­ing the soul, there is phys­i­cal pain and spir­i­tual sor­row: phys­i­cal iso­la­tion and men­tal de­pres­sion. We may not be per­mit­ted to meet the sick brother or sis­ter, shake hands or give a hug, pay a visit or take a walk to­gether. We can­not reach out glob­ally to other con­ti­nents, or travel to for­eign parts where the disease has in­fected our friend or brother. But we are con­nected to peo­ple far away with so­cial me­dia, mo­bile phones, Skype or Zoom. We can ar­range for video con­fer­enc­ing or for e-mail let­ters and mes­sages. My cir­cle of friends who are ex­cluded from church ser­vices and so­cial events, re­ceive ev­ery week a mes­sage cir­cu­lated by e-mail. our tech­nol­ogy makes this pos­si­ble. the mes­sen­gers who first brought us the gospel, st Paul and st Fran­cis, Peter Cani­sius and Mary Ward, teresa of avila and Fran­cis Xavier, and all our spir­i­tual an­ces­tors, never stopped trav­el­ling. Even when sail­ing across the oceans they were still writ­ing heal­ing words to friends. i can­not say “good night” with­out hav­ing sent a greet­ing to a sick brother or sis­ter, by phone or by e-mail, in sick­ness or when re­cov­er­ing. the Bubonic Plague and pesti­lence, tu­ber­cu­lo­sis and in­fluenza, aids and coro­n­avirus were with us glob­ally. Maybe more will come. they are part of our lives. Have a con­sol­ing mes­sage for any­one in dis­tress. Friends plagued by disease are al­ways liv­ing in ex­pec­ta­tion, wait­ing for a sign of life. the med­i­cal ex­perts can­not al­low us ad­mit­tance to wards where they treat in­fected peo­ple. Masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing are cut­ting us off from the dear­est of our friends. But love and ten­der­ness can never be locked down or in­car­cer­ated. no one must be de­clared “in­com­mu­ni­cado”.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20201122,Pre­lim­i­nary im­pact of Covid-19 in Zim,"Across the globe, gov­ern­ments have re­sponded to the cri­sis in dif­fer­ent ways. The most com­mon re­sponse mea­sures, how­ever, have been the im­ple­men­ta­tion of fis­cal stim­u­lus pack­ages, com­plete or par­tial lock­downs and move­ment re­stric­tions, and the en­force­ment of ba­sic hy­giene prac­tices such as reg­u­lar hand wash­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Since the on­set of the pan­demic, the gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe has in­sti­tuted a num­ber of pol­icy, in­sti­tu­tional and op­er­a­tional mea­sures to com­bat and con­tain the pan­demic and re­duce its neg­a­tive im­pact, es­pe­cially on the poor and vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of so­ci­ety. Zim­babwe has a pro­jected pop­u­la­tion of 16,2 mil­lion, 52% of whom are fe­male and 67% live in ru­ral ar­eas. Nine per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion has a dis­abil­ity while life ex­pectancy was es­ti­mated at 60 years in 20173. The pop­u­la­tion is young with about 67% be­low the age of 35, with the 15-24 age group ac­count­ing for ap­prox­i­mately 36% of the pop­u­la­tion, and the un­der 15 year olds ac­count­ing for 77% of the pop­u­la­tion. This raises con­cern on the im­pact of the pan­demic on youth em­ploy­ment and ac­cess to ser­vices. As per the Zim­babwe de­mo­graphic pro­file, sex and age dis­ag­gre­gated data would be re­quired to iden­tify the most vul­ner­a­ble groups. On March 21, 2020 Zim­babwe be­gan a 21-day na­tional lock­down in a bid to com­bat the spread of the coro­n­avirus. This re­sulted in the shut­ting down of all ac­tiv­i­ties and ser­vices ex­cept those that were de­fined as es­sen­tial such as health care and law en­force­ment. This ini­tial lock­down was sub­se­quently ex­tended by an ad­di­tional two weeks. Sub­se­quent to that, on May 3, 2020, the lock­down was fur­ther ex­tended by another two weeks, but with more re­laxed pro­vi­sions. This al­lowed peo­ple to ease back into busi­ness while main­tain­ing the rec­om­mended safety guide­lines in­clud­ing manda­tory wear­ing of face masks and main­tain­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing. The in­for­mal sec­tor, how­ever, where a large pro­por­tion of women op­er­ate was and is still not open. On May 16, 2020, this sta­tus of af­fairs, that is re­lax­ation of lock­down mea­sures, was ex­tended in­def­i­nitely with a pro­viso for gov­ern­ment re­view ev­ery fort­night. On May 4, 2020, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced an am­bi­tious $18 bil­lion (ap­prox­i­mately US$720 mil­lion or nine per cent of Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct) eco­nomic stim­u­lus pack­age aimed at pro­vid­ing liq­uid­ity sup­port to the pro­duc­tive sec­tors of man­u­fac­tur­ing, agri­cul­ture, min­ing and tourism, while also tar­get­ing em­ploy­ment pro­tec­tion; re­cov­ery of mi­cro, small and medium en­ter­prises (MSMEs); strength­en­ing and ex­pan­sion of ex­ist­ing so­cial safety nets, in­clud­ing di­rect in­come sup­port for vul­ner­a­ble groups and in­di­vid­u­als; im­prove­ment of fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion through banks and mi­cro-fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions; and up­scal­ing in­vest­ments in eco­nomic and so­cial in­fra­struc­ture, while build­ing the re­silience of af­fected com­mu­ni­ties. This am­bi­tious pack­age rep­re­sented an im­prove­ment from an ear­lier pack­age un­veiled in April 2020 of $500 mil­lion (ap­prox­i­mately US$20 000 000) to help fight the pan­demic and ZWL$50 mil­lion (US$2 000 000) for med­i­cal aid, mostly for civil ser­vants on the front­line of the re­sponse. The ear­lier mea­sures also in­cluded ex­pen­di­ture re­struc­tur­ing away from cap­i­tal projects to health-re­lated ex­pen­di­tures; ring-fenc­ing of the 2% money trans­fer tax for so­cial pro­tec­tion and other pan­demic re­lated ex­pen­di­tures; $50 mil­lion (US$2 mil­lion) for ur­gent and im­me­di­ate im­por­ta­tion of health-re­lated sup­plies; im­me­di­ate hir­ing of over 4 000 health per­son­nel; $200 mil­lion (US$8 mil­lion) per month for a pe­riod of three months as cash trans­fers to an es­ti­mated one mil­lion vul­ner­a­ble house­holds; ex­pe­di­tious pro­cess­ing of value added and cor­po­rate tax re­funds; sus­pen­sion of cus­toms duty charge­able on Covid-19 med­i­cal sup­plies; re­view of pro­cure­ment rules to ex­pe­dite pur­chase of Covid-19 sup­plies; and sup­port for lo­cal in­dus­tries with ca­pac­ity to pro­duce ba­sic food stuffs and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. Zim­babwe as­pires to be­come a pros­per­ous and em­pow­ered up­per mid­dle-in­come coun­try (Up­per MIC) by 2030. The vi­sion is to be re­alised through the im­ple­men­ta­tion of three suc­ces­sive Strate­gic Pro­grammes: a Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) cov­er­ing the pe­riod Oc­to­ber 2018 to De­cem­ber 2020; and two suc­ces­sive Five-Year Devel­op­ment Strate­gies (NDSs) cov­er­ing the pe­ri­ods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030. As the TSP draws to a close, the gov­ern­ment has em­barked on the devel­op­ment of the first NDS for the 2021-2025 pe­riod. To date Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties for the pe­riod 2021-2025, as well as the Na­tional Devel­op­ment Re­sults Frame­work and Sec­toral Devel­op­ment Re­sults Frame­work are un­der con­sul­ta­tion. The NDS for­mu­la­tion process was of­fi­cially launched in April 2020 set­ting in mo­tion the process for fur­ther devel­op­ment and fine tun­ing of the Draft Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties crafted by Gov­ern­ment Tech­ni­cal Work­ing Group; es­tab­lish­ment of Sec­tor Spe­cific The­matic Work­ing Groups in line with Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties for NDS; and car­ry­ing Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) cov­er­ing the pe­riod Oc­to­ber 2018 to De­cem­ber 2020; and two suc­ces­sive Five-Year Devel­op­ment Strate­gies (NDSs) cov­er­ing the pe­ri­ods 2021-2025 and 2026-2030. As the TSP draws to a close, the gov­ern­ment has em­barked on the devel­op­ment of the first NDS for the 2021-2025 pe­riod. To date Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties for the pe­riod 2021 2025,6 as well as the Na­tional Devel­op­ment Re­sults Frame­work and Sec­toral Devel­op­ment Re­sults Frame­work are un­der con­sul­ta­tion. The NDS for­mu­la­tion process was of­fi­cially launched in April 2020 set­ting in mo­tion the process for fur­ther devel­op­ment and fine tun­ing of the Draft Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties crafted by Gov­ern­ment Tech­ni­cal Work­ing Group; es­tab­lish­ment of Sec­tor Spe­cific The­matic Work­ing Groups in line with Na­tional Pri­or­i­ties for NDS; and car­ry­ing out Na­tional Con­sul­ta­tions and draft­ing of NDS, which is tar­geted to be fi­nalised by the 4th Quar­ter of 2020. The pan­demic is likely to af­fect ev­ery sec­tor of the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy and all seg­ments of so­ci­ety but with dif­fer­en­tial im­pacts de­pend­ing on age group, gen­der, dis­abil­i­ties, so­cioe­co­nomic sta­tus, ge­o­graphic lo­ca­tion etc. In fact, pre-Covid-19, a large pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion (2,2 mil­lion peo­ple or 76%, many of whom are youths) were em­ployed in the in­for­mal econ­omy. With the lock­down and re­sult­ing job losses, we can an­tic­i­pate that the in­for­mal sec­tor will grow even larger. The need to en­sure that this group is tar­geted for sup­port is cru­cial, as an as­set for the devel­op­ment of the coun­try In an at­tempt to un­der­stand the po­ten­tial im­pact of the pan­demic on Zim­babwe, it is in­struc­tive to note that although it is pri­mar­ily a health cri­sis, it nonethe­less has far-reach­ing pub­lic gov­er­nance, so­cio-po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ram­i­fi­ca­tions. The AfDB-UN-WB con­sor­tium agreed to en­gage work­ing groups to up­date the pre­vi­ously con­ducted Joint Needs As­sess­ment to re­flect re­cent de­vel­op­ments in sup­port of the ap­proach pa­per pre­pared for the Na­tional Devel­op­ment Strat­egy. Hence, the UN so­cio-eco­nomic frame­work for Zim­babwe will not in­clude a sep­a­rate in-depth so­cio-eco­nomic as­sess­ment. How­ever, at the out­set of this framew use­ful to re­flect on a pre­lim­i­nary as­sess­ment of the im­pact of the pan­demic on the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy. Growth is likely to be de­pressed fur­ther: A sta­ble macro-eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment is a sine qua non for eco­nomic growth, in­vest­ments, job cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion. The IMF cur­rently es­ti­mates that Zim­babwe’s real GDP will con­tract by 7,4% in 2020. For a coun­try whose econ­omy con­tracted by an es­ti­mated 6,5% in 2019, con­tin­ued con­trac­tion of this mag­ni­tude, more so given the fragility of the econ­omy, would be dis­as­trous, dis­pro­por­tion­ately af­fect­ing the poor and vul­ner­a­ble, youth and young en­trepreneurs, small and in­for­mal busi­nesses, as well as small scale agri­cul­tural pro­duc­ers. De­layed im­ports of goods, es­pe­cially from China and South Africa, have led to short­ages of ba­sic con­sumer and in­ter­me­di­ate goods thus fu­elling in­fla­tion­ary pres­sures in the coun­try. Zim­babwe’s Na­tional Sta­tis­tics Agency (ZIMSTAT)10 in its April 2020 prices sur­vey high­lights that, in the twelve months to April 2020, av­er­age prices went up by 766 per­cent, the cost of food in­creased by 985%, while health costs rose by 1 049%. How­ever, other sub-cat­e­gories as ed­u­ca­tion and hous­ing, wa­ter and elec­tric­ity recorded low in­creases at 233% and 457%re­spec­tively and there­fore weigh­ing down on the over­all con­sumer price in­dex (CPI). Mean­while, month-on-month in­fla­tion eased to 17,6% down from 26,6% in March 2020. Con­sec­u­tive years of drought did not only af­fect lev­els of food se­cu­rity, it im­peded eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties which rely on hy­dropower, pro­duc­tion of which dropped to un­prece­dented lev­els. Although for­eign lend­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties may be lim­ited, Zim­babwe is likely to see a wors­en­ing debt sit­u­a­tion as GDP shrinks and debt-to-GDP ra­tio worsens. Ef­fects of lower oil prices are likely to be off­set by de­clin­ing Forex earn­ings: Zim­babwe re­lies heav­ily on fuel im­ports to meet her to­tal en­ergy de­mand. Crude oil Brent prices have de­clined sharply from US$69,6 per bar­rel on Jan­uary 5, 2020 to the cur­rent (May 6, 2020) price of US$25.52 per bar­rel, a 63% de­cline. Ex­ports of goods, mainly pri­mary com­modi­ties, which ac­counted for an es­ti­mated 22% of GDP in 2018 are ex­pected to be ad­versely af­fected by di­rect and in­di­rect link­ages with the global econ­omy, mainly China and Euro­pean Union (EU) coun­tries. China re­mains an im­por­tant des­ti­na­tion for Zim­bab­wean ex­ports, es­pe­cially tobacco, which is likely to be ad­versely af­fected by eco­nomic slow­down in that coun­try. The 2020 tobacco sea­son, which has re­cently started trad­ing is there­fore, ex­pected to see re­duced rev­enue this year. China is also an im­por­tant source of in­ter­me­di­ate goods for South Africa, Zim­babwe’s main trad­ing part­ner. Any slow­down in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in China will also af­fect the coun­try in­di­rectly via re­duced trade with South Africa. Mean­while, the Cham­ber of Mines of Zim­babwe es­ti­mated that min­eral pro­duc­tion could de­cline by 60% in the first quar­ter of 2020 alone, as com­pa­nies re­duce out­put due to dis­rup­tions in the sup­ply chain and lo­gis­tics. This could lead to a loss of US$400 mil­lion in rev­enues for the coun­try. De­pressed ac­tiv­i­ties in the min­ing sec­tor will also ad­versely af­fect forex rev­enue since min­er­als ac­count for at least one third of the coun­try’s forex earn­ings. De­cline in tourism and re­mit­tances will lead to re­duced forex earn­ings, job losses and ac­cess to ba­sic ser­vices. Tourism is a key sec­tor for Zim­babwe’s econ­omy, gen­er­at­ing an es­ti­mated US$1,4 bil­lion (3,3% of GDP) in rev­enue in 2018. Cur­rently, most of Zim­babwe’s tourism source coun­tries have is­sued travel re­stric­tions or are still in lock­down, re­sult­ing in the sus­pen­sion of tourism ac­tiv­ity. Fol­low­ing the start of Zim­babwe’s lock­down, ho­tels and tourist at­trac­tions shut down al­to­gether lead­ing to loss of in­come, which will, in­evitably, trans­late into job losses. The Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ZNCC) es­ti­mates that the tourism sec­tor will shed al­most 25% of to­tal jobs as a re­sult of the pan­demic. Zim­babwe also re­ceives an es­ti­mated US$1 bil­lion in re­mit­tances from its di­as­pora com­mu­nity an­nu­ally. Re­mit­tances are ex­pected to de­cline as coun­tries host­ing sig­nif­i­cant num­bers of Zim­babwe’s di­as­pora com­mu­nity, such as South Africa, are af­fected due to the cur­rent lock­down. • This is an ex­tract from a United Na­tions Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP) pa­per ti­tled: Im­me­di­ate So­cio-eco­nomic Re­sponse to Covid-19 in Zim­babwe (A Frame­work for In­te­grated Pol­icy Anal­y­sis and Sup­port) pub­lished on Novem­ber 13.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170907,JOBS & STUD­IES: AFRICA MUST MAX­IMISE BEN­E­FITS FROM CHI­NESE IN­VEST­MENT:,"CHINA has cat­a­pulted from be­ing a rel­a­tively small in­vestor in the con­ti­nent to be­com­ing Africa’s largest eco­nomic part­ner. Africa-China trade is poised to grow 20 per­cent year-on- year mak­ing it seem like dragons are the new king of the African jun­gle. In­vest­ment in Africa has, how­ever, been struc­tured around Chi­nese own­er­ship, with roughly 90 per­cent of firms ei­ther ma­jor­ity con­trolled or owned out­right by Chi­nese na­tion­als. There are es­ti­mated to be over 10 000 Chi­nese firms in Africa that have cre­ated work for sev­eral mil­lion Africans. This eco­nomic stim­u­lus con­tin­ues to have sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic im­pact in com­mu­ni­ties rid­dled with his­toric eco­nomic dis­par­i­ties. Chi­nese firms have shown re­mark­able prow­ess in sec­tors such as man­u­fac­tur­ing, re­sources, and in­fra­struc­ture. One of the first fa­mous ex­am­ples is the Tan­za­nia-Zam­bia Rail­way built be­tween 1970 and 1975, for which China pro­vided a zero-in­ter­est loan of RMB980 mil­lion ($150 mil­lion). Sec­tors in­clud­ing agri­cul­ture, bank­ing, in­surance, trans­port and lo­gis­tics, hous­ing, in­for­ma­tion com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions are poised to see sig­nif­i­cant shifts to Chi­nese firms. Chi­nese firms have the ben­e­fit of tried-and-tested busi­ness mod­els which bear great sim­i­lar­i­ties to the African mar­ket­place. To en­sure the sus­tain­abil­ity of the Africa-China part­ner­ship, three key con­cerns need to be ad­dressed: Cor­rup­tion, per­sonal safety, and lan­guage and cul­tural bar­ri­ers. Cor­rup­tion has thrived in Africa’s cur­rent cli­mate of po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic im­punity. Cor­rup­tion cre­ates and in­creases poverty and ex­clu­sion. While cor­rupt in­di­vid­u­als with deep po­lit­i­cal ties en­joy a lav­ish life, mil­lions of Africans are de­prived of their ba­sic needs like food, health, ed­u­ca­tion, hous­ing, ac­cess to clean wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion. Vi­o­lence and crime across the con­ti­nent de­rail ef­forts to en­cour­age com­mu­nity build­ing and for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. Lan­guage and cul­tural bar­ri­ers can lead to clashes that lead to mis­un­der­stand­ing and ig­no­rance of lo­cal reg­u­la­tions. If these prob­lems are left un­ad­dressed, the mis­un­der­stand­ings — and po­ten­tially se­ri­ous long-term so­cial is­sues — could weaken the over­all sus­tain­abil­ity of the Africa-China re­la­tion­ship. Chi­nese aid to Africa has been crit­i­cised as be­ing a form of eco­nomic coloni­sa­tion. Po­lit­i­cally aid has been used to cre­ate strong bi­lat­eral ties be­tween African coun­tries and China. Pro­po­nents high­light the struc­tural ben­e­fits brought about by aid; down­play­ing the ben­e­fits to China in the form of profit, re­source ex­trac­tion, and the ac­qui­si­tion of ser­vice con­tracts to Chi­nese com­pa­nies. In a nut­shell, which­ever coun­try of­fers the great­est eco­nomic gains based on China’s growth strat­egy be­comes a tar­get for aid. Cur­rently this strat­egy is geared to­wards part­ner­ing with re­source-rich coun­tries, which of­ten lack the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic struc­tures re­quired to ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively man­age such bi­lat­eral trade op­por­tu­ni­ties. The key chal­lenge is to en­sure that there is an ef­fec­tive po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic strat­egy to pig­gy­back off Chi­nese in­ter­ven­tion to en­sure broad based eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment. Part of this strat­egy should in­clude el­e­ments like build­ing a mid­dle class in Africa, de­vel­op­ing African en­trepreneurs, al­lo­cat­ing fac­tors of pro­duc­tion, in­dus­try 4,0, in­no­va­tive dis­tri­bu­tion, and pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships. The cur­rent eco­nomic po­lar­i­sa­tion in Africa needs to be ad­dressed by ac­tively cre­at­ing a mid­dles class. Clan-based eco­nomic feu­dal­ism needs to be re­placed by an ed­u­cated and eco­nom­i­cally en­gaged mid­dle class. Eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment in turn will pro­mote po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ment lead­ing to healthier in­ter­na­tional trade re­la­tions. En­trepreneur­ship, while still in its African in­fancy, has made sig­nif­i­cant strides both do­mes­ti­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally. Agri­cul­ture, man­u­fac­tur­ing, re­tail, and tourism can act as an em­ploy­ment sponge for ba­sic labour in­ten­sive work. While not a corner­stone em­ploy­ment strat­egy, it will lead to rapid, broad­based job cre­ation, of­ten re­quir­ing very ba­sic skill sets. Fur­ther vo­ca­tional train­ing can be pro­vided in these sec­tors to pre­vent gen­er­a­tional skills gaps. Ef­fec­tive al­lo­ca­tion of fac­tors of pro­duc­tion — specif­i­cally land own­er­ship — will be crit­i­cal. It’s a sen­si­tive sub­ject given Africa’s colo­nial past, how­ever it’s one gov­ern­ments need to ad­dress to start an am­bi­tious na­tional agri­cul­tural plan. The rapid growth of Africa’s pop­u­la­tion presents sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ties for our poul­try and grain sec­tor. In­dus­try 4,0 will make global man­u­fac­tur­ing much more com­pet­i­tive in the fu­ture. Tra­di­tional in­dus­trial economies, such as Ger­many and the United States, ex­pect the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion to cre­ate many com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages, re­vers­ing the trend to re­lo­cate man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses to low-cost coun­tries and cre­ate new high-tech op­por­tu­ni­ties at home. Africa is ideally po­si­tioned to leapfrog into In­dus­try 4,0 by adopt­ing best prac­tices seen in de­vel­oped coun­tries. This will en­able African-owned man­u­fac­tur­ers to ef­fec­tively com­pete with Chi­nese com­pa­nies. Africa is at the tip of an eco­nomic re­nais­sance that will see op­por­tu­ni­ties be­ing cre­ated that were con­sid­ered im­pos­si­ble a few decades ago. But, this re­quires strong lead­er­ship in both pol­i­tics and busi­ness. Cit­i­zens in turn will have to hold their po­lit­i­cal lead­ers ac­count­able, specif­i­cally pro­mot­ing broad-based eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment, to en­sure that the max­i­mum num­ber of peo­ple ben­e­fit from this growth. — Writ­ten by Jo­han Hanekom.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150510,Afro Asian lead­ers call for new devel­op­ment bank,"They ar­gued that the World Bank and the IMF can­not solve the world’s eco­nomic prob­lems, and “a new global eco­nomic or­der” must be built. Lead­ers of emerg­ing coun­tries in Africa and Asia have pushed for the estab­lish­ment of a new devel­op­ment bank to ri­val the World Bank. The new bank idea was dis­cussed dur­ing the 60th com­mem­o­ra­tion of the Asia-africa con­fer­ence last month in Jakarta, In­done­sia. The lead­ers agreed that, to suc­ceed, the bank must be to­tally sep­a­rated from the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) be­cause the two could no longer be trusted to fully fund devel­op­ment in­fra­struc­ture projects. Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe, who spoke at the con­fer­ence in his ca­pac­ity as the African Union (AU) leader and the South­ern African Devel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (Sadc) chair­per­son, said poli­cies fos­tered by the IMF and the World Bank had led to dein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and de­clin­ing in­come in sub­Sa­ha­ran Africa. Mu­gabe crit­i­cised both in­sti­tu­tions for “fail­ing to de­liver so­lu­tions” to al­le­vi­ate poverty, dis­trib­ute wealth and close the in­equal­ity gap in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. He said the two Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions were based on “West­ern doc­trine and ex­ploita­tion” and, as such, de­vel­op­ing coun­tries needed to look for al­ter­na­tives to se­cure their place in global af­fairs. “We see this by the de­ci­sion taken by Brics [Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa] coun­tries in es­tab­lish­ing a devel­op­ment bank and the es­tab­lish­ing of Asia In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank cham­pi­oned by China. This is how we must forge ahead if the voice of the South is go­ing to mat­ter in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs,” said Mu­gabe. Last year Brics launched a devel­op­ment bank. Its main ob­jec­tive is to mo­bilise re­sources for in­fra­struc­ture and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment projects for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The bank will, among other things, sup­port public or pri­vate projects through loans, guar­an­tees, eq­uity par­tic­i­pa­tion and other fi­nan­cial in­stru­ments. Mu­gabe said the devel­op­ment of th­ese banks would usher in a new world eco­nomic or­der that would fo­cus on South-south co-op­er­a­tion and make de­vel­op­ing coun­tries self-suf­fi­cient. In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo shared the same sen­ti­ments, say­ing African and Asian coun­tries felt a global injustice be­cause the de­vel­oped world is re­luc­tant to change the sta­tus quo. “The view that the world eco­nomic prob­lems can only be solved by the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund is an out­dated view. I am of the view that the man­age­ment of the global econ­omy can­not be left only to th­ese in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. We must build a new global eco­nomic or­der that is open to new emerg­ing eco­nomic pow­ers,” Wi­dodo said. He said the rich na­tions, which house only 20% of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, con­sume more than 70% of re­sources and hun­dreds en­joy the lives of the su­per-rich, yet more than 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple in the south­ern hemi­sphere strug­gled and lived on less than $2 a day. Wi­dodo lauded China for es­tab­lish­ing the Asia In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank, the head­quar­ters of which will be in Bei­jing, China. It will fi­nance trans­port, wa­ter, en­ergy and in­fra­struc­ture projects in that re­gion. Ken­neth Creamer, an econ­o­mist at the School of Eco­nomic and Busi­ness Sciences at the Uni­ver­sity of Wit­wa­ter­srand, said there had been some re­sis­tance from the United States to the estab­lish­ment of the bank. He said it was an ini­tia­tive to be ap­plauded and that time would tell whether it would rise to the chal­lenge. Creamer said the Asia In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank could play a cru­cial role in fi­nanc­ing much-needed in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments in both con­ti­nents. He said, if the bank was to work ef­fec­tively in as­sist­ing Africa to over­come its short­age of so­cial and eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture, it would have to com­bine Asia’s fi­nan­cial mus­cle with the skills and ex­pe­ri­ence that were al­ready on the con­ti­nent, such as those of the African Devel­op­ment Bank and the Devel­op­ment Bank of South­ern Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200926,Shop­ping craze beats bor­der clo­sures,"THINK of the bil­lions of dol­lars that global on­line shop­ping plat­forms like Alibaba and Ama­zon have made since the world shut down due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic from around March to date! With vir­tu­ally all the coun­tries shut­ting down their bor­ders to hu­man traf­fic soon af­ter WHO de­clared the coro­n­avirus out­break a global pan­demic, on­line shop­ping plat­forms have be­come the new nor­mal as cit­i­zens seek a safer way of procur­ing goods. While na­tions shut their bor­ders to hu­man traf­fic, com­mer­cial cargo has been al­lowed across trad­ing part­ners thereby pro­vid­ing a global life­line to the smooth flow of trade. Lo­cal in­for­mal small traders who had thrived on cross bor­der trade with pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tions of choice like South Africa, Tan­za­nia, Botswana, China, Turkey and Zam­bia were threat­ened with to­tal an­ni­hi­la­tion by the clo­sure of bor­ders as they de­pended on reg­u­lar phys­i­cal move­ment to move their goods. Sud­denly, hun­dreds of thou­sands of fam­i­lies that sur­vived on the mostly re­gional cross bor­der trade faced un­cer­tainty as bor­der shut­downs threat­ened their source of liveli­hood. Quick think­ing and busi­ness in­ge­nu­ity has seen lo­cal cross bor­der traders open­ing a whole new source of liveli­hood for them­selves which has also cre­ated op­por­tu­ni­ties for other in­for­mal smaller ser­vice providers like money trans­fer agen­cies and trans­port op­er­a­tors who oth­er­wise would have to com­pete with estab­lished ones. The new cross bor­der shop­ping craze with a whole new vo­cab­u­lary and a way of con­duct­ing busi­ness has taken over and is now sus­tain­ing fam­i­lies who at one time faced hunger and poverty. “Our small cross bor­der trade busi­nesses were al­most wiped out by the on­set of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Thank God, our in­ge­nu­ity has helped us cre­ate a whole new way of do­ing busi­ness. Through the use of our busi­ness net­works in coun­tries where we source our wares, we have started a new way of trad­ing. We source for busi­ness or­ders lo­cally and then con­tact our for­eign based con­tacts whom we call run­ners in ei­ther South Africa, Botswana, Turkey, Tan­za­nia or Zam­bia, de­pend­ing on what the clients want, shop for the items and ship them via cross bor­der haulage trucks or small truck driv­ers,” ex­plained Ngo­nidza­she who is a lawyer and runs a small cross bor­der cloth­ing re­tail busi­ness. She ex­plained that traders use so­cial me­dia plat­forms like What­sApp to cre­ate groups of po­ten­tial clients through which or­ders are then made. Goods that are on de­mand in­clude car parts, gro­ceries, fur­ni­ture, kitchen uten­sils and cloth­ing. “I cre­ated a What­sApp group I named Glo­ria’s Closet with con­tacts from my mo­bile phone. I have busi­ness con­tacts in South Africa, Botswana, China and Turkey through whom I place my clients’ or­ders. I send them money us­ing a lo­cal net­work of in­for­mal money trans­fer agen­cies whose rates are af­ford­able for small traders like my­self who can­not af­ford the big cor­po­rate money trans­fer agen­cies,” said Ngo­nidza­she. She ex­plained that she uses What­sApp groups to ad­ver­tise new prod­ucts. “I use on­line pic­tures to ad­ver­tise my prod­ucts on var­i­ous What­sApp groups. The clo­sure of the bor­ders as en­sured that clients now rely on peo­ple like my­self to buy stuff across bor­ders. I some­times get over­whelmed by or­ders and that frus­trates me as I fail to mo­bilise enough money to place or­ders to meet the de­mand.” She ex­plained that the in­for­mal money trans­fer agen­cies charge as lit­tle as 50 rand to trans­fer amounts that are less than US$100. Any­thing above US$100 is sent for free. The catch though is that the money trans­fer agen­cies, who are street money chang­ers who have rein­vented them­selves make a killing from tak­ing only US dol­lars which are then trans­ferred to South Africa as rands. They make their money through the fluc­tu­at­ing rand against dol­lar rate. “If I want to send money to my run­ner in South Africa, I go to my reg­u­lar money trans­fer agent who runs bank ac­counts in South Africa and he sim­ply trans­fers the amount to my run­ner’s bank and within sec­onds, I get my proof of pay­ment and my run­ner con­firms re­ceipt of pay­ment. Ob­vi­ously my money trans­fer agent has his own cross bor­der net­work which he uses. The whole busi­ness is run on trust. You can­not af­ford to cheat in this busi­ness. And we work on re­fer­rals to build that trust.” The busi­ness is run on trust, she said she some­times asks her clients to pay a de­posit when they place their or­ders which also helps her to meet the de­mand. “When clients place their or­ders, I some­times ask them to pay a cer­tain amount as de­posit. We work on trust and no cheat­ing is per­mit­ted in this busi­ness. Cheats are ruth­lessly dealt with. We pro­tect the in­tegrity of our busi­nesses be­cause that’s our ma­jor source of liveli­hood. Why would I put a source of liveli­hood of thou­sands of fam­i­lies in dan­ger by cheat­ing? No, we don’t cheat,” she em­pha­sised. She said their busi­ness is an epit­ome of where cus­tomer is king as they aim to please their clients. “In this busi­ness, you can­not af­ford to quar­rel with a cus­tomer. Word trav­els very fast and you don’t want a neg­a­tive rep­u­ta­tion as this may drive away po­ten­tial cus­tomers.” She ex­plained that be­cause their busi­ness strictly op­er­ates on trust, dis­hon­esty is ruth­lessly dealt with and se­vere pun­ish­ment is meted on those found on the wrong side of their ethics. One of the money trans­fer agents de­clined an in­ter­view, in­sist­ing that he doesn’t want to dis­close his trade se­crets! An­other cross bor­der trader who de­clined iden­ti­fi­ca­tion ex­plained that run­ners charge fees of be­tween 15-20 per­cent of the to­tal amount of or­ders. “They (run­ners) also charge a sep­a­rate amount for trans­port. When a run­ner pro­cures the or­ders we send, she/he then packs the parcels and sends them via small cross bor­der truck driv­ers. Cross bor­der haulage busi­ness has al­ways been dom­i­nated by big haulage trucks. Since the bor­der clo­sures, smaller trucks suited for our small or­ders have taken over busi­ness that used to go to cross bor­der buses,” he ex­plained. He said the friend­lier and faster the driver is in de­liv­er­ing or­ders, the more money he/ she makes. “We are a busi­ness that op­er­ates on trust, friend­li­ness and ef­fi­ciency, we frown upon those who op­er­ate dis­hon­estly. In fact, we se­verely pun­ish of­fend­ers. I will not dis­close how we do it, but I can as­sure you, dis­hon­esty is pun­ished.” Goods pro­cured within the re­gion usu­ally take four to five days to land while those from China and Turkey some­times take up to a week if they are sent through run­ners in South Africa. “It is cheaper to send goods from Turkey through South Africa than to send di­rectly to Zimbabwe. While it would take three days for goods from Turkey to land in Harare, it is also a lit­tle more ex­pen­sive. So, you will find most goods from that coun­try are sent via South Africa and will take at most six days to land. “Run­ners also have their net­works. If one has an or­der for goods that are found in say, Turkey, your reg­u­lar run­ner usu­ally li­aises with their coun­ter­part in that coun­try and the goods are shipped. Th­ese days I am get­ting more or­ders for goods that are found in Turkey. Costs of procur­ing from far away coun­tries are a lit­tle higher, but that has not stopped the or­ders from com­ing in.” Or­ders nor­mally ar­rive on Fri­days and pop­u­lar of­fload­ing bays are found at Mbudzi Round About, Machip­isa and High Glen Shop­ping Cen­tre in Harare. The parcels are fu­mi­gated be­fore dis­patch. By the end of the day, the run­ner, money trans­fer agent and the cross bor­der trader have made their money while the cus­tomer is sat­is­fied as he/she gets his/her goods.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161228,How China be­came the dar­ling of Africa,"None­the­less, as Amer­i­can and Bri­tish pop­ulists pre­pare to close their doors to the out­side world, and as West­ern in­flu­ence dims across the con­ti­nent, China may well be the cat­a­lyst Africa has re­quired to leap for­ward into the fu­ture. AD­DIS Ababa has a sur­prise in store for those who haven’t vis­ited in two years. Cut­ting through the heart of this boom­ing city, where con­struc­tion cranes are the most per­sis­tent fea­ture of the sky­line, is the Ad­dis Ababa Light Rapid Tran­sit (AALRT) net­work. It rears up sud­denly at Meskel Square, which un­til 2013 gazed out onto an ex­panse of chaotic traf­fic. The traf­fic now bus­tles be­neath the shadow of what is only the sec­ond metro ever built south of the Sa­hara. On the back of the green and white trains that trun­dle up and down the line are not one, but two lo­gos: the Ethiopian Rail­ways Cor­po­ra­tion, and, next to it, the logo of the gi­ant state-owned China Rail­way Group (CREC). How did China get in­volved in de­vel­op­ing an African metropo­lis that Western­ers tend to as­so­ciate with famine and death? And this is just one project among many across the con­ti­nent. In 2014 alone, China signed more than £56 bil­lion in con­struc­tion con­tracts across Africa. Since the turn of the cen­tury, Chi­nese firms have built sta­di­ums, high­ways, air­ports, schools, hospi­tals and, in An­gola, an en­tire city. China has pumped hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars into African govern­ments and in­fra­struc­ture. In re­turn, it has reaped hun­dreds of bil­lions in com­modi­ties. Why does it still take so long to drive across Africa? Few in Africa are cer­tain that there is fair quid pro quo at play here. Is this the dawn of a new colo­nial­ism, they won­der, a new scram­ble for Africa in which the con­ti­nent is once again left in tat­ters? Or is it the be­gin­ning of an era dur­ing which Africans shake off old colo­nial mas­ters and look else­where for di­rect investment and aid? The Light Rail­way goes some way to an­swer­ing th­ese ques­tions. The project dates back to De­cem­ber 2011 when the idea for a 34,25km elec­tri­fied light rail­way se­cured funds from Exim Bank of China. Con­struc­tion for the 39-sta­tion project be­gan in 2013 and the metro opened in Septem­ber 2015, well ahead of sched­ule. The line has cost $475 mil­lion, 85 per­cent of which was loaned by Chi­nese pol­icy banks or en­ter­prises. The project was a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween CREC and the Ethiopian Rail­ways Cor­po­ra­tion, the junior part­ner, while the Shen­zen Metro Group and CREC will serve as op­er­a­tions man­agers for the next five years un­til a planned han­dover to the lo­cal rail au­thor­i­ties. The metro moves about 15 000 peo­ple per line per day and costs about six birr a ride. But de­scrib­ing it as an out­right suc­cess would be a stretch. The con­struc­tion of­ten looks slap­dash - a stan­dard com­plaint about Chi­nese con­struc­tion projects across the con­ti­nent. At St Est­fanos sta­tion, an empty USAID wheat sack serves as a garbage bag. This serves as a neat anal­ogy of the com­pet­ing in­ter­ests in Ethiopia, and also of the dif­fer­ent ap­proaches. For the West, the coun­try has al­ways been a bas­ket case, or al­ter­na­tively, a bul- wark against Is­lamist ex­trem­ism. For the Chi­nese, it rep­re­sents a vast, un­tapped mar­ket: a coun­try of al­most 100 mil­lion peo­ple, 90 per­cent of whom are un­banked, primed to roar through the re­main­der of the cen­tury as a force in Africa, and be­yond. The be­gin­ning of a “win-win” re­la­tion­ship? In 1971, dur­ing the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion, a young Chi­nese man called Gau “Vic­tor” Hau had just fin­ished a two-year stretch in an agri­cul­tural re-ed­u­ca­tion camp. His first as­sign­ment from the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party was in Tan­za­nia as a trans­la­tor on the most size­able and im­por­tant project ever un­der­taken by the Mid­dle King­dom on for­eign soil. Now Gau is a ca­reer rail­way ad­viser for the mas­sive State-owned en­tity, China Rail­way Con­struc­tion Cor­po­ra­tion Lim­ited (CRCC). But in 1971 his abil­ity to speak English was cru­cial to a huge rail­way project planned be­tween Tan­za­nia and Zam­bia. In the late 1960s, Chair­man Mao and the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) had en­tered into an agree­ment with Tan­za­nian lib­er­a­tion hero Julius Ny­erere and his Zam­bian con­tem­po­rary Ken­neth Kaunda. They would build a rail­way line from the Tan­za­nian port city of Dar es Salaam to Kapiri Mposhi, lo­cated in Zam­bia’s Cop­per­belt. For Kaunda, the rail­way was an ex­is­ten­tial ne­ces­sity: sur­rounded by white su­prem­a­cist regimes in Rhode­sia and South Africa, there was no way for him to ex­port his pri­mary re­source to the sea. Hence, the Uhuru (Kiswahili for “free­dom”) Rail­way. For the CPC, the project was no less vi­tal. Prior to rap­proche­ment with the Nixon ad­min­is­tra­tion in 1972, and dur­ing Mao’s lengthy en­mity with the Soviet Union, China was sub­ject to diplo­matic pur­dah. To se­cure enough votes to be­come re­in­stated on the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, Bei­jing re­quired al­lies, and hoped to find the nec­es­sary sup­port in Africa. The Tan­za­nia-Zam­bia Rail­way Au­thor­ity (Tazara) line, to be paid for in full by the Chi­nese, was the be­gin­ning of what Bei­jing promised would be a “win-win re­la­tion­ship”, a kin­ship based on mu­tual need to fend off shared an­tag­o­nisms. But there was a sec­ond, per­haps even more prag­matic, rea­son to build the rail­way. “We have to rely on im­port­ing nat­u­ral re­sources from other coun­tries,” Gau said, seated be­hind a desk in his large Bei­jing of­fice. “If China was to keep up sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment for many years, China has to se­cure a sup­ply of nat­u­ral re­sources and min­er­als to feed our in­dus­tries.” Tazara, with a $400 mil­lion price tag, was blind­ingly ex­pen­sive, es­pe­cially for a coun­try mired in poverty and still reel­ing from the chaos of Chair­man Mao’s rev­o­lu­tion­ary ex­er­tions. Gau says the rail­way’s real cost was likely $1 bil­lion (at least $6 bil­lion in to­day’s money), with a fur­ther $1 bil­lion in main­te­nance over the years. It was an im­mensely dif­fi­cult en­gi­neer­ing chal­lenge. The track cut through 1 860km of bush and moun­tain ranges, with more than 300 bridges, 22 tun­nels, 96 sta­tions, and about 400 000 sq m of sup­port struc­tures. Al­most 50 000 Chi­nese en­gi­neers, trans­la­tors, project man­agers and labour­ers were con­tracted to the project, with a fur­ther 100 000 Zam­bian and Tan­za­ni­ans fill­ing out the work­force. All of this was funded by China with an in­ter­est-free loan, to be paid back over 30 years, with a 10-year grace pe­riod.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200526,Don’t si­lence cit­i­zens: Chamisa,"OP­PO­SI­TION MDC Al­liance leader Nel­son Chamisa yes­ter­day called on African lead­ers to stop si­lenc­ing cit­i­zens and un­der­min­ing hu­man rights and democ­racy as the con­ti­nent com­mem­o­rated Africa Day. His call came as hu­man rights de­fend­ers voiced con­cern over the gross vi­o­la­tions of civil and po­lit­i­cal rights by se­cu­rity forces. Rights groups said Zim­babwe was a li­a­bil­ity to Africa as it lagged be­hind in the peace and de­vel­op­ment agenda as en­shrined in the African Char­ter on Hu­man and Peo­ple’s Rights. Speak­ing to News­Day, Chamisa said Africa was tired of dic­ta­tor­ship and it was now time to end the cri­sis and build a united Africa. “In­stead of si­lenc­ing the guns, we see there is con­certed ef­fort to si­lence the cit­i­zen and also to si­lence al­ter­na­tive voices and to si­lence the vote,” he said. “In Africa we must not have the bul­let con­trol­ling the bal­lot. Pol­i­tics must guide the gun. The gun must not dic­tate pol­i­tics. The gun in pol­i­tics is not just the gun in the bar­rack, it is also the gun of poverty, guns of drought, guns of ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lence and the guns of trib­al­ism. There are also guns of elec­tion rig­ging that have af­fected Africa.” Chamisa said there was need for part­ner­ship and no need for ex­ploita­tion in a united Africa. “We need a strong vi­sion, not the di­vi­sions we have in Africa. We need to deal with the is­sue of en­trepreneur­ship and have in­dus­tries so that we don’t ex­port raw ma­te­ri­als,” he said. “We must stop the merry go round business of chang­ing rid­ers without chang­ing the ride. We have had Europe as a rider, now we have China as a rider. That can­not con­tinue.” Three MDC Al­liance youth lead­ers, Joanah Mamombe, Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment for Harare West and two of her col­leagues, Net­sai Marova and Ce­cilia Chim­biri were re­cently ab­ducted by sus­pected State se­cu­rity agents af­ter a flash demon­stra­tion in Harare and were phys­i­cally and sex­u­ally abused. Two jour­nal­ists, Frank Chikowore and Sa­muel Takawira were ar­rested on Fri­day while try­ing to in­ter­view the three and were charged with al­legedly dis­obey­ing an or­der from a police of­fi­cer. On his part, Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa in his Africa Day mes­sage, said the con­ti­nent must con­tinue to en­joy and con­sol­i­date democ­racy and good gov­er­nance. “We must con­tinue to con­sol­i­date and deepen the cul­ture of democ­racy and good gov­er­nance be­queathed on us by our found­ing fa­thers. We can’t be taught democ­racy by those coun­tries that un­leashed colonialism against us. We are our own lib­er­a­tors,” he said. In her Africa Day mes­sage, MDC-T leader Thokozani Khupe said po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity re­mains a key chal­lenge in Africa that is al­ready reel­ing from the cri­sis of un­em­ploy­ment, un­der­de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic in­sta­bil­ity. For­mer min­is­ter and Zanu PF na­tional com­mis­sar Saviour Ka­sukuwere called for one­ness in Africa adding that lead­ers who take pride in per­se­cut­ing op­po­nents were “out­dated”. “Bully vil­lagers should re­alise that to mur­der, in­jure, per­se­cute and jail your op­po­nents is as out­dated as Nazism and colonialism. Dif­fer­ences of opinion should never be a ba­sis for the up­root­ing of an­other child from the vil­lage. Let us re­solve dis­putes through di­a­logue with no blood­shed. Let us sit down and un­der the African moon, thrash the dif­fer­ences and af­firm to­gether,” Ka­sukuwere said. Zim­babwe Hu­man Rights NGO Fo­rum in its Africa Day state­ment yes­ter­day said many in Zim­babwe are yet to live the prom­ise of the Con­sti­tu­tion. “As Zim­babwe and the con­ti­nent com­mem­o­rate Africa Day, Zim­babwe re­mains be­hind in Africa’s peace and de­vel­op­ment agenda, slow­ing down the ad­vance­ment of its peo­ples and be­com­ing a li­a­bil­ity to African as a whole,” the NGO Fo­rum said in a state­ment. “In spite of the align­ment of val­ues and aspi­ra­tions in the AU’s frame­work of prin­ci­ples and in the Con­sti­tu­tion of Zim­babwe, many in Zim­babwe are yet to see, ex­pe­ri­ence and live the prom­ise of the Con­sti­tu­tion.” ZimRights slammed State-sanc­tioned ab­duc­tions and vi­o­lence against women. “It must be noted that the day, which is sup­posed to be a mo­ment of cel­e­brat­ing our African­ness, and the val­ues that bind us as a con­ti­nent, is coming at a time when the coun­try is in the mid­dle of a storm of what ap­pears to be State­sanc­tioned ab­duc­tions of op­po­si­tion party lead­ers and vi­o­lence against women,” ZimRights said. The African Union agenda 2063 en­vi­sions a con­ti­nent where a univer­sal cul­ture of good gov­er­nance, demo­cratic val­ues, gen­der equal­ity, and re­spect for hu­man rights, jus­tice and the rule of law sub­sists. Zim­babwe sub­scribes to the African Char­ter on Hu­man and Peo­ple’s Rights. The Zim­babwe Lawyers for Hu­man Rights (ZLHR) in a state­ment ex­pressed con­cern “at the use of ex­ces­sive force against un­armed civil­ians by se­cu­rity sec­tors play­ers, the con­tin­ued per­pe­tra­tion with im­punity of gross vi­o­la­tions of civil and po­lit­i­cal rights. Equally dis­turb­ing is the lack of pri­ori­ti­sa­tion and pro­vi­sion of ad­e­quate re­sources to en­sure the pro­gres­sive re­al­i­sa­tion of so­cial and eco­nomic rights”. ZLHR said there was lack of po­lit­i­cal will by the govern­ment to ful­fil the vol­un­tary com­mit­ments made at the con­ti­nen­tal level. Africa Day was com­mem­o­rated un­der the theme Si­lenc­ing the guns in Africa by 2020.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20200816,The great be­trayal of Robert Mu­gabe,"MY Dear Peo­ple, It is now of­fi­cial! The last­ing legacy of land dis­tri­bu­tion by the great rev­o­lu­tion­ary Robert Mu­gabe is be­ing for­mally dis­man­tled by those who worked with him for years. What is even more tragic is that the pro­gramme to de­stroy Gushungo’s legacy is be­ing led by the gov­ern­ment of his for­mer spe­cial as­sis­tant and body­guard, Ng­wena. Maybe we need a new law to say for­mer spe­cial as­sis­tants and body guards should not be­come pres­i­dents of any se­ri­ous coun­try. I mean what would body­guards know about manag­ing coun­tries other than the use of brute force against cit­i­zens. Cu­ri­ously, an anal­y­sis of the short history of the sec­ond repub­lic as they call it, re­veals a path strewn with dead bod­ies, bro­ken bones and many ab­duc­tions. That is what hap­pens when some gang­sters, mafia, al­lu­vial gold deal­ers, clue­less politi­cians and the junta sud­denly find them­selves in po­si­tions of power and author­ity. Sadly, while the junta be­lieves in their com­mand pol­i­tics of bush jus­tice and ret­ri­bu­tion, which was used in the jun­gles of Mozam­bique, Tan­za­nia and Zam­bia, the rest of the world is mov­ing on. But I di­gress. Back to the is­sue of dis­man­tling Mu­gabe’s legacy. So the gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe is go­ing to pay com­pen­sa­tion for “de­vel­op­ments” made on farms by for­mer com­mer­cial farm­ers? Fools! Id­iots! Munopenga! Gushungo would not have al­lowed that to hap­pen! Ng­wena’s gov­ern­ment is do­ing all that in or­der to please the Bri­tish and Euro­peans. He wants to be re-ad­mit­ted into the Com­mon­wealth so that he can drink tea with Queen El­iz­a­beth. If for some rea­son Zim­babwe is re-ad­mit­ted into the Com­mon­wealth, I am sure they can al­ways en­sure that Ng­wena does not bring his gar­ish and vul­gar scarf to the sum­mit. But then, a lot of ec­cen­tric char­ac­ters from our moth­er­land al­ways rock up at such sum­mits in all man­ner of at­tire and strange be­hav­iour. While Zim­babwe can of­fer ED and his colourful scarf, Uganda won’t be too far with their pres­i­dent, Yow­eri Kaguta Mu­sev­eni and his hunter’s hel­met and over­sized suits. For­mer Libyan leader Muam­mar Gaddafi at one time fa­mously ar­rived for a Non-Aligned Move­ment (NAM) with sev­eral camels, which he would milk in the morn­ing be­fore tea. Of course, all three men­tioned above had very strong history with the mil­i­tary, in fact, all three seized power through coups. Again on the is­sue of pleas­ing Euro­peans by pay­ing for de­vel­op­ments made on farms, we ask how those de­vel­op­ments were made. Was it not on the ba­sis of forced or poorly paid labour that they were able to have those de­vel­op­ments. What about indigenous fam­i­lies that were moved from fer­tile soils and dumped in the poor sandy soils of tribal trust lands in malaria in­fested ar­eas and forced into poverty and death. Does it mean this gov­ern­ment will soon be com­pen­sat­ing the Bri­tish set­tlers for colo­nial­ism? For the thou­sands of Zim­bab­weans, who suf­fered and died in the fight for in­de­pen­dence to free the coun­try from colo­nial and set­tler bondage, this must be the great­est be­trayal and sell out ac­tiv­ity by the rul­ing elite. As they used to say in the bush: “Pasi nevaten­gesi!” Un­for­tu­nately, as in An­i­mal Farm, the rul­ing elite are ex­pos­ing their sell out and cor­rupt ten­den­cies by try­ing to re­turn to the old or­der. It will not be sur­pris­ing to hear an of­fi­cial state­ment sug­gest­ing that as a way of help­ing to fight sanc­tions, we need to re­name our coun­try Rhode­sia and that our cap­i­tal city re­verts to good old Sal­is­bury. And while at it, the of­fi­cial state­ment could also add that ci­ties such as Hart­ley, Um­tali, Ga­tooma, Fort Vic­to­ria, Que Que and Gwelo shall re­vert to their old names. What is in Kanyemba? We have al­ways asked just what it is that is hap­pen­ing in Kanyemba. Other than the usual baloney and of­fi­cial plat­i­tudes about de­vel­op­ing the area to en­sure food se­cu­rity and de­velop tourism, what is at­tract­ing the at­ten­tion of the own­ers of the coun­try? Vice-Pres­i­dent Dhib­hir­i­tat­ing has an un­usual in­ter­est in Kanyemba. It re­mains his most vis­ited area, well, af­ter China. Any­way, let us con­tinue to fol­low de­vel­op­ments as other public of­fi­cials are also re­port­edly eye­ing real es­tate in Kanyemba. Dead BC He­roes To­day I would like to pay a spe­cial trib­ute to the many he­roes and hero­ines at Dead BC tele­vi­sion. They have done a good job in ex­pos­ing some se­nior gov­ern­ment and rul­ing Zanu PF of­fi­cials, who can’t do ba­sic things like prop­erly wear­ing their fa­cial masks. Our he­roes have al­lowed them to speak on cam­era with­out alert­ing them that their masks are not prop­erly po­si­tioned. The lat­est joke was on Dou­glous Mahiya, who ap­peared on tele­vi­sion while wear­ing a face mask fash­ioned out of his beloved Zanu PF cloth ma­te­rial. Of course, no­body warned him be­fore the in­ter­view that the mask was in­side out and up­side down! Watch­ing the bliss­fully un­aware Mahiya go­ing on and on made for a good laugh.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200527,AU: 57 years of run­ning stand­still,"FOR 57 years, African lead­ers have re­peated the same call with­out im­ple­ment­ing it. “We must unite or per­ish ... We must recog­nise that our eco­nomic in­de­pen­dence re­sides in our African Union and re­quires the same con­cen­tra­tion upon the po­lit­i­cal achieve­ment.” The above quote, the unini­ti­ated may not know when and where it was de­liv­ered. It was de­liv­ered by Ghana's found­ing fa­ther Nk­wame Nkrumah on May 25, 1963 in Ad­dis Ababa, Ethiopia, at the found­ing of Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity now the African Union (AU). On Mon­day, the con­ti­nent com­mem­o­rated the found­ing of the con­ti­nen­tal union, but in re­al­ity Africa is still far away from be­ing a proper union. For the past 57 years, Africa has largely re­mained where it was in 1963. It is note­wor­thy that African States over the years have been try­ing to re­alise the dream that was laid in Ad­dis Ababa in 1963. How­ever, the dream is more like ap­proach­ing a hori­zon — the more you walk to­wards it the fur­ther it moves away. Over the years, Africa has di­vided it­self into re­gional eco­nomic blocs — Sadc, EAC, Ecowas and Me­grab in the north. For some rea­son, the re­gional blocs have largely fol­lowed the di­vi­sions of colo­nial­ism. South­ern and eastern Africa were largely Bri­tish colonies while west Africa was Fran­co­phone and north Africa was Ital­ian and Ara­bic. Thus in sim­ple terms, Africa has sim­ply re­mained di­vided as it was since the 1880's dur­ing the Ber­lin Con­fer­ence. The con­ti­nent has the mis­for­tune of hav­ing a lead­er­ship that en­tirely de­pends on pro­cras­ti­na­tion, mir­a­cles and more bluntly that things will take care of them­selves. Un­like the 1963 lead­er­ship, Africa has had clue­less and self-cen­tred lead­ers there­after. The new lead­ers be­sides chang­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion's name to AU, they have un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally put a plan to achieve full African unity and de­vel­op­ment in the year 2063 — a good cen­tury after the for­ma­tion of the union. The plan chris­tened vi­sion 2063 has largely re­mained a dream that no one has put an ef­fort to make it a re­al­ity. It re­mains a plan funded by for­eign pow­ers and for the ben­e­fit of Euro­peans or the new global power China. And it sounds more like Wal­ter Rod­ney's fa­mous quote in his sem­i­nal book — How Europe Un­der­de­vel­oped Africa: “All roads and rail­ways led to the sea."" Africa to a great ex­tent has re­mained largely de­pen­dent on ex­port­ing raw com­modi­ties to the world. These com­modi­ties are min­er­als and agri­cul­tural prod­ucts — a poor eco­nomic model that is cen­tred on a mar­ket in which the con­ti­nent is only a seller. One can imag­ine the London Bullion Mar­ket for gold or the Brus­sels Di­a­mond Cen­tre, yet these two coun­tries have no sig­nif­i­cant pro­duc­tion of the same min­er­als. It is at this junc­ture im­por­tant to ques­tion why African lead­ers have not read and un­der­stood Frantz Fanon's book — The Wretched of the Earth. Fanon says in­de­pen­dent African States should cre­ate a na­tional bour­geoisie class — lo­cal in­dus­tri­al­ists and man­u­fac­tur­ers — if they needed to de­velop. How­ever, the con­ti­nent's rich are still mere mid­dle­men — whole­salers. African lead­ers still fall squarely into Fanon's think­ing that they are good at mimicry of the for­mer colonis­ers in their ac­tions in that they sought not to change the sys­tem but to re­place the colo­nial­ists. The African lead­ers have ac­cepted and rushed to adopt the neo-lib­eral eco­nomic so­lu­tions of the Bret­ton Woods In­sti­tu­tions (World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund). These so­lu­tions are in­vari­ably called struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grammes (SAPs) or staff-mon­i­tored pro­grammes (SMPs). These so­lu­tions are al­ways com­posed of three things — pri­vatis­ing State-owned en­ter­prises, cut­ting back on so­cial spend­ing and lib­er­al­is­ing the for­eign cur­rency ex­change mar­kets. The irony of the so­lu­tions is that Africa has a young pop­u­la­tion, a pop­u­la­tion that is in need of a de­cent ed­u­ca­tion and health for the pros­per­ity of the con­ti­nent. How does Africa de­velop when it has no ed­u­cated, trained or skilled youths? The con­ti­nent can­not de­velop with­out sig­nif­i­cant bud­get al­lo­ca­tions to­wards re­search and de­vel­op­ment, food suf­fi­ciency and in­tra-trans­port net­works. It also needs enough wa­ter and en­ergy sources to power in­dus­try. The COVID-19 pan­demic has taken the con­ti­nent back in terms of de­vel­op­ment. African lead­ers like their for­mer colo­nial masters have re­treated into their laagers. Coun­tries have re­sorted to their de­fault set­tings of uni­la­ter­ism in­stead of work­ing to­gether. In Sadc, we have no­ticed South Africa erect­ing a fence along the border to keep away Zim­bab­weans and other African im­mi­grants from the north from en­ter­ing its ter­ri­tory il­le­gally. Per­haps African sur­vival lies in hav­ing lead­ers in the mould of Cap­tain Thomas Sankara — a vi­sion­ary and prag­matic short-lived leader of Burk­ina Faso. Sankara un­der­stood what his coun­try needed to haul it­self out of poverty. In a short four-year reign be­fore his as­sas­si­na­tion, Sankara had brought food suf­fi­ciency, im­mu­nised over 60% of all chil­dren, in­creased lit­er­acy and es­tab­lished an able ad­min­is­tra­tion to de­liver the needs of Burk­ina Faso peo­ple. Look­ing back at pan-African lead­ers like Nkrumah and Muam­mar Gaddafi of Libya or Samora Machel of Mozam­bique among oth­ers is a sad re­minder of the dearth of lead­er­ship on the con­ti­nent. Africa can­not af­ford run­ning stand­still for an­other half-cen­tury nor should its lead­ers try to mimic the colo­nial­ists and im­ple­ment SAPs with­out con­text.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20141205,Ethiopia warns in­vestors of war and famine,"Ev­ery coun­try tap­ping the global sov­er­eign bond mar­ket de­tails the dan­gers in­vestors face in its prospec­tus, of­ten in a boil­er­plate sec­tion enu­mer­at­ing pos­si­ble prob­lems - such as fis­cal deficits or tax­a­tion is­sues - that is largely ig­nored. But the doc­u­ment sent by Ethiopia to in­ter­na­tional in­vestors ahead of its foray into the global sov­er­eign bond mar­ket is some­what dif­fer­ent. Far from a boil­er­plate, it in­cludes a list of un­fa­mil­iar haz­ards, such as famine, po­lit­i­cal ten­sion and war. The doc­u­ment, seen by the Fi­nan­cial Times, is a sober­ing re­minder of the risk of in­vest­ing in one of Africa’s less de­vel­oped na­tions. With gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per capita at less than $550 per year, Ethiopia is the poor­est coun­try yet to is­sue global bonds. In the prospec­tus, is­sued ahead of its ex­pected $1bn bond, Ethiopia tells in­vestors they need to con­sider the po­ten­tial re­sump­tion of the EritreaEthiopia war, which ended in 2000, although it “does not an­tic­i­pate fu­ture con­flict”. There is also the risk of famine, the “high level of poverty” and strained pub­lic fi­nances, as well as the pos­si­ble, if un­likely, block­ing of the coun­try’s only ac­cess to the sea through neigh­bour­ing Dji­bouti should re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries sour. Ad­dis Ababa, Ethiopia’s cap­i­tal, also warns that it is ranked close to the bot­tom of the UN Hu­man De­vel­op­ment In­dex - 173rd out of 187 na­tions - and cau­tions about the pos­si­bil­ity of po­lit­i­cal tur­moil. “The next gen­eral elec­tion is due to take place in May 2015 and while the gov­ern­ment ex­pects th­ese elec­tions to be peace­ful, there is a risk that po­lit­i­cal ten­sion and un­rest . . . may oc­cur.” But the long list of risks is not de­ter­ring in­vestors, as ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates in the US, the UK, Eu­ro­zone and Ja­pan push sov­er­eign wealth funds and pen­sion funds into riskier coun­tries in search of higher-yield­ing bonds. In­stead, some in­vestors are fo­cus­ing on the dan­ger of a cur­rency cri­sis. Ad­dis Ababa has de­val­ued its cur­rency, the birr, twice over the past five years - by 23.7 per cent in 2010 and 16.5 per cent in 2011 - in an ef­fort to win ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness. Since then, the Ethiopian cen­tral bank has man­aged to slow the cur­rency’s de­pre­ci­a­tion. Ad­dis Ababa has now told po­ten­tial in­vestors that “it may not be pos­si­ble for the Na­tional Bank of Ethiopia to man­age the ex­change rate as ef­fec­tively in the fu­ture as it has in the past” be­cause of re­duced hard cur­rency re­serves. The coun­try has re­serves to cover only 2.2 months’ worth of im­ports - almost half the 4.3 months it had in 2010-11. “Fail­ure to man­age a steadily de­pre­ci­at­ing ex­change rate may ad­versely af­fect Ethiopia’s econ­omy . . .

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170929,Govern­ment works to de­velop com­mu­nity tourism,"THE Min­istry of Tourism and Hospi­tal­ity In­dus­try is work­ing closely with sev­eral com­mu­ni­ties across the coun­try and as­sist­ing them to de­velop tourism projects within their re­spec­tive areas, an of­fi­cial said. The ini­tia­tive is part of the min­istry’s ef­forts to em­power both ur­ban and ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties to own and ben­e­fit from tourism re­sources through the Com­mu­nity Based Tourism En­ter­prises Pro­gramme. Speak­ing on be­half of the Tourism Min­is­ter Dr Wal­ter Mzembi, in Bulawayo on Wed­nes­day, per­ma­nent sec­re­tary, Dr Thokozile Chitepo said vi­brant com­mu­nity-based tourism projects were crit­i­cal in fos­ter­ing sus­tain­able devel­op­ment. “I’m de­lighted to note that the Min­istry of Tourism and Hospi­tal­ity In­dus­try is work­ing with var­i­ous com­mu­ni­ties through­out the coun­try both in ur­ban and ru­ral set-ups on com­mu­nity based tourism projects or en­ter­prises in or­der to achieve in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able so­cio-eco­nomic growth, em­ploy­ment cre­ation and poverty re­duc­tion,” she said. “Com­mu­nity based tourism en­ter­prises are owned and man­aged by com­mu­ni­ties and of­fer ser­vices to tourists while gen­er­at­ing wider com­mu­nity ben­e­fits.” Dr Chitepo said Bulawayo has ben­e­fited from such ini­tia­tives through the es­tab­lish­ment of a town­ship tourism project by the Bulawayo City Coun­cil (BCC) and Amakhosi Cul­tural Tours. She said that Zim­babwe must har­ness the power of tourism in or­der to meet the global 2030 agenda for sus­tain­able devel­op­ment. “Tourism in Zim­babwe has be­come a con­spic­u­ous pil­lar of our econ­omy, a pass­port to pros­per­ity, and a trans­for­ma­tive force for im­prov­ing mil­lions of lives.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191211,Zanu-PF mile­stones in lead-up to peo­ple’s ind­aba,"THE 18th Zanu-PF Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­fer­ence kicked off yes­ter­day in Goromonzi, Mashona­land East,with the party say­ing its ma­jor thrust is to ex­pe­dite the re­vival of the coun­try’s econ­omy. The an­nual pil­grim­age that brings to­gether the coun­try’s 10 prov­inces and for­eign del­e­gates, is ex­pected to be at­tended by 7000 del­e­gates who in­clude 2 000 for­eign del­e­gates. This is the second con­fer­ence since the in­cep­tion of the new dis­pen­sa­tion in Novem­ber 2017 which was fol­lowed by a spe­cial congress. The congress rat­i­fied the nom­i­na­tion of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa as leader of the rul­ing Zanu-PF where he out­lined his vi­sion for both party and coun­try es­pe­cially on the need to move away from pol­i­tics and chan­nel en­er­gies on the im­prove­ment of the coun­try’s econ­omy and re-en­gag­ing to re­po­si­tion Zim­babwe glob­ally. The fol­low­ing year, the party held its con­fer­ence in Esigo­dini, Mata­bele­land South, which saw the con­tin­u­a­tion of the eco­nomic thrust dom­i­nat­ing the meet­ing’s agenda. Crit­i­cally, the two con­fer­ences were held at a time when the party had moved away from the days of toxic fac­tional fights that char­ac­terised the pre­vi­ous dis­pen­sa­tion es­pe­cially to­wards con­fer­ences. Zanu-PF Sec­re­tary for In­for­ma­tion and Pub­lic­ity Cde Si­mon Khaya Moyo re­it­er­ated on Mon­day that this year’s con­fer­ence will fo­cus on the econ­omy. “I must em­pha­sise that the con­fer­ence’s fo­cus is on the econ­omy. Here of course we are look­ing at food se­cu­rity, so­cial ser­vices and poverty erad­i­ca­tion, macro and eco­nomic sta­bil­ity, re-en­gage­ment, in­clu­sive growth, in­fras­truc­ture de­vel­op­ment, value edi­tion and this will be dis­cussed in de­tail in the­matic com­mit­tees. “It is ex­pected the Min­is­ter of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube will give an over­view of the state of the econ­omy,” he said adding that other Cabi­net Min­is­ters will also make pre­sen­ta­tions. A lot of de­vel­op­ments have hap­pened be­tween the two con­fer­ences. Chief among them was the re-in­tro­duc­tion of the Zim­bab­wean dol­lar giv­ing the coun­try con­trol of its fis­cal and mon­e­tary pol­icy. The Govern­ment made strides in fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion that in­volved trim­ming of pub­lic ex­pen­di­ture, ramp­ing up rev­enue mo­bil­i­sa­tion and sig­nif­i­cantly re­duc­ing the fis­cal deficit. Through the two per­cent tax, the Govern­ment has also bankrolled key lo­cal in­fras­truc­tural projects such as the du­al­i­sa­tion of the Beit­bridge-Harare high­way and the stretch from the cap­i­tal along the Harare-Bu­l­awayo Road. The Govern­ment has also dis­bursed more than $300 mil­lion un­der the de­vo­lu­tion drive to cater for vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties. Last month, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, speak­ing in Bu­l­awayo, said the Govern­ment was go­ing to in­crease de­vo­lu­tion al­lo­ca­tion from the $703 mil­lion al­lo­cated this year. The pro­vi­sion of af­ford­able trans­port through the re­vival of Zupco saw com­muters pay­ing be­tween $1 and $2 per trip for most ur­ban routes com­pared to $5 be­ing charged by pri­vate kom­bis.The re­forms in the in­vest­ment sec­tor saw Zim­babwe mov­ing 15 steps up the global ease of do­ing busi­ness sur­vey by the World Bank from 155 to 140 with the Govern­ment say­ing more needs to be done to move up the list. In­ter­na­tional re-en­gage­ment with an eco­nomic bias saw Zim­babwe strength­en­ing ties with a num­ber of coun­tries and blocs, among them the Euro­pean Union, United Arab Emi­rates, Rus­sia, Bri­tain, China, Rus­sia, Ja­pan, Is­rael and oth­ers. The coun­try also scored a diplo­matic coup af­ter Sadc re­solved to set a side Oc­to­ber 25 as the sol­i­dar­ity day against il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe and re­solved to con­duct var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties in their re­spec­tive coun­tries on the day to call for the im­me­di­ate re­moval of the eco­nomic em­bargo. The re­gional cam­paign widened be­yond the re­gional bloc to the en­tire con­ti­nent when the African Union (AU) voiced its ob­jec­tions to the sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe calling for their im­me­di­ate re­moval. In­ter­na­tion­ally, China, Cuba and the NonAligned Move­ment made strong calls for the re­moval of the sanc­tions. The anti-cor­rup­tion drive by Govern­ment recorded a num­ber of ar­rests in­clud­ing se­nior of­fi­cials most prom­i­nent be­ing for­mer Tourism Min­is­ter Priscah Mup­fu­mira and Dr Jo­ram Gumbo.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20171022,En­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion: Is in­ter­na­tional trade to blame?,"GLOB­AL­I­SA­TION has re­sulted in the con­trac­tion of space and time, a devel­op­ment that has seen a rapid ex­pan­sion of in­ter­na­tional and global eco­nomic growth. It has also co­in­cided with a dra­matic rise in global en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion, in the form of in­creased air and marine pol­lu­tion, de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion and de­for­esta­tion, loss of bi­o­log­i­cal di­ver­sity and cli­mate change. This un­wanted devel­op­ment has raised im­por­tant ques­tions such as whether in­ter­na­tional trade is re­ally to blame for en­vi­ron­ment degra­da­tion. Ja­son Bord­off, a trade ex­pert, said, in­ter­na­tional trade has seen multi­na­tional com­pa­nies wreak havoc on the global en­vi­ron­ment by mov­ing op­er­a­tions to coun­tries where en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions are weak or non-ex­is­tent. Eco­nomic growth re­quires the use of in­creased quan­ti­ties of en­ergy and nat­u­ral re­sources. An­other trade guru who goes by the name Svein Bra­then states that this in­crease in re­source use and pro­duc­tion of­ten re­sults in ad­verse en­vi­ron­men­tal con­se­quences. This is be­cause less de­vel­oped economies gen­er­ally have lim­ited reg­u­la­tions con­cern­ing the pro­tec­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment while de­vel­oped economies have im­posed rel­a­tively strin­gent en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion laws. A World Bank study of 2015 shows that clear­ing forests to grow crops ac­counted for about 20 per­cent of global car­bon emis­sions. But there is lit­tle ev­i­dence that com­pa­nies choose to in­vest in such coun­tries to shirk pol­lu­tion-abate­ment costs in rich coun­tries. In­stead, the most im­por­tant fac­tor in de­ter­min­ing the amount of in­vest­ment is the size of the lo­cal mar­ket. It has also been found that within a given in­dus­try, for­eign-op­er­ated plants tended to pol­lute less than lo­cal peers. How­ever, many en­vi­ron­men­tal groups ar­gue that un­re­stricted com­pe­ti­tion across coun­tries re­sults in pro­duc­tion be­ing shifted to those coun­tries with the least re­stric­tive en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions since th­ese coun­tries ex­pe­ri­ence lower pro­duc­tion costs. They sug­gest that the re­moval of trade bar­ri­ers makes it more dif­fi­cult for coun­tries to en­act en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion laws that will re­duce their abil­ity to com­pete in in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. “De­vel­op­ing coun­tries are caught be­tween a rock and a hard place, if they don’t re­move trade bar­ri­ers their economies suf­fer and when they re­move their en­vi­ron­ment suf­fers,” said Dr Cor­nelius Ncube, the chair­per­son of the Depart­ment of Devel­op­ment Stud­ies at Lu­pane State Univer­sity. The ad­verse ef­fects of in­ter­na­tional trade are felt ev­ery­where, it is ac­cel­er­at­ing the use of nat­u­ral re­sources such as wa­ter, forests, fish­eries, and min­er­als, much faster than they can be re­gen­er­ated. In­ter­na­tional trade has also re­sulted in an in­crease in car­bon-emit­ting eco­nomic growth and de­for­esta­tion re­sult­ing in cli­mate change which has in­creased the rate of nat­u­ral dis­as­ters that have wreaked havoc on the en­vi­ron­ment. Floods have de­stroyed veg­e­ta­tion and an­i­mals as well as sweep­ing away the top soil. Sea lev­els are ris­ing and oceans are be­com­ing warmer. Longer and more in­tense droughts are de­stroy­ing crops, wildlife and fresh­wa­ter sup­plies. “The con­nec­tion be­tween car­bone­mit­ting eco­nomic growth and in­creas­ing trade and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion brought by glob­al­i­sa­tion is un­mis­tak­able,” Weiner An­tweiler, Brian Copeland and Scott Tay­lor wrote a pa­per ti­tled Is Trade Good For The En­vi­ron­ment for the Na­tional Bureau of Eco­nom­ics. In­deed, as world trade grows and mil­lions of fac­to­ries join the global sup­ply chain, as mines are ex­ploited and tim­ber is felled to meet ris­ing con­sumer de­mands, en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion and in­creased pol­lu­tion is of­ten the price. Pol­lu­tion hits the orig­i­nat­ing coun­try first, con­tam­i­nat­ing its soil and wa­ter, but soon is ab­sorbed in the at­mos­phere, where it be­comes a global prob­lem — poi­son­ing the air and bring­ing acid rain to other parts of the world. The emer­gence of China’s blaz­ing eco­nomic growth, sup­ply­ing cheap prod­ucts to the world, has high costs to the en­vi­ron­ment. Ac­cel­er­ated burn­ing of coal and use of chem­i­cals to fuel the ex­port ma­chine pol­lutes not only China’s air and wa­ter, but the world’s en­vi­ron­ment as well. A 2004 study found that the jet stream dis­persed chem­i­cals like mer­cury, spewed by fac­to­ries in China, to lo­ca­tions thou­sands of miles away. A re­searcher traced a plume of dirty air from Asia to New Eng­land, where anal­y­sis of col­lected sam­ples re­vealed the chem­i­cals had orig­i­nated in China, re­ported the Wall Street Jour­nal in 2004. The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) and by ex­ten­sion in­ter­na­tional trade, also stands ac­cused of de­stroy­ing the global en­vi­ron­ment. Ex­pand­ing trade driven by glob­al­i­sa­tion has brought about in­creased fish­ing, de­struc­tion of forest­land, and the spread of pol­lut­ing in­dus­tries to the de­vel­op­ing world. In a 2005 re­port, the UN Food and Agri­cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion re­ported that each year about 18 mil­lion acres of the world’s forests — an area the size of Panama or Sierra Leone — are lost due to de­for­esta­tion. Se­ri­ous crit­ics of in­ter­na­tional trade such as Rus­sell Ber­man re­luc­tantly ac­knowl­edge that de­for­esta­tion can­not be laid at the door of in­ter­na­tional trade alone. But they rightly point out that in­ter­na­tional trade does serve as both a con­duit and an ac­cel­er­a­tor for many of the forces that cause the loss of for­est cover world­wide. Ad­vo­cates of in­ter­na­tional trade, how­ever, note that the de­mand for en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion rises as coun­tries develop. In­di­vid­u­als who are in poverty tend to ex­ploit the en­vi­ron­ment in an un­sus­tain­able man­ner that leads to the de­struc­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment. Since free in­ter­na­tional trade is ex­pected to en­cour­age eco­nomic devel­op­ment, it is ar­gued that in­ter­na­tional trade en­cour­ages in­creased en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. Those who sup­port in­ter­na­tional trade also ob­serve that in­creased trade is of­ten ac­com­pa­nied by in­creased for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. Since for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment gen­er­ally in­volves a tech­nol­ogy trans­fer from de­vel­oped to less de­vel­oped economies, de­vel­op­ing economies usu­ally adopt the rel­a­tively “cleaner” pro­duc­tion meth­ods in use in de­vel­oped economies. This ar­gu­ment sug­gests that free trade en­cour­ages the adop­tion of more en­vi­ron­men­tally sound pro­duc­tion pro­cesses in de­vel­op­ing economies. Dr Ncube said: “With devel­op­ment comes en­vi­ron­ment pro­tec­tion and con­ser­va­tion. For ex­am­ple the poor who used to ex­ploit the land for fire­wood turn to stoves and other meth­ods of en­ergy that spare the en­vi­ron­ment. But as long as the ma­jor­ity are in poverty, pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment is not a pri­or­ity, the stom­ach is.” One rea­son why en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion is lag­ging in many coun­tries is low in­comes. Coun­tries that live on the mar­gin may sim­ply not be able to af­ford to set aside re­sources for pol­lu­tion abate­ment, nor may they think that they should sac­ri­fice their growth prospects to help solve global pol­lu­tion prob­lems that in large part have been caused by the con­sum­ing life style of richer coun­tries. If poverty is at the core of the prob­lem, eco­nomic growth will be part of the so­lu­tion, to the ex­tent that it al­lows coun­tries to shift gear from more im­me­di­ate con­cerns to long run sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues. In­deed, at least some em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence sug­gests that pol­lu­tion in­creases at the early stages of devel­op­ment but de­creases af­ter a cer­tain in­come level has been reached. “Trade is one cylin­der that pro­pels the en­gine of growth,” WTO tends to ar­gue. In ad­di­tion, in­ter­na­tional trade can pro­mote greater ef­fi­ciency in pro­duc­tion and the dif­fu­sion of en­vi­ron­men­tal tech­nolo­gies and stan­dards through­out the world. For ex­am­ple, more glob­ally ori­ented com­pa­nies in the chem­i­cal and steel in­dus­tries tend to adopt and pro­mote higher en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards than na­tional com­pa­nies. Sur­pris­ingly, de­spite the avail­abil­ity of en­ergy-ef­fi­cient tech­nolo­gies and knowhow, lit­tle use is made of them. The world seems paral­ysed about how to face the threat of global warm­ing. The world’s top emit­ter of green­house gases, the United States, has re­fused to sign the Ky­oto Pro­to­col, and the na­tions that have signed it have been in­con­sis­tent with its im­ple­men­ta­tion, mak­ing only per­func­tory at­tempts to grap­ple with the chal­lenge of global warm­ing which ad­versely af­fects the en­vi­ron­ment. The Montreal Pro­to­col is a 1987 in­ter­na­tional treaty de­signed to pro­tect the ozone layer by phas­ing out the pro­duc­tion of nu­mer­ous sub­stances that are re­spon­si­ble for ozone de­ple­tion. Yet there is ev­i­dence that with the com­mit­ment of na­tions and ef­fec­tive global gover­nance, it is pos­si­ble to avert dan­ger­ous trends. “Thanks to con­certed ac­tion taken in com­bat­ing ozone de­ple­tion through the Montreal Pro­to­col, the ozone hole has shrunk. There are even signs that as a re­sult of eco­nomic growth, ur­ban­i­sa­tion and enlightened pub­lic poli­cies born of global aware­ness, more na­tions are re­vers­ing the long-stand­ing trend to­ward de­struc­tion of their forests,” Nayan Chanda, the founder and editor-in-chief of YaleGlobal On­line, an on­line mag­a­zine that pub­lishes ar­ti­cles about glob­al­i­sa­tion, wrote in his book Bound To­gether: How Traders, Preach­ers, Ad­ven­tur­ers and War­riors Shaped Glob­al­i­sa­tion. In a nut­shell, the trade–en­vi­ron­ment nexus re­mains a controversial and chal­leng­ing is­sue on the in­ter­na­tional trade agenda. While it is true that in­ter­na­tional trade de­grades the en­vi­ron­ment it is also true that in­ter­na­tional trade at times pro­tects the en­vi­ron­ment in the long run, thanks to ad­vances in tech­nol­ogy.",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160606,Equal­ity as a stim­u­lus for growth,"More than 50 years af­ter the in­cep­tion of the African Union (for­merly Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity), France claims the right to ex­ploit any nat­u­ral re­source dis­cov­ered in for­mer colonies and forces African coun­tries to give its com­pa­nies pref­er­ences in pub­lic pro­cure­ment. Book: Why Na­tions Fail Au­thors: Daron Ace­moglu &amp; James A. Robin­son Pub­lisher: Pro­file Books (2012) ISBN: 978 1 84668 430 2 THE ex­panse be­tween rich and poor na­tions is vast and sus­tained. Ex­plain­ing the gap has long been the site of con­tro­versy. The per­sis­tence of poverty sparks off clichés of ev­ery mood and rests bit­terly in the con­scious­ness of the de­prived. But not there is no con­sen­sus as to why qual­ity of life and other devel­op­ment in­dices are con­stantly wind­ing down in some coun­tries and shoring up in oth­ers. Diverg­ing choices and fates coun­tries reach in re­li­gion, cul­ture, ge­og­ra­phy or knowl­edge have been in­voked to ex­plain the gap be­tween the haves and the have-nots . How­ever, ac­cord­ing to Daron Ace­moglu and James A. Robin­son’s 2012 book, “Why Na­tions Fail,” these ex­pla­na­tions can­not an­swer why off­shoots of the same civil­i­sa­tion, such as North and South Korea, have as­sumed starkly con­trast­ing for­tunes. “Why Na­tions Fail: The Ori­gins of Power, Pros­per­ity and Poverty” builds on long-run his­tor­i­cal de­vel­op­ments to pro­pose an al­ter­na­tive the­ory of wealth and poverty. The au­thors ar­gue that in­clu­sive eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tions, an­chored on democ­racy, equal­ity and mer­i­toc­racy, pro­vide the in­cen­tive for in­no­va­tion and in­vest­ment, hence sus­tained growth. On the other hand, ex­trac­tive in­sti­tu­tions, whereby the rul­ing elites are bent to ex­tract the eco­nomic out­put of the rest, fa­cil­i­tate stag­na­tion and un­der­de­vel­op­ment since there is no in­cen­tive for in­no­va­tion and in­vest­ment. Be­cause ex­trac­tive in­sti­tu­tions are in­her­ently re­pres­sive as a req­ui­site for pro­tect­ing il­le­git­i­mate priv­i­leges, they tend to sti­fle the dis­rup­tive cre­ativ­ity and new tal­ent needed for sus­tain­able growth. Ac­cord­ing to the the­ory, am­bi­tion re­sponds to in­cen­tive so coun­tries with in­clu­sive in­sti­tu­tions and out­grow those im­peded by po­lit­i­cal bar­ri­ers. “In­clu­sive eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tions that en­force prop­erty rights, cre­ate a level play­ing field, and en­cour­age in­vest­ments in new tech­nolo­gies and skills are more con­ducive to eco­nomic growth than ex­trac­tive eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tions that are struc­tured to ex­tract re­sources from the many by the few and that fail to pro­tect prop­erty rights or pro­vide in­cen­tives for eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity,” the duo ar­gues. Ace­moglu and Robin­son ar­gue that in­sti­tu­tional drift, a sit­u­a­tion whereby both in­clu­sive and ex­trac­tive economies tend to­wards res­o­lute paths, is bound to widen the gap be­tween poor and rich na­tions, bar crit­i­cal junc­ture of his­tory. The duo’s case for egal­i­tar­ian in­stitu- tions is force­fully ar­gued and ur­gently felt, but there are glar­ing ironies in the way the au­thors si­t­u­ate their the­ory in the world to­day. The ar­gu­ment is per­sua­sive as a ba­sis for and un­der­stand­ing in­equal­ity and fa­cil­i­tat­ing in­clu­sive devel­op­ment but it slanted to priv­i­lege the West. Ace­moglu and Robin­son ac­knowl­edge that slav­ery and colo­nial­ism cre­ated a vi­cious cir­cle of un­der­de­vel­op­ment in Africa, but go on give an over­whelm­ing im­pres­sion that much of Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa is poor be­cause of its ex­trac­tive ten­den­cies, while West­ern Europe and North Amer­ica’s wealth and power is at­trib­ut­able to their es­pousal of demo­cratic val­ues. Such an in­ter­pre­ta­tion er­ro­neously iso­lates in­di­vid­ual na­tions from the big- ger pic­ture, the re­la­tion­ship of ex­ploita­tion which cur­rently priv­i­leges the global north and stunts the global south. The par­tic­u­lar eu­lo­gi­sa­tion of Bri­tain, France and the US as na­tions whose pros­per­ity are an­chored on demo­cratic val­ues, not­with­stand­ing their con­cur­rent ex­ploita­tion of Africa plays down the uni­ver­sal essence of democ­racy. Neo-colo­nial­ism has been of­ten swept aside as an in­con­se­quen­tial ab­stract or ex­cuse for de­flect­ing at­ten­tion away from do­mes­tic dys­func­tion, it is one em­pir­i­cally ob­serv­able ex­pla­na­tion of un­der­de­vel­op­ment in Africa. France’s ex­trac­tive op­er­a­tions in its for­mer colonies is a case in point. Ac­cord­ing to a 2015 is­sue of Pam­bazuka News, 14 African coun­tries are still pay­ing a debt for be­ing de­vel­oped by France dur­ing the colo­nial pe­riod and France can au­to­mat­i­cally con­fis­cate a for­mer colony’s na­tional re­serve. More than 50 years af­ter the in­cep­tion of the African Union (for­merly Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity), France claims the right to ex­ploit any nat­u­ral re­source dis­cov­ered in for­mer colonies and forces African coun­tries to give its com­pa­nies pref­er­ences in pub­lic pro­cure­ment. It claims the right to de­ploy troops and in­ter­vene in the African coun­try to de­fend France’s in­ter­ests and forces for­mer colonies to use the colo­nial cur­rency, among other colo­nial priv­i­leges. These colo­nial ad­van­tages, and the fact that African coun­tries get less than 10 per­cent the value of their re­sources, seems to me a cred­i­ble ex­pla­na­tion of why na­tions fail. As long as democ­racy is held to be uni­ver­sally ap­pli­ca­ble, what­ever credit can be ex­tended to the im­pe­ri­al­ists for in­clu­siv­ity in their ap­por­tion­ment of the spoils of plun­der seems to con­spir­acy than democ­racy. All the same, the es­sen­tial the­ory of the book holds and must be ex­tended to ev­ery layer of in­equal­ity. In­ter­nal dys­func­tion must not be used to de­flect scru­tiny of cap­i­tal­ist and im­pe­ri­al­ist ex­trac­tion, and the re­serve equally holds. Ace­moglu and Robin­son’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion of Zim­babwe’s land re­form pro­gramme as vi­o­la­tion of prop­erty rights is also slanted and not en­tirely his­tor­i­cal. The land re­form pro­gramme is, in fact, closer to the duo’s in­sti­tu­tional re­form than they re­alise as it is ef­fec­tively the dis­man­tling of the ex­trac­tive priv­i­leges of a mi­nor­ity and a sig­nif­i­cant step to­wards in­clu­sive devel­op­ment in an agro-based econ­omy. The au­thors bring up cre­ative de­struc­tion as a con­stant for eco­nomic growth and ob­serve that ex­trac­tive po­lit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions are op­posed to the phe­nom­e­non as it threat­ens their rel­e­vance. Whereas the ex­am­ples cited, in­clud­ing re­sis­tance to the ini­tial print­ing and tex­tile tech­nol­ogy by the Ot­toman em­pire and the Tu­dor monar­chy re­spec­tively, sup­port this idea, it is not only the ex­trac­tive au­thor­i­tar­i­ans and lud­dites whose turf is threat­ened by cre­ative de­struc­tion. Con­trary to Ace­moglu and Robin­son’s ar­gu­ment, in­clu­sive in­sti­tu­tions have an obli­ga­tion to sub­ject cre­ative de­struc­tion to demo­cratic scru­tiny and to pre­vent a course of devel­op­ment which pri­ori­tises profit over peo­ple. Robert McCh­es­ney and John Ni­chols’s 2016 book, “Peo­ple Get Ready: The Fight against a Job­less Econ­omy and Ci­ti­zen­less Democ­racy” de­nies a clean bill of health to an emerg­ing wave of cre­ative de­struc­tion whereby ro­bots and automation are set to throw mil­lions out of jobs while con­cen­trate prof­its for com­pa­nies by dras­ti­cally cut­ting the wage bill. Ace­moglu and Robin­son rule out aid as a means out of poverty, par­tic­u­larly be­cause so lit­tle is di­rected to the eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture. The fail­ure of the United Na­tions’ Afghan mis­sion is a case in point. “Bil­lions of dol­lars were now com­ing to Afghanistan. But lit­tle of it was used for build­ing in­fra­struc­ture, schools, or other pub­lic ser­vices es­sen­tial for the devel­op­ment of in­clu­sive in­sti­tu­tions or even for restor­ing law and or­der. “While much of the in­fra­struc­ture re­mained in tat­ters, the first tranche of the money was used to com­mis­sion an air­line to shut­tle around UN and other in­ter­na­tional of­fi­cials. “The next thing they needed were driv­ers and in­ter­preters. So they hired the few English-speak­ing bu­reau­crats and the re­main­ing teach­ers in Afghan schools to chauf­feur and chap­er­one them around, pay­ing them mul­ti­ples of cur­rent Afghan salaries,” the duo ob­serves. China, which has been char­ac­terised as an al­ter­na­tive devel­op­ment model to the Washington Con­sen­sus, seems to be a stum­bling block to the duo’s the­o­ri­sa­tion of democ­racy and lib­er­al­i­sa­tion as con­di­tions for growth. The duo ar­gues that China’s growth is still con­sis­tent with their the­ory as it con­curred with a shift from ex­trac­tive in­sti­tu­tions to in­clu­sive ones over the past three decades, be­gin­ning with the re­forms of Deng Xiaop­ing.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191220,Global ac­tion needed to fight fall army­worm,"DEAL­ING with trans­bound­ary pests is tricky at the best of times. Stan­dards, prac­tices, ca­pac­ity lev­els and en­gage­ment vary across coun­tries and re­gions, and re­sponses are of­ten ad hoc and in­ef­fec­tive. How­ever, mat­ters be­come even more com­plex when the pest in ques­tion flies over bor­ders, threat­ens the food se­cu­rity and liveli­hoods of mil­lions, and causes se­vere en­vi­ron­men­tal and eco­nomic dam­age along the way. Fall army­worm is such a pest. As a step for­ward, the Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion of the United Na­tions (FAO) with the “Global Ac­tion for Fall Army­worm Con­trol”, a pi­o­neer­ing ini­tia­tive, aims to mo­bilise US$500 mil­lion over 2020-22 to take rad­i­cal, di­rect and co­or­di­nated mea­sures to fight fall army­worm at a global level. A brief in­tro­duc­tion Fall army­worm is an in­va­sive moth orig­i­nat­ing in the Amer­i­cas. It prefers to eat maize, but also feeds on 80 or more other crops, in­clud­ing rice, sorghum, mil­let, sug­ar­cane, veg­etable crops and cot­ton. Once es­tab­lished in an area, fall army­worm is al­most im­pos­si­ble to erad­i­cate and very dif­fi­cult to stop spread­ing. A sprightly adult can fly up to sev­eral hun­dred kilo­me­tres! In­deed, since its ar­rival in West Africa nearly four years ago, fall army­worm has al­ready spread across the African con­ti­nent; and be­yond Africa, to more than a dozen Asian coun­tries, in­clud­ing China and In­dia. Europe could be next. It’s hard to cal­cu­late the global ex­tent of fall army­worm dam­age, but based on 2018 es­ti­mates from 12 coun­tries, maize yield losses in Africa could be as high as 17,7 mil­lion tonnes an­nu­ally. This equates to 40 per­cent of Africa’s an­nual maize yield or US$4,6 bil­lion. The most di­rect im­pact is on the con­ti­nent’s small­holder maize farm­ers, most of whom rely on the crop to stave off hunger and poverty. What is the Global Ac­tion? FAO’s new Global Ac­tion for fall army­worm con­trol will mas­sively scale up FAO projects and ac­tiv­i­ties to reach out to hun­dreds of mil­lions of af­fected farm­ers. The Global Ac­tion has three key ob­jec­tives: (i) es­tab­lish global co­or­di­na­tion and re­gional col­lab­o­ra­tion on mon­i­tor­ing, early warn­ing and In­te­grated Pest Man­age­ment of Fall Army­worm, (ii) re­duce as­so­ci­ated crop losses and (iii) lower the risk of fur­ther spread. The Global Ac­tion will tar­get the three re­gions that have ex­pe­ri­enced a fall army­worm in­va­sion in re­cent years — Africa, the Near East and Asia — and align with FAO’s new data-driven Hand-in-Hand Ini­tia­tive, which aims to sup­port achieve­ment of the UN Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals by pair­ing the most de­vel­oped coun­tries with those with the high­est poverty and hunger rates. Knowl­edge shar­ing, in­no­va­tion Para­mount in the Global Ac­tion will be co­or­di­nated ef­forts to spread knowl­edge and in­for­ma­tion to small­hold­ers af­fected by fall army­worm, es­pe­cially through the es­tab­lish­ment or scal­ing up of ded­i­cated na­tional task forces. These task forces will both bol­ster and go be­yond cur­rent FAO ini­tia­tives, such as the Farmer Field School pro­gramme, reach­ing into the most iso­lated com­mu­ni­ties. The Global Ac­tion will also pro­mote bi­o­log­i­cal pest con­trol and other in­no­va­tive field prac­tices, as well as tech­nolo­gies such as the open source Fall Army­worm Mon­i­tor­ing and Early Warn­ing Sys­tem (FAMEWS) tool, which uses ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to help farm­ers with smart­phones to de­tect fall army­worm dam­age and choose ap­pro­pri­ate re­sponse ac­tions. As a near real-time data cen­tre, FAMEWS al­lows for bet­ter es­ti­mates on pest spread and crop dam­age, which helps in tar­get­ing in­ter­ven­tions. There is no one-size-fits-all rem­edy. Com­bat­ing fall army­worm will re­quire be­spoke, sci­ence-based solutions that take ac­count of the spe­cific con­text of each in­fested area. How­ever, know­ing what works best, and where, will re­quire fur­ther re­search. Lo­cal knowl­edge and the decades’ worth of ex­pe­ri­ence of deal­ing with fall army­worm in the Amer­i­cas will also be im­por­tant guides. An aus­pi­cious be­gin­ning It is fit­ting that De­cem­ber’s launch of the Global Ac­tion came just two days af­ter the of­fi­cial open­ing of the FAO-led United Na­tions In­ter­na­tional Year of Plant Health 2020 (IYPH). The IYPH un­der­lines the im­por­tance of plant health to both plan­e­tary and hu­man health, and urges ac­tion against the fur­ther spread of pests and dis­eases, par­tic­u­larly due to cli­mate change, trade and other fac­tors. Ul­ti­mately, the suc­cess of the Global Ac­tion, IYPH 2020 and other plant health ini­tia­tives will be de­ter­mined by the abil­ity of a broad range of stake­hold­ers to work to­gether for a com­mon goal. FAO will play a lead role in driv­ing this part­ner­ship model and, in the words of FAO Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral, Qu Dongyu, com­mit “to putting the knowl­edge, ex­pe­ri­ence and lessons learned from stake­hold­ers and part­ners at the ser­vice of farm­ers through­out the world to stem the global threat of this pest”. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210107,Can Zim take ad­van­tage of Africa’s new free trade zone?,"MANY African coun­tries — in­clud­ing Zim­babwe — have pinned their hopes for eco­nomic re­newal on the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agree­ment that came into force on Jan­u­ary 1, 2021. The AfCFTA — ini­tially set to com­mence on July 1 2020 but de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus — seeks to boost in­tra-Africa trade. As of De­cem­ber 2020, 54 coun­tries had signed the agree­ment, while 34 coun­tries have de­posited their in­stru­ments of rat­i­fi­ca­tion, ac­cord­ing to Wamkele Mene, the AfCFTA sec­re­tary-gen­eral. If im­ple­mented fully, the trade pact could boost re­gional in­come by 7% or US$450 bil­lion, speed up wage growth for women, and lift 30 mil­lion peo­ple out of ex­treme poverty by 2035, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank. A re­port from the World Bank shows that Zim­babwe and Côte d’Ivoire — where trade costs are among the con­ti­nent’s high­est — would see the big­gest gains of the AfCFTA, with each in­creas­ing in­come by 14%. But econ­o­mists ar­gue Zim­babwe needs to put its house in or­der first for it to Zim­babwe used to have a ro­bust man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which would have put it first in the queue of coun­tries that could ben­e­fit from the AfCFTA. Decades of mis­man­age­ment, how­ever, have cre­ated an econ­omy of im­porters rather than pro­duc­ers. The South­ern African coun­try re­lies on im­ports of nearly ev­ery­thing from fur­ni­ture, chem­i­cals, cloth­ing to even tooth­picks from its neigh­bour­ing coun­try South Africa and its “all­weather friend”, China. Pros­per Chi­ta­m­bara, an economist in Harare, tells The Africa Re­port that Zim­babwe will not im­me­di­ately ben­e­fit from the trade pact. “We have low ca­pac­ity in all key sec­tors of the econ­omy and in par­tic­u­lar the agri­cul­tural and the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors. [Our] com­pet­i­tive­ness and pro­duc­tiv­ity gap is huge and this ren­ders us in­ca­pable of com­pet­ing with the rest of the African na­tions,” he says. He adds that the coun­try needs to strengthen the in­dus­trial sec­tor and ad­dress chal­lenges in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor. “We need to in­crease in­vest­ment in crit­i­cal pro­duc­tiv­ity en­hance­ment sec­tors like in in­fra­struc­ture and in par­tic­u­lar ir­ri­ga­tion, as well as trans­port and en­ergy in­fra­struc­ture. These are the key en­ablers to un­lock value within agri­cul­ture, in­dus­try and the rest of the econ­omy,” Chi­ta­m­bara ex­plains. The South­ern African coun­try, which was once the bread­bas­ket of Africa, will im­port an es­ti­mated 1,1 mil­lion tonnes of grain in the 2020/2021 mar­ket­ing year, ac­cord­ing to the UN Food and Agri­cul­ture Or­gan­i­sa­tion. Nearly eight mil­lion peo­ple, about half of Zim­babwe’s pop­u­la­tion, are food in­se­cure, ac­cord­ing to the UN’s World Food Pro­gramme. Economist Vic­tor Bhoroma ( pic­tured) says Zim­babwe’s ex­ports are mostly raw ma­te­ri­als and that lo­cal in­dus­tries are not com­pet­i­tive re­gion­ally. “Zim­babwe’s low man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion means that lo­cal in­dus­tries can­not com­pete with re­gional peers such as those from Zam­bia, South Africa, An­gola and Namibia that have en­joyed longer pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic and cur­rency sta­bil­ity, and pol­icy con­sis­tency,” he ex­plains. Bhoroma says the ma­jor set­backs for Zim­babwe to ben­e­fit from the trade pact in­clude low in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion, high cost of do­ing busi­ness and com­plex tax­a­tion pro­ce­dures, pol­icy in­con­sis­tency — es­pe­cially on mone­tary re­forms — in­ef­fi­cient for­eign ex­change poli­cies and por­ous bor­ders that make it hard to pre­vent smug­gling. “[There is need to] im­ple­ment a mar­ket de­ter­mined man­aged float ex­change rate to re­move ar­bi­trage op­por­tu­ni­ties that threaten pri­mary pro­duc­tion lo­cally in favour of im­port­ing fin­ished prod­ucts,” he says. “Mone­tary pol­icy con­sis­tency is key to sta­ble pro­duc­tion and ex­port ca­pac­ity.” Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ZNCC) pres­i­dent Ti­nashe Manzungu says for lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of trade to bear fruit, African states must over­come the trade con­straints. “These sup­ply con­straints in­clude weak in­fra­struc­ture [and] time con­sumed pro­ce­dures at cus­toms bor­ders,” The AfCFTA of­fers Zim­babwe an op­por­tu­nity to re­cover from the eco­nomic tur­moil caused by the coro­n­avirus. Zim­babwe’s econ­omy shrank by more than 6% in 2019. In 2020, there was likely go­ing to be a fur­ther con­trac­tion of 5-10%, ac­cord­ing to the World Bank. ZNCC pres­i­dent Manzungu says that while the global econ­omy is in tur­moil due to the COVID-19, the cre­ation of a vast re­gional mar­ket will help Zim­babwe di­ver­sify its ex­ports, ac­cel­er­ate growth and at­tract for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe In­dus­tries pres­i­dent Henry Ruzvidzo says the AfCFTA will en­cour­age in­ter-Africa trade, which is low at the mo­ment. “We have the op­por­tu­nity to lever­age on our lo­ca­tion, re­source en­dow­ments and con­sid­er­able man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and know-how to get a head start in the race,” he says. Con­stance Chemwayi, a min­istry of for­eign af­fairs and in­ter­na­tional trade spokesper­son, tells The Africa Re­port that Zim­babwe is pre­par­ing tar­iff of­fers to sub­mit to the AfCFTA sec­re­tar­iat in or­der to op­er­a­tionalise the trade pact. She said these will show the pref­er­en­tial tar­iffs to be ap­plied on im­ports com­ing from the con­ti­nent, with the aim of even­tu­ally elim­i­nat­ing the tar­iffs. Chemwayi says that once Zim­babwe sub­mits the tar­iff of­fers and they are sub­se­quently gazetted, the po­ten­tial ben­e­fits in­clude ac­cess to ex­port and im­port mar­kets at re­duced pref­er­en­tial cus­toms du­ties for prod­ucts with agreed rules of ori­gin from the con­ti­nent. “The pref­er­en­tial du­ties will be favourable as com­pared to the most-favoured­na­tion du­ties, which are payable by coun­tries not party to the AfCFTA,” she adds. “While there is a need to boost lo­cal in­dus­tries so that we can fully ben­e­fit from the agree­ment, the gov­ern­ment is work­ing to cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for busi­ness to take ad­van­tage of the AfCFTA.”",津巴布韦

He even­tu­ally bought his free­dom. The earth be­came one globe, and peo­ple and na­tions could see that they formed one hu­man­ity. Trag­i­cally, they did not act on this aware­ness. Euro­peans and other con­quer­ing na­tions got to know th­ese “new worlds”, only to sub­ject them to their rule, and plun­der their wealth in hu­mans (slave trade), min­er­als (gold, sil­ver, cop­per, coal, etc), land (farms), wa­ter (fish), forests (tim­ber). It was in­deed tragic that the first en­coun­ters be­tween dif­fer­ent na­tions on this earth were of­ten vi­o­lent for the sake of gain, ex­ploita­tion and power. The cli­max of this most un­for­tu­nate devel­op­ment was coloni­sa­tion and the two world wars in the 20th cen­tury. The bib­li­cal story of the Tower of Ba­bel (Gen. 11: 1-9) demon­strates to us the hope­less con­fu­sion of lan­guages and the in­abil­ity of na­tions to live with each other in peace. This tower was a sym­bol of pride and ar­ro­gance. It was an at­tempt to have to­tal­i­tar­ian and ab­so­lute power. “There the Lord con­fused the speech of all the world. It was from that place that [God] scat­tered them all over the world.”(Gen. 11: 9). The world was one and hu­man­ity was one and the same ev­ery­where, and yet they lacked unity. The ba­sic con­cepts of hu­man dig­nity, hu­man rights (free­dom, equal­ity and fra­ter­nity) as pro­pounded by philoso­phers and the­olo­gians were ac­cepted uni­ver­sally only very slowly. War and vi­o­lence were not ques­tioned. They were re­garded as types of be­hav­iour nat­u­ral to hu­man be­ings. Mil­i­tary tech­nol­ogy (drones, nu­clear ar­ma­ment, fighter planes) has be­come ex­tremely so­phis­ti­cated. Times of peace, un­der­stood as ab­sence of war, are the re­sult of mu­tual de­ter­rence with ever greater ar­se­nals of weapons on all sides, and the fear of mu­tual self­de­struc­tion and an­ni­hi­la­tion. But wars and armed vi­o­lence are now so ex­ces­sive that more and more peo­ple on this war-torn earth ask how hu­man­ity can rid it­self of this im­mense evil. Ei­ther we put an end to war­fare or else hu­man­ity will com­mit col­lec­tive sui­cide. For the first time peo­ples and na­tions of the world made an at­tempt af­ter World War 1 (1914-18) to cre­ate a uni­ver­sal po­lit­i­cal body where di­a­logue was sup­posed to make de­struc­tive war­fare un­nec­es­sary, the League of Na­tions, which was suc­ceeded by the United Na­tions af­ter World War II, (1939-45). We need uni­ver­sal stan­dards of hu­man rights and a com­mon un­der­stand­ing of the dig­nity of the hu­man be­ing, of man and woman, and of the right to life. For this we need di­a­logue be­tween peo­ples, cul­tures and re­li­gions. Abuse of the en­vi­ron­ment can only be over­come by world­wide joint ac­tion. Health is threat­ened by many con­ta­gious diseases and even non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases like can­cer, heart diseases, di­a­betes. We must share freely our knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence in cur­ing such diseases, and stop them from spread­ing. We can only do this if we act as one hu­man fam­ily. Cli­mate change is an­other cri­sis which we can only over­come as a united and rec­on­ciled hu­man­ity. More and more or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­sti­tu­tions have been cre­ated to coun­ter­act th­ese con­di­tions, eg the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( WTO), the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion ( WHO), the In­ter­nal Court of Jus­tice (Den Hague), UNESCO (Ed­u­ca­tion), and oth­ers. The with­drawal by the United States from some of th­ese bod­ies is a se­vere set­back (In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice, Agree­ment on Cli­mate Change, World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion). Na­tion States alone can no longer cope with th­ese chal­lenges by them­selves. No one State can solve the prob­lem of mass mi­gra­tion. Pope Fran­cis is propos­ing “some form of world au­thor­ity ... equipped with the power to pro­vide for the global com­mon good, the elim­i­na­tion of hunger and poverty and the sure de­fence of hu­man rights” ( Ecycli­cal let­ter “Fratelli Tutti”, no 172). Po­lit­i­cal free­dom and full em­ploy­ment will re­duce mi­gra­tion. How­ever, the right to free move­ment must be up­held. In the mean­time, we have to wel­come strangers. The Is­raelites were told, “You shall not mo­lest or op­press an alien, for you were once aliens your­selves in the land of Egypt” (Ex 22: 21). Peo­ple who “fol­low nar­row forms of na­tion­al­ism ... think that by clos­ing their doors they will be bet­ter pro­tected. Im­mi­grants are seen as usurpers who have noth­ing to of­fer” (no 141). Ev­ery­thing and ev­ery­body is con­nected with ev­ery­thing and ev­ery­body else. No­body can go it alone. The no­tion “Ev­ery­one for him­self” will soon de­gen­er­ate into a ‘free-for-all’ that would prove worse than any pan­demic (no 36). We need to re­call the wis­dom of our an­ces­tors and of the tra­di­tion that has built our world. South­ern Africa has the “Ubuntu”-phi­los­o­phy (Shona: “unhu”). It can be sum­marised in “I am be­cause we are”. “Ubuntu/unhu is the be­lief in a uni­ver­sal bond of shar­ing that con­nects hu­man­ity”. “We are part of one an­other, we are brothers and sis­ters of one an­other”. “No one is saved alone, we can only be saved to­gether”. “Each of us is fully a per­son when we are part of a peo­ple”, said Pope Fran­cis. The COVID-19 pan­demic re­minds us that we are in­ter­con­nected. The virus is ev­ery­where and the pan­demic is a catas­tro­phe for all of us, any­where in the world, the whole of hu­man­ity is af­fected and in­fected. There­fore, we have to act to­gether as one in sol­i­dar­ity. What hurts you, hurts me as well. If my neigh­bour is sick and in­jured I am wounded as well. Poverty any­where in the world im­pov­er­ishes all hu­mankind. “Dou­bly poor are those women who en­dure sit­u­a­tions of ex­clu­sion, mis­treat­ment and vi­o­lence, since they are fre­quently less able to de­fend their rights” (Fran­cis, no 23). They suf­fer in hu­man traf­fick­ing and as slaves in the “sex in­dus­try”. The story of the “Good Samar­i­tan” is about the love of the neigh­bour. It asks the ques­tion, “Who is my neigh­bour?” The an­swer is, “Any­body in need, even the for­eigner and alien”. Mi­gra­tion is caused by cor­rup­tion, bad gov­er­nance, oppression, vi­o­lence and war­fare. We need to be able to stop mis­use of po­lit­i­cal power in States. Mi­grants may en­rich us. “The poor are not dan­ger­ous”. “Mi­grants must be in­te­grated in re­ceiv­ing coun­tries, while pro­mot­ing the devel­op­ment of their coun­tries of ori­gin through poli­cies in­spired by sol­i­dar­ity” (no 132). I can feed one hun­gry per­son as an act of pri­vate char­ity. But po­lit­i­cal char­ity can change the con­di­tions that cause famine. Re­build­ing our farm­ing in­dus­try would be such an eco­nomic act of char­ity for the com­mon good Na­tional sovereignty is no longer our supreme value. We have to cross bor­ders and meet for­eign cul­tures and peo­ples. We have to build the com­mon good of all the world which we share as brothers and sis­ters. Nar­row-minded na­tion­al­ism is on the rise again. “Amer­ica first,” is now a party slo­gan in the US. Such col­lec­tive self­ish­ness and na­tion­al­is­tic fa­nati­cism have causes many wars. The Euro­pean Union was formed to serve as a strong link be­tween for­mer en­e­mies in one com­mon­wealth where there would be no more war. Now Brexit (Bri­tain’s exit) is bring­ing na­tion­al­ism back again. But that should not de­ter us from work­ing to­wards our African Union. It would be an­other step to­wards unity as brothers and sis­ters, as friends across bor­ders, in Africa and the whole world.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20180624,For­eign investors in re­newed con­fi­dence,"FOR­EIGN investors have re­newed their buoy­ancy in the coun­try’s eco­nomic poli­cies which has re­sulted in them chan­nelling funds to as­sist in var­i­ous de­vel­op­men­tal pro­grammes as they feel their in­vest­ments will be worth­while and safe. This was re­vealed by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa when ad­dress­ing thou­sands of peo­ple gath­ered at White City Sta­dium for a Zanu-PF star rally. The Pres­i­dent said since his in­au­gu­ra­tion in Novem­ber last year he had em­pha­sised the need for the coun­try to fo­cus on re­viv­ing the coun­try’s econ­omy and de­vel­op­ment, re­veal­ing that he was pleased that was yield­ing re­sults to an ex­tent that coun­tries like China and the United States were com­ing in to as­sist in key de­vel­op­men­tal is­sues. “As we in­tend to in­dus­tri­alise, it is nec­es­sary that we en­sure that there is en­ergy so in that re­gard we con­cluded Kariba South Ex­ten­sion which added 300 megawatts to the na­tional grid. Dur­ing my visit to China I also se­cured a loan of $1,2 bil­lion which will be used to re­ha­bil­i­tate unit seven and eight of Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion. “We are also developing Ba­toka Gorge, which will give us 2 400 megawatts which we will, how­ever, be shar­ing with Zam­bia. De­spite the fact that USA has ZEDERA sanc­tions against us, the sig­nals com­ing out of Wash­ing­ton cur­rently are pos­i­tive be­cause at Ba­toka Gorge we are work­ing with Gen­eral Elec­tric, one of the big­gest com­pa­nies in the US. Oth­er­wise Pres­i­dent Trump can turn up to be a very good guy,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. He said when he took over power he had pushed the mantra of Zim­babwe be­ing open for busi­ness, and he said his ad­min­is­tra­tion and him­self made sure that they in­form their Sadc part­ners and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. “As we spread to the world our new thrust we for­tu­nately had the Davos Con­fer­ence where all in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions of im­por­tance as­sem­ble. All lead­ers of pow­er­ful na­tions of the First World met at Davos to dis­cuss noth­ing but wealth, the cre­ation of wealth. So I said the voice of Zim­babwe must be heard in this fo­rum where the big­gest voices of wealth gath­ered and the voice of Zim­babwe dom­i­nated. “Our for­eign pol­icy em­pha­sises the need to en­gage and re-en­gage, of which we mean that we now want to have new friends on board, with re­gard to re-en­gag­ing we are say­ing those coun­tries that had dis­en­gaged with us in the past, we say to you, come back we re-en­gage,” said the Pres­i­dent. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said the thrust now was to cre­ate a mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030, with a capita of US$3 500, en­sur­ing that the coun­try frees it­self from poverty. He said in or­der to cre­ate wealth the strat­egy was to iden­tify en­ablers that will see the econ­omy classed in var­i­ous cat­e­gories which in­clude; agri­cul­ture, min­ing, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, en­ergy, tourism and ICT. “We have a way of developing each par­tic­u­lar sec­tor. With re­gards to agri­cul­ture the first thing that comes to mind is that this coun­try must feed it­self. We have enough land and wa­ter in this coun­try hence we must be able to mod­ernise our agri­cul­ture and make each hectare pro­duc­tive so that we have enough grain to feed our­selves and in the process also have ex­cess for ex­port. In this area the ques­tion of hunger is be­hind us, this na­tion will never again see hunger. “We also have a model for the min­ing sec­tor where we went to the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China where we were given a fa­cil­ity of $100 mil­lion to deal with the ques­tion of em­pow­er­ing our il­le­gal min­ers, who from now on we should re­fer to as small-scale min­ers,” he said. e Pres­i­dent said while the coun­try had a lot of min­er­als the prob­lem was that it did not have the ca­pac­ity to ex­tract all the min­er­als there­fore there is a need for them to ap­peal for for­eign in­vest­ment which he noted would only come if the investors felt their in­vest­ment is safe and pro­tected.",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170615,Eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment lessons from Xi’s book,"THIS week we pub­lish a chap­ter from Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s book ti­tled “Up and Out of Poverty”. The chap­ter ti­tled “Eco­nomic Cho­rus” is based on a speech Pres­i­dent Xi made in 1988 when he was work­ing in Ningde Per­fec­ture, then one of Fu­jian Prov­ince’s im­pov­er­ished re­gions. Other chap­ters in the fa­mous book in­clude “How Can a Weak Hatch­ling Bird be First to Fly?”, “The Ba­sic Pro­fi­ciency of Of­fi­cials”, “Clean Govern­ment is the His­tor­i­cal Mis­sion of Com­mu­nists” and “A Chat About En­ter­ing Pub­lic Ser­vice”. There are also other in­ter­est­ing chap­ters in the book like “Al­ways Keep the Peo­ple in Mind”, “Wa­ter Dro­plets Drilling Through Rock”, “Seize New Op­por­tu­ni­ties”, “Jour­nal­ism: Mas­ter­ing the Fun­da­men­tals” and “How Should We Run Ed­u­ca­tion”. African coun­tries can draw lessons on eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment from the in­ci­sive chap­ter in the book, which ex­alts the need for unity as a pre­req­ui­site for de­vel­op­ment. Pres­i­dent Xi’s book laid the de­vel­op­ment base for Ningde Per­fec­ture and his the­o­ries were repli­cated in other im­pov­er­ished parts of China. Through­out the book, Pres­i­dent Xi sticks to the theme of how a coun­try or re­gion can take it­self out of poverty and at­tain mod­ern econ­omy sta­tus. The book is a must-read for de­vel­op­ment en­thu­si­asts, who as­pire to un­der­stand how China at­tained the global gi­ant sta­tus within a short pe­riod, ris­ing to be­come the sec­ond big­gest econ­omy in the world. Be­low is what Pres­i­dent Xi wrote in the chap­ter on “Eco­nomic Cho­rus”: Each song, each tune, has a theme. When peo­ple hear the fa­mil­iar theme, they know which song or tune it is. The theme is the sub­ject of the song, as well as its soul. There is a theme, too, in the var­i­ous as­pects of work in a place: so­cial­ist eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Once on an in­spec­tion of a town­ship in Ningde, I saw that the lo­cal govern­ment of­fice’s walls were hung with nu­mer­ous award ban­ners for achiev­ing ‘Ex­cel­lence’ and be­ing ‘Num­ber One’ in many ar­eas of work. Un­for­tu­nately, how­ever, none of them had any­thing to do with eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Here it is worth ask­ing: Can we say that there was a theme? I think not! Hang­ing up so many award ban­ners with­out one for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment was not very im­pres­sive. To put it more po­litely, it re­flected work­ing hard with­out per­form­ing a true ser­vice. Work­ing with­out set­ting pri­or­i­ties and stick­ing to the fun­da­men­tals is sim­ply tin­ker­ing. To sing in uni­son, a choir must fo­cus on the theme and the rhythm. The same is true of eco­nomic work. If ev­ery en­try only stresses the im­por­tance of its own work, each fol­low­ing its own score and singing a dif­fer­ent tune, the per­for­mance will in­evitably fail. So, we must ad­vo­cate an eco­nomic cho­rus. Such a cho­rus must have a con­duc­tor. The con­duc­tor at the lo­cal level is the Party (Com­mu­nist Party of China) com­mit­tee and govern­ment. Mod­ern so­ci­ety has en­tered an era of large economies and mass pro­duc­tion. At­ten­tion must be paid to all as­pects of plan­ning, re­search, pro­duc­tion, trans­porta­tion, sales and ser­vice. The fail­ure of any as­pect will re­sult in the in­ter­rup­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, a weak link will be­come a bot­tle­neck in de­vel­op­ment, af­fect­ing nor­mal ac­tiv­ity. The work of the var­i­ous de­part­ments and units par­tic­i­pat­ing in the “cho­rus” is quite com­plex, with dif­fer­ent in­stru­ments and voices. “The big strings plang-plang like swift-falling rain; the lit­tle strings went buzz-buzz like gen­tle whis­pers”, nev­er­the­less, they must fol­low the con­duct­ing of the Party and the govern­ment. We must all sing to­gether, fo­cus­ing on the theme of eco­nomic work. No mat­ter whether the cho­rus is “clas­si­cal” or “pop”, as long as there is a theme and a rhythm, it has an artis­tic ap­peal. Oth­er­wise with the party com­mit­tee singing one tune, the peo­ple’s congress choos­ing an­other, the peo­ple’s po­lit­i­cal con­sul­ta­tive con­fer­ence singing a dif­fer­ent tune and the govern­ment singing yet an­other, there can be noth­ing but ca­coph­ony and this place will cer­tainly not sing its song well. An “eco­nomic cho­rus” re­quires co­or­di­na­tion and co­op­er­a­tion. It will not have a theme only, but not work to­gether or even worse, en­gage in in­ter­nal fric­tion and dis­cord. We must mo­bilise en­thu­si­asm in each de­part­ment and ev­ery as­pect. Since it is a cho­rus, all de­part­ments must con­sciously co­op­er­ate and take the ini­tia­tive to co­or­di­nate. This is not a sim­ple “1+1=2” for­mula; what we want is “1+1&gt;2”, which is of­ten called the ben­e­fit of in­te­gra­tion. Let’s com­pare it to a soccer match. In high-level world soccer com­pe­ti­tion to­day, fo­cus­ing only on per­sonal skills and in­di­vid­ual foot­work is no longer the pre­vail­ing trend. Scor­ing re­lies mainly on the or­ganic co­op­er­a­tion of the play­ers and co­or­di­na­tion is now an im­por­tant as­pect of tac­ti­cal aware­ness on the soccer field. A fa­mous soccer com­men­ta­tor said with re­gards to Ar­gentina’s painful loss in the 12th World Cup fi­nal: “As a star player, Maradona fo­cused only on the in­di­vid­ual and not the col­lec­tive. “The in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic style of the Ar­gen­tine star ul­ti­mately re­sulted in their loss of this World Cup cham­pi­onship.” Soccer fans of­ten crit­i­cise some play­ers for drib­bling too much” be­cause they dis­like it when play­ers show off their own skills, which dam­ages or­ganic co­op­er­a­tion and misses op­por­tu­ni­ties to score. In lo­cal eco­nomic work, all de­part­ments at dif­fer­ent lev­els — up­per and lower, re­lated and un­re­lated — must form an in­te­grated whole. Each de­part­ment has a rel­a­tive in­de­pen­dence, but is part of the whole and can­not be sep­a­rated from the whole or cut off re­la­tions with other de­part­ments. “To see (only) one hair of a thoroughbred horse is not to know its shape; to see (only) one colour of a paint­ing is not to know its beauty”. Any de­part­ment act­ing as a “lone wolf” is work­ing against the in­te­grated strat­egy. Ev­ery of­fi­cial should be aware that if you have a place in the cho­rus, you have a duty to co­op­er­ate. For the eco­nomic cho­rus to have strong artis­tic value, it must ad­here to cho­ral dis­ci­pline, as well as to tech­nique.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180716,AC­CESS TO CLEAN EN­ERGY: WHAT ROLE COULD THE CHI­NESE PLAY?:,"HY­DRO-power al­ready ac­counts for about two thirds of the coun­try’s in­ter­nal elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion, but thou­sands of peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly those in ru­ral ar­eas, still go without power ev­ery day. Much of the prob­lem is due to a lack of in­vest­ment in the en­ergy sec­tor, the power im­port bur­den and users de­fault­ing on elec­tric­ity bills. But things are start­ing to change. The $533 mil­lion expansion of the Kariba Hy­dropower Sta­tion added a huge amount of elec­tric­ity to the na­tional grid, bring­ing ca­pac­ity at the plant to a to­tal 1,050MW. It is one of the largest in­vest­ments in en­ergy in Zim­babwe over the past three decades, funded by the Chi­nese, an emerg­ing key fi­nancier of clean en­ergy projects across Africa. The Kariba works rep­re­sent a key step in the de­liv­ery of ac­cess to elec­tric­ity in Zim­babwe, in line with the UN’s Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goal (SDGs) num­ber seven. Launched in 2015, the SDGs out­line 17 spe­cific goals and 169 tar­gets cov­er­ing cli­mate change, poverty, in­equal­ity, sus­tain­able devel­op­ment and others. Ac­cord­ing to the UN, Goal seven seeks to “en­sure ac­cess to af­ford­able, re­li­able, sus­tain­able and mod­ern en­ergy.”. It is not clear how many house­holds have been con­nected af­ter com­ple­tion of the expansion at Kariba. But hy­dropower could help de­liver a new world of clean and cheap power to the mil­lions of Zim­bab­weans in ru­ral ar­eas without power. Only about 13 per­cent of the more than 7,5 mil­lion peo­ple who live in ru­ral ar­eas here have ac­cess to elec­tric­ity of any kind, of­fi­cial data shows. Over­all, stud­ies by the Uni­ver­sity of Zim­babwe show that more than 60 per­cent of cit­i­zens are not con­nected to the elec­tric­ity grid. Blended price, trans­for­ma­tive change On pric­ing, the ef­fect of Kariba may not be di­rect, yet suf­fi­ciently ef­fec­tive for the con­sumer to feel the dif­fer­ence. State-run power util­ity Zesa Hold­ings pays about 4 cents per Kilo­watt-hour (KWh) for elec­tric­ity gen­er­ated from hy­dro at the Kariba elec­tric power plant. That com­pares with about 18 cents/KWh paid to South African power com­pany Eskom for elec­tric­ity im­ports. By dou­bling hy­dropower gen­er­a­tion Zim­babwe is not only try­ing to keep the fi­nal sell­ing price of elec­tric­ity low - which in ef­fect re­flects a blend of dif­fer­ent prices from dif­fer­ent power sup­pli­ers - but also help keep the lights on in many homes coun­try­wide, new con­nec­tions and old ones. Zim­bab­weans cur­rently pay about 40 per­cent less for elec­tric­ity com­pared to the re­gional av­er­age, though a low rate of elec­tri­fi­ca­tion in ru­ral ar­eas could pose sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges to­wards as­sist­ing peo­ple in those ar­eas to cope with cli­mate change and it’s side­kick, poverty. In­creased ac­cess to re­new­able en­ergy is widely seen as a key buf­fer to cli­mate and eco­nomic shocks and dif­fi­cul­ties. Grid con­nec­tions are trans­for­ma­tive, but Zim­babwe and Africa, both re­liant on agri­cul­ture to drive eco­nomic growth and to sus­tain liveli­hoods, will have to go a step fur­ther, says Dumisani Chi­rambo, a re­searcher with a Ger­man uni­ver­sity. “Africa ar­guably needs more projects that can im­prove ru­ral elec­tri­fi­ca­tion and link en­ergy ac­cess to agri­cul­ture devel­op­ment,” Chi­rambo states, in a new study on the po­ten­tial of re­new­ables in the con­ti­nent. “But in the status quo most projects just fo­cus on in­creas­ing gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­ity and na­tional elec­tri­fi­ca­tion rates, thereby in­ad­ver­tently lead­ing to higher elec­tri­fi­ca­tion rates in ur­ban ar­eas and higher lev­els of vul­ner­a­bil­ity in ru­ral ar­eas,” he said . Chi­rambo sug­gests that “a pos­si­ble way to over­come this might be to urge pol­icy mak­ers in the global south to make pro­vi­sions for cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion fo­cused pro­grammes to have spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion to di­vert more re­sources to the least elec­tri­fied and least at­trac­tive en­ergy sec­tor in­vest­ment coun­tries.” Off-grid clean en­ergy sup­ply in ru­ral ar­eas has ex­panded rapidly in Zim­babwe in re­cent years. Thou­sands of homes have con­nected to PV so­lar mainly for light­ing, while pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor - led projects in small hy­dropower and bio­gas are be­ing used in clin­ics, schools and house­holds for cook­ing and light­ing. It is such smaller ini­tia­tives that hold more prom­ise for fast track­ing elec­tric­ity ac­cess to­wards achiev­ing SDG 7, en­hanc­ing so­cial and eco­nomic progress and tack­ling cli­mate change. The expansion at Kariba dove­tails with Zim­babwe’s com­mit­ments un­der the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change, to cut car­bon emis­sions by 33 per­cent by 2030, mostly through in­creased in­vest­ment in hy­dro and so­lar power, im­proved en­ergy ef­fi­ciency and trans­port ef­fi­ciency. To do that, the coun­try needs about $55 bil­lion in in­ter­na­tional aid for mit­i­ga­tion only, with a small frac­tion of this amount funded by Gov­ern­ment. Fund­ing night­mare But global fi­nance, which tends to favour emission re­duc­ing projects, has not flowed at the scale needed to drive real change in the de­vel­op­ing world, par­tic­u­larly Africa. Chi­rambo says up to $100 bil­lion is re­quired each year to drive the re­new­able en­ergy rev­o­lu­tion in Africa south of the Sa­hara, where more than 600 mil­lion peo­ple are without elec­tric­ity, but only about 5 per­cent of the money comes through. That’s largely due to in­ad­e­quate fund­ing from tra­di­tional fi­nanciers in the West, per­haps a lack of com­mit­ment, strin­gent fund­ing re­quire­ments that are usu­ally tied with hu­man rights demands, and other fac­tors. The US’ Power Africa ini­tia­tive from a few years ago, which has missed its clean en­ergy de­liv­ery tar­gets by a coun­try mile, meet­ing just a fifth of its fund­ing tar­gets, is par­tic­u­larly no­table for link­ing its en­ergy fi­nance to hu­man rights is­sues. Only four coun­tries in Africa have suc­cess­fully pre­pared the in­vest­ment prospec­tus, the last re­quire­ment in a fairly long list of rig­or­ous demands for fund­ing un­der the UN’s Sus­tain­able En­ergy for All Ini­tia­tive. But China could be of help. The Asian coun­try now plays an im­por­tant role in world af­fairs, not only in driv­ing FDI in Africa, but also fi­nance specif­i­cally de­signed to tackle cli­mate change, Chi­rambo says. China has in­creased cli­mate fund­ing un­der its China SouthSouth Cli­mate Co­op­er­a­tion Fund for Cli­mate Change to $3,1 bil­lion from about $50 mil­lion a year. That’s in ad­di­tion to the $2 bil­lion it was pay­ing un­der the South-South Co­op­er­a­tion. And the funds are usu­ally without strings at­tached. Zim­babwe needs to claim its share from the funds by draft­ing bank­able clean en­ergy projects. God is faith­ful.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20171126,Time for se­ri­ous talks with global fi­nanciers,"THE lo­cal mar­kets are starved of cap­i­tal — fresh cap­i­tal, to be pre­cise. It is this cap­i­tal deficit that is it­self in cash short­ages for the gen­er­al­ity of the pop­u­la­tion, and under-cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion for in­dus­try. Though the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe (RBZ) has been in­vest­ing a lot of ef­forts to try and stim­u­late pro­duc­tion and ex­ports through var­i­ous mone­tary in­cen­tives, it is not, how­ever, clear whether this has the po­ten­tial to ar­rest the cur­rent cri­sis that we have in the mar­ket. In­cen­tives for Di­as­pora re­mit­tances, to­bacco and cot­ton farm­ers, in­clud­ing sup­port fa­cil­i­ties for the sup­ply side of the econ­omy, have gone a long way in stim­u­lat­ing pro­duc­tion. How­ever, it is ar­guable that if Zim­babwe had nor­mal re­la­tions with in­ter­na­tional fi­nanciers, it would have been able to get bridg­ing finance and bal­ance of pay­ment sup­port to avert fes­ter­ing prob­lems in the mar­ket. This is pre­cisely the rea­son why Gov­ern­ment should not tire in pur­su­ing the Lima plan in or­der to un­lock fresh sources of cap­i­tal. The Lima debt and ar­rears clearance strat­egy, which was hatched two years ago, is premised on the cru­cial need to re­pay the ar­rears owed par­tic­u­larly to big in­ter­na­tional fi­nanciers such as the World Bank, African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) and the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF). Al­ready, the ar­rears owed to the IMF have been cleared. What is now left are ar­rears owed to the WB and AfDB, which amount to $1,6 bil­lion. It seems as if Gov­ern­ment has slack­ened in its re­solve to see the plan through. This must now change. It is noth­ing short of ab­surd to ex­pect the coun­try to ex­tri­cate it­self from the cur­rent eco­nomic cir­cum­stances with­out for­eign cap­i­tal. How can this be pos­si­ble when Gov­ern­ment wages gob­ble up more than 80 per­cent of the na­tional bud­get? This is surely not a healthy po­si­tion. Whilst it is a very good ini­tia­tive to em­power Zim­bab­weans, in­vestor con­cerns should not be ig­nored. Also, while the in­di­geni­sa­tion and eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment pol­icy is pru­dent, it needs to be tam­pered with pra­grama­tism. It doesn’t mat­ter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice, the Chi­nese of­ten say. All that mat­ters is the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try. It is en­cour­ag­ing that the Of­fice of the Pres­i­dent and Cab­i­net has al­ready be­gun pro­cesses meant to make the lo­cal business en­vi­ron­ment as at­trac­tive as it ought to be. This needs to be done ex­pe­di­tiously. Yes, we might have boun­ti­ful re­sources in Zim­babwe, but we have not been able to ex­ploit them to the ben­e­fit of the peo­ple. We need in­vestors from Bri­tain, Amer­ica, China and ev­ery other coun­try which wants to help us de­velop. It is time for Zim­babwe to rise, again. There is need to start work­ing to­wards the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try. As the coun­try opens a new chap­ter, Gov­ern­ment needs to know that what most or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans need is a job that pays a living wage. It is about time that Gov­ern­ment be­gins work­ing on cre­at­ing a vi­brant mid­dle class, which is crit­i­cal to spurring vi­able eco­nomic growth. If this is achieved, all other things will work them­selves out. Most of the ven­dors will nat­u­rally dis­ap­pear on the streets and reap­pear in re-opened in­dus­tries. So the onus is on us to cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment where po­ten­tial in­vestors can come into the coun­try and in­vest freely with­out hur­dles. It is point­less for some­one to in­vest mil­lions of dol­lars with­out get­ting a mean­ing­ful re­turn. There must be a very good re­turn on in­vest­ment for one to in­vest in our coun­try. Sta­bil­ity is also very crit­i­cal, be­cause it is point­less for one to in­vest large sums of money in a des­ti­na­tion that is volatile. All this needs to be at­tended to. How­ever, the grand plan should be to lift peo­ple out of poverty. And for­eign in­vest­ment truly makes a dif­fer­ence to peo­ple living in poverty. It pro­vides ac­cess to ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties and pro­vides peo­ple es­sen­tial con­di­tions for living a peace­ful and se­cure life. What we need now is to re­duce in­equal­i­ties, in­crease eco­nomic growth and im­prove the living con­di­tions of those in poverty. Tied to the need to clear ar­rears in or­der to un­lock fund­ing is also the need to tidy Gov­ern­ment’s fi­nances — both for lo­cal and cen­tral Gov­ern­ment. If they are trans­par­ent enough, it could be pos­si­ble for Gov­ern­ment and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to raise funds on in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. Only last week, Nigeria raised a $3 bil­lion bond, which was warmly re­ceived by the mar­ket. It only shows that there is def­i­nitely an ap­petite for de­vel­op­ing mar­kets. Zim­bab­weans have surely en­dured tough times for decades and many had to leave the coun­try to se­cure bet­ter prospects. All the cap­i­tal which was drained from Zim­babwe needs to be re­cov­ered and even more. Now that many Zim­bab­weans are now hope­ful of the fu­ture, this hope does not need to be squan­dered; it has to be har­nessed for the com­mon good of the coun­try. Ev­ery Zim­bab­wean now needs to play a part in re­viv­ing the econ­omy of our beau­ti­ful coun­try. Only good, vi­able eco­nomic poli­cies can be the an­swer.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20181125,China joins hunger fight:,"WERE it not for the roam­ing and preda­tory rep­tiles called crocodiles, res­i­dents at Ton­gog­ara Refugee Camp would lit­er­ally live in the mighty Save River, cush­ion­ing them­selves from the swel­ter­ing heat that char­ac­terise the Mid­dle Sabi. But the heat, which on the day in ques­tion could have eas­ily tipped 34 on the mer­cury scales, is the least of their wor­ries. Com­ing from the DRC, So­ma­lia, Ethiopia, Bu­rundi, Rwanda, coun­tries whose av­er­age trop­i­cal cli­matic con­di­tions make the Mid­dle Sabi feel like some po­lar re­gion, their im­me­di­ate wor­ries are usu­ally wel­fare-re­lated. China Aid, a grow­ing brand in global hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance, was in town and the refugees, some 13 000 of them drawn from across 15 na­tion­al­i­ties, could, at least for the day, en­dure the heat, wait­ing for what­ever good news the Chi­nese were bring­ing. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment re­cently do­nated $2 mil­lion to Ton­gog­ara Refugee Camp and Tues­day’s cer­e­mony was to hand-over part of the do­na­tion. The World Food Pro­gramme, the im­ple­ment­ing part­ner, rep­re­sented by Mr Niels Balzer, the deputy coun­try di­rec­tor, was in at­ten­dance. So were other UN agen­cies and other non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions that are thriv­ing to make the life of the refugees bear­able on a day-to-day ba­sis. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, through China Aid, was rep­re­sented by the Chi­nese Em­bassy, of which the Eco­nom­ics and Com­mer­cial Coun­sel­lor, Mr Chen Ning, was the guest of hon­our. Zim­babwe is await­ing the sec­ond­ment of an am­bas­sador af­ter the ex­piry of the term of Mr Huang Ping. In his open­ing re­marks, Mr Jo­han Mh­langa, the camp ad­min­is­tra­tor, out­lined the myr­iad of chal­lenges that faces the refugee camp, but said they were not in­sur­mount­able, es­pe­cially with the help of the many or­gan­i­sa­tions that read­ily of­fer their sup­port, try­ing to make the lives of the refugees as bear­able as pos­si­ble. To this end, every month, the refugees re­ceive a cash stipend of $13 per head to meet in­ci­den­tal needs. Mr Balzer said the cash pay-outs go a long way in help­ing restor­ing dig­nity in the lives of refugees. “With this sup­port, WFP is able to pro­vide food as well as cash, al­low­ing you to do what fam­i­lies around the world do every day — de­cide to­gether as a fam­ily what goods to pur­chase and em­pow­er­ing the lo­cal econ­omy,” he said. Be­sides the cash hand-outs, the res­i­dents of the camp re­ceive a range of kind dona­tions, rang­ing from blan­kets, mos­quito nets, san­i­tary pads, to con­sum­ables like rice, cook­ing oil and cow peas. Mr Ning said the hand-over cer­e­mony re­minded him of a sim­i­lar event 20 years ago in China when a poverty-stricken vil­lage was re­ceiv­ing a school from a UN de­vel­op­ment agency. “Decades have passed and tremen­dous changes have taken place in China, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has taken its peo­ple on a rapid de­vel­op­ment that leads to growth in all sec­tors of so­ci­ety and peo­ple’s liveli­hoods,” he re­marked. To this end, he said the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is ever-ready to as­sist Zim­babwe in re­al­is­ing some of its SDGs, es­pe­cially achiev­ing zero hunger. Ini­tially founded as a re­search sta­tion, the refugee camp has un­der­gone some in­ter­est­ing changes over the years. In 1979, when Rhode­sia signed the Lan­caster House agree­ment that ceased hos­til­i­ties with the lib­er­a­tion move­ments, the camp be­came a de­mo­bil­i­sa­tion cen­tre. Dur­ing this pe­riod when Vice Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wengwa was camp com­man­der, the re­search sta­tion was re­named Ton­gog­ara, in rev­er­ence of the army com­man­der who had just been killed in a road ac­ci­dent on the eve of the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dence. Soon af­ter the de­mo­bil­i­sa­tion, the camp closed. Then in 1984, as hos­til­i­ties between Re­n­amo and the Mozam­bi­can gov­ern­ment es­ca­lated, the camp re-opened to take in Mozam­bi­cans who were flee­ing the con­flict. In 1994, with the sign­ing of a peace ac­cord between the war­ring par­ties in Mozam­bique, the refugee camp was closed down as the refugees made their way back home. It was dur­ing this pe­riod that the refugee pop­u­la­tion at the camp peaked 50 000. To share the in­flux of Mozam­bi­can refugees dur­ing this time, Ton­gog­ara op­er­ated along­side Chambuta in Chiredzi, Nyan­gombe in Nyanga and Ma­zowe River Bridge. Af­ter the suc­cess­ful repa­tri­a­tion of Mozam­bi­can na­tion­als, the Ton­gog­ara Refugee Camp closed in 1995, and for the com­ing two years was used as a cen­tre for the dis­abled. Then in 1998, a civil war erupted in the Great Lakes re­gion and the camp opened again, now as a refugee re­treat cen­tre. The long­est-serv­ing res­i­dents at the camp to­day have been res­i­dent there since that 1998 con­flict. Ly­ing on some 870 hectares, the refugee camp en­gages the res­i­dents in self­help projects like soap-mak­ing, arts and crafts, pig­gery and ir­ri­gation schemes, so that their liveli­hoods are not en­tirely re­liant on donor-fund­ing. At the con­clu­sion of the long-day tour of the camp, Mr Ning pledged the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to help up­grade St Michael’s Sec­ondary School to Ad­vanced Level sta­tus. “I urge the camp ad­min­is­tra­tor, with the as­sis­tance of the de­vel­op­ment part­ners here, to make a pro­posal to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment through the rel­e­vant chan­nels and we are keen to as­sist with the up­grad­ing of this school. We have al­ready built a num­ber of schools around Zim­babwe and there is no rea­son why we should not build one with such a wor­thy cause,” he said. With an en­rol­ment of 705, the sec­ondary school has plans to take in A-Level stu­dents so that the refugees can con­tinue with their ed­u­ca­tion at the camp. The sec­ondary school feeds from Ton­gog­ara Pri­mary School, with a stag­ger­ing en­rol­ment of 1 900.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20171015,Donkey abat­toir: Is it don­keys un­der threat or fear of con­sum­ing them,"DON­KEYS are cru­cial for the sur­vival of so many African fam­i­lies, es­pe­cially in ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties where they are com­monly used as an­i­mals of bur­den. The re­cent open­ing of Chi­nese ex­port mar­kets that are fed by lo­cal firms where the de­mand for both donkey meat and hides is grow­ing is likely to in­crease their mar­ket value not only in the coun­try but in the re­gion as well. Although ar­gu­ments and counter ar­gu­ments have of late been fly­ing thick and fast on the sus­tain­abil­ity and suit­abil­ity of the coun­try al­low­ing such com­mer­cial pacts it seems the coun­try is all but ready to do busi­ness in don­keys with Agri­cul­ture, Mech­a­ni­sa­tion and Ir­ri­ga­tion De­vel­op­ment Deputy Min­is­ter Cde Paddy Zhanda de­mand­ing as­sur­ance that the meat would not find its place into the lo­cal mar­ket. In Zim­babwe don­keys are known to be con­cen­trated in the South­ern arid re­gions of the coun­try, ow­ing to their drought re­sis­tant nature. They are not very ex­pen­sive and are lit­tle known for any­thing else medic­i­nal or oth­er­wise other than draw­ing wa­ter carts, fetch­ing fire­wood and many other do­mes­tic du­ties such as plough­ing. They are gen­eral less valu­able in African so­ci­eties. They are un­like cat­tle, sheep and goats that can be kept on a com­mer­cial ba­sis for sup­plies of meat. Don­keys are not eaten in many African so­ci­eties and are never known to be a part of so­cial sta­tus be­cause of the less money they fetch on the mar­ket. Other than Beit­bridge where they are used for smug­gling con­tra­bands and sleek ve­hi­cles across the Lim­popo, don­keys have not been known for any mean­ing­ful com­mer­cial ven­ture. The il­le­gal com­mer­cial ven­ture has raised their value in that part of the coun­try. But with con­firmed re­ports that the coun­try has given the green light to the con­struc­tion of an abat­toir in Bu­l­awayo with a ca­pac­ity to slaugh­ter and dress 70 don­keys a day, a le­gal com­mer­cial mar­ket for the an­i­mal of bur­den has been opened for the first time in the coun­try. The abat­toir, a sub­sidiary of Bat­tle­front In­vest­ments is said to be tar­get­ing the Asian mar­ket, par­tic­u­larly China where donkey prod­ucts are on high de­mand. “We have al­ready started buy­ing don­keys around the coun­try as far as Gokwe, Plumtree, Gwanda and in be­tween Gweru. Our tar­get mar­ket is the Asian mar­ket and I have even em­ployed some Asian peo­ple, Chi­nese peo­ple in par­tic­u­lar,” said Mr Gareth Lums­den who is Bat­tle­front In­vest­ment’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor. He said all the le­gal pro­cesses of clear­ance and move­ment were go­ing to be fol­lowed so that they do not buy stolen don­keys. The set­ting of a slaugh­ter­house has how­ever, raised a lot of dust within the rank and file of so­ci­ety with red flags of in­sen­si­tiv­ity, ex­tinc­tion of the an­i­mal and in­creased poverty in the coun­try’s ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties that rely on them as beasts of bur­den be­ing raised. Depart­ment of Live­stock and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vices deputy di­rec­tor for health Dr Jairus Machakwa said there was no pol­icy per­tain­ing to the slaugh­ter­ing of don­keys as they were not tra­di­tion­ally con­sumed in the coun­try. “A reg­u­la­tion for the slaugh­ter­ing of don­keys is not there be­cause we don’t tra­di­tion­ally con­sume them. It is how­ever, not dif­fi­cult to amend a reg­u­la­tion given that we in­tend to con­sume the meat. So it’s up to the mem­bers of the pub­lic to raise their con­cern,” he said. Zim­babwe joins Kenya in al­low­ing the set­ting up of a donkey abat­toir while other African coun­tries have banned the slaugh­ter and ex­port of don­keys and their prod­ucts to China fear­ing ex­tinc­tion of the an­i­mal and fur­ther im­pov­er­ish­ing their ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties. They also ar­gue that al­low­ing the com­mer­cial trade in don­keys will in­crease thiev­ery in their com­mu­ni­ties as in­creased de­mand from Asian mar­kets will out­strip the le­gal sup­ply. Re­ports are that donkey skins are said to pro­duce gela­tine that is used in tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine called ejiao. Over the last two years, ejiao has be­come pop­u­lar among the Chi­nese who prize it as an anti-ag­ing agent, an aphro­disiac, a cure for in­som­nia or poor cir­cu­la­tion, among other health ben­e­fits. Ac­cord­ing to re­ports, the donkey skin is boiled to pro­duce gela­tine which is used in the man­u­fac­ture of ejiao which is of­ten re­ferred to as a blood tonic. The medicine is good for build­ing up the body and helps with what is known in Chi­nese medicine as “blood de­fi­ciency”, for con­di­tions such as anaemia and heavy pe­ri­ods, as well as ir­ri­tat­ing dry coughs. In­ter­est­ingly, farm­ers in China have at­tempted to meet the in­creased de­mand for ejiao prod­ucts by farm­ing don­keys. This has how­ever, largely been un­suc­cess­ful due to don­keys’ low fer­til­ity. Ejiao pro­duc­ers in China have even lob­bied the gov­ern­ment to sub­sidise donkey breed­ers to sup­ply the ejiao mar­ket and re­duce the short­fall in sup­ply. It is also thought that ar­ti­fi­cial in­sem­i­na­tion and se­lec­tive breed­ing is be­ing used to in­crease don­keys’ re­pro­duc­tion in China where con­sump­tion of donkey meat is a pop­u­lar tra­di­tion in some parts, where it is highly ex­pen­sive. This has called for a some­what global in­crease in the de­mand for don­keys that also stretches into the coun­try, stir­ring de­bate and con­tro­versy. The de­mand is ex­pected to raise the price and the rate of slaugh­ter of the an­i­mals, threat­en­ing the liveli­hoods of poor com­mu­ni­ties who rely on them as an­i­mals of do­mes­tic bur­den. Ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment is­sued in protest of the coun­try’s first abat­toir by Aware Trust Zim­babwe, Vet­eri­nar­i­ans for An­i­mal Wel­fare Zim­babwe, Lu­pane Youth for De­vel­op­ment Trust, the Zim­babwe Na­tional So­ci­ety for the Preven­tion of Cru­elty to An­i­mals and Spana, the coun­try has an es­ti­mated 150 000 don­keys. “Zim­babwe has an es­ti­mated pop­u­la­tion of 150 000 don­keys, spread over the com­mu­nal ar­eas where they are an in­te­gral part of com­mu­nity life. The pro­posed abat­toir in Mata­bele­land has an abil­ity to process 70 an­i­mals per day. If sup­ply meets de­mand, us­ing 300 work­ing days per year, the pop­u­la­tion of don­keys could be de­creased by 21 000 don­keys per year. Don­keys are not suited as in­ten­sive pro­duc­tion an­i­mals, since they have long ges­ta­tion pe­ri­ods, high foal mor­tal­ity, and slow foal de­vel­op­ment rates. “Housed in un­hab­it­u­ated groups, don­keys suf­fer from a stress-in­duced con­di­tion called hy­per­lipemia which can kill them. There is cur­rently no eth­i­cally ac­cept­able method of in­ten­sively farm­ing don­keys, and the de­mand for the skin trade far ex­ceeds the rate at which they can be pro­duced,” reads part of the joint state­ment. They also raised fears of traf­fick­ing of donkey skins which they said was of­ten linked to wildlife crim­i­nal syn­di­cates say­ing le­git­imis­ing the trade could pro­vide new link­ages for wildlife poach­ers. Com­mu­ni­ties in the coun­try have how­ever, re­ceived the news with mixed feel­ings with some say­ing the open­ing of ex­port mar­kets was go­ing to see don­keys get­ting more value and bet­ter treat­ment than they used to get tra­di­tion­ally while oth­ers main­tained their re­luc­tance to trade their work an­i­mals. “There is lit­tle eco­nomic value in trad­ing in the an­i­mal. There are short term ben­e­fits yes, es­pe­cially that the buy­ers use cash which is scarce but there is no long term eco­nomic ben­e­fit. Our don­keys are poorly fed and look mis­er­able so the prices are very low and at times they refuse to take them be­cause they look mis­er­able. “Look­ing at it care­fully one will no­tice that the donkey does work that is worth the $100 to $200 that the guys are of­fer­ing un­less if one is re­ally des­per­ate for cash,” said a Gwanda farmer Mr Melusi Ndlovu. He said although some were ex­cited at the prospect of trad­ing their don­keys there was a real risk of fall­ing into poverty as the don­keys are quite im­por­tant in com­mu­nity life. Mr Ndlovu added that he would not want to get any­where near where a donkey was be­ing slaugh­tered. “I will not want to watch a donkey be­ing killed. What we know is that don­keys die on their own and we bury them. They are just like dogs. But the so­cial in­ter­course with the out­side world is giv­ing us some un­usual ex­pe­ri­ences like we once com­plained when our friends were skin­ning dogs in pub­lic. We are just not used to it and the com­plaints are jus­ti­fied,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200524,Lo­cal value chains cru­cial for grow­ing ex­ports,"— crude oil and im­ported, at higher cost, pro­cessed pe­tro­leum prod­ucts. The Dan­gote Group is con­struct­ing the big­gest in­te­grated oil re­fin­ery and petro­chem­i­cal com­plex in Africa, at a cost US$15 bil­lion (US$10 bil­lion re­fin­ery, US$2,5 bil­lion fer­tiliser plant and US$2,5 bil­lion pipe­line in­fra­struc­ture), cre­at­ing 9 000 di­rect jobs and 25 000 down­stream jobs. With ca­pac­ity to process 650 000 crude oil bar­rels a day, the re­fin­ery is set to trans­form Nige­ria into a pro­ducer and net ex­porter of petro­chem­i­cal prod­ucts and fer­tilis­ers by year 2022. Africa has made great strides in a lot of ar­eas, de­vel­op­ments one would not or­di­nar­ily see in Western main­stream me­dia. The con­ti­nent has made tremen­dous progress in in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, agri­cul­ture, In­for­ma­tion Com­mu­ni­ca­tion Tech­nol­ogy, ed­u­ca­tion, health, arts and sport, among other sec­tors. The face of Africa is rapidly chang­ing — pro­gres­sively re­shap­ing its eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment con­tours. AfDB projects that Africa will be the next growth fron­tier, sur­pass­ing Asia. African coun­tries are look­ing for part­ner­ships else­where after decades of US and Euro­pean Union dom­i­na­tion of global po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ar­chi­tec­ture. African coun­tries now look at Western de­vel­op­ment aid with cau­tion as it per­pet­u­ates the im­pe­ri­al­is­tic donor-re­cip­i­ent, sub­servient legacy. As the bal­ance of power is shift­ing and be­ing coun­ter­bal­anced with the rise of China and other emerg­ing economies such as Rus­sia, In­dia and Brazil, Africa now has op­tions on who it wants to do busi­ness with and un­der what con­di­tions. — Not all doom and gloom The fu­ture of trade is not what we pro­jected it to be. Covid-19 has in­creased the need for na­tions and or­gan­i­sa­tions to shape the next nor­mal. With sup­ply chains dis­rupted across the world, some lo­cal busi­nesses will find the cur­rent busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment chal­leng­ing. This is even worse for those man­u­fac­tur­ers who were de­pen­dent on im­ports for their pro­duc­tion pro­cesses. The im­pact of this also stretches to de­cline in de­mand for var­i­ous prod­ucts such as fur­ni­ture and gen­eral cloth­ing in ex­port mar­kets. The clo­sure of bor­ders to all things other than es­sen­tial prod­ucts by neigh­bour­ing coun­tries such as South Africa, has ad­versely af­fected Zim­babwe along with other coun­tries in the SADC region. Based on the un­pre­dictabil­ity of this pan­demic, it will be a while be­fore coun­tries fully re­store global trade of non-es­sen­tial prod­ucts, which will have neg­a­tive im­pli­ca­tions on lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies that im­port most of their raw ma­te­ri­als. These raw ma­te­ri­als are no longer as ac­ces­si­ble as be­fore, in­di­cat­ing an ur­gent need to de­velop al­ter­na­tive sources. To ad­dress the chal­lenges, it is also im­por­tant to look be­yond the im­me­di­ate cri­sis and start to work around re­quire­ments of the new nor­mal. But what is the new nor­mal? The new nor­mal should place em­pha­sis on de­vel­op­ment and strength­en­ing of lo­cal value chains, which in turn leads to im­port sub­sti­tu­tion, par­tic­u­larly of raw ma­te­ri­als. Given the on­go­ing chal­lenges with sourc­ing im­ports be­cause of travel bans and re­stricted move­ment of cer­tain cargo, the over de­pen­dence on other coun­tries for raw ma­te­ri­als will af­fect pro­duc­tion for most man­u­fac­tur­ers. These bans have re­vealed how much lo­cal play­ers across all sec­tors must de­velop their value chains so that they max­imise rev­enue and cush­ion them­selves from global shocks. For ex­am­ple, In­dia im­posed a ban on ex­ports of many phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal raw ma­te­ri­als in March 2020 which meant com­pa­nies that were im­port­ing from In­dia have been fac­ing short­ages and re­duced pro­duc­tion. The im­pact of such trade bans can be mit­i­gated if lo­cal value chains are de­vel­oped to en­sure the con­sis­tent avail­abil­ity of key prod­ucts that are pro­duced within Zim­bab­wean bor­ders. This means prod­uct value chain stake­hold­ers across all sec­tors should move with speed to en­gage lo­cal sup­pli­ers of each ac­tiv­ity node so that they de­velop ca­pac­i­ties and ac­cel­er­ate the im­port sub­sti­tu­tion drive in or­der to max­imise their ex­port rev­enue. This al­lows busi­nesses to ex­am­ine their ac­tiv­i­ties and iden­tify com­pet­i­tive op­por­tu­ni­ties, such as pro­duc­tion at lower costs, thereby of­fer­ing lower prices to con­sumers and sav­ing more as a com­pany. A value chain can op­ti­mise op­er­a­tional ef­forts, re­duce waste and im­prove prof­itabil­ity. For in­stance, one lo­cal com­pany has re­duced its costs by con­struct­ing a milling plant in Zim­babwe, which has led to re­duced im­ports such as maize grits. By do­ing so, they have also re­duced their risk and re­liance on im­ports and have man­aged to max­imise costs for their fi­nal prod­uct. In most cases, lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers ad­mit there are lo­cal sup­pli­ers who can pro­vide the same prod­uct that they im­port. How­ever, they do not al­ways agree on price and qual­ity. Due to these gaps in the lo­cal value chains, lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers have had to look ex­ter­nally for raw ma­te­ri­als, which could have been sourced lo­cally. Coun­tries in the region, such as South Africa, that have de­vel­oped a strong man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor have done so on the back of solid value chains, with co-oper­a­tion from play­ers in the chain, fi­nanciers and author­i­ties. Across the world, de­vel­op­ment of lo­cal value chains con­trib­ute to eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, par­tic­u­larly through strength­en­ing of lo­cal in­dus­tries and job cre­ation. Where com­mon prob­lems are re­cur­ring, value chains can be used as a di­ag­nos­tic tool to iden­tify crit­i­cal is­sues and block­ages for spe­cific groups and sub­se­quently gen­er­ate ro­bust and ef­fec­tive poli­cies and de­vel­op­ment strate­gies. This will also pro­vide a log­i­cal frame­work to for­mu­late in­ter­ven­tion strate­gies for pro­duc­ers and how to de­velop ca­pac­ity. Fur­ther, value chains are in­her­ently scal­able. Take the Macadamia Grow­ers As­so­ci­a­tion in Chipinge or the Ba­nana Farm­ers As­so­ci­a­tion in Honde Val­ley, for in­stance. The frame­works be­ing utilised can be repli­cated in other in­dus­tries to prop­a­gate eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and re­duce poverty. An­other ex­am­ple is Delta Cor­po­ra­tion Lim­ited, which has been fi­nanc­ing small holder farm­ers un­der the Bev­er­ages Sorghum Con­tract Farm­ing Scheme to in­crease their ca­pac­ity to grow an es­sen­tial prod­uct in their sorghum beer value chain. In 2016, Cairns re­vived an out­grower scheme that ben­e­fited a large num­ber of house­holds in Man­i­ca­land and im­proved lo­cal sup­ply of raw ma­te­ri­als into their pro­duc­tion. The com­pany high­lighted that this move was go­ing to re­duce pro­duc­tion costs by re­duc­ing the im­port bill and make their prod­ucts more af­ford­able. Lo­cal value chain de­vel­op­ment will also en­able iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of core rents and bar­ri­ers to en­try that de­ter­mine who ben­e­fits from pro­duc­tion for di­verse fi­nal mar­kets. Given the afore­men­tioned ad­van­tages, it be­comes clear that some of the eco­nomic chal­lenges Zim­babwe is fac­ing are a re­sult of dys­func­tional value chains, which have seen po­ten­tial rev­enue leak­ing out of the coun­try in the form of raw ma­te­ri­als. Zim­babwe is well-en­dowed with nu­mer­ous min­er­als and re­sources. Re­gret­tably, most of these are ex­ported raw. These nat­u­ral en­dow­ments re­quire full pro­cess­ing to ob­tain max­i­mum value as the un­con­verted raw ma­te­ri­als rep­re­sent less than 10 per­cent of the value of the pro­cessed prod­uct. The real value can then be de­rived in full pro­cess­ing through value chain de­vel­op­ment and in some in­stances en­forc­ing im­port sub­sti­tu­tion tac­tics for lo­cal busi­nesses. For ex­am­ple, the coun­try pro­duces qual­ity trees that can be used for its own pa­per mak­ing as well as tim­ber that can be used to sup­ply the lo­cal fur­ni­ture in­dus­try. Ac­cord­ing to Trade Map, Zim­babwe ex­ported wood and wood char­coal worth US$ 19,4 mil­lion in 2019, up from US$ 14,6 mil­lion in 2018. Dur­ing the same time, the coun­try im­ported pa­per and pa­per­board worth US$ 89,3 mil­lion, down from US$ 116,6 mil­lion in 2018. These sta­tis­tics in­di­cate that the coun­try is los­ing money through im­por­ta­tion of prod­ucts made from tim­ber. This money could have been saved and pri­ori­tised for other de­vel­op­ment projects if the tim­ber value chain was fully de­vel­oped, from tim­ber ex­trac­tion to pa­per pro­duc­tion. An­other ex­am­ple is the lo­cal leather sec­tor where some shoe man­u­fac­tur­ers im­port their leather from as far as Italy. The ma­jor rea­son for sourc­ing from for­eign sup­pli­ers, they say, is that such leather is of high qual­ity and farm­ers in those coun­tries take good care of the cat­tle. In coun­tries such as Italy, In­dia and Sin­ga­pore that are big in ex­port of raw leather, they have well-co­or­di­nated value chains where the cat­tle farmer, tan­ner­ies and man­u­fac­tur­ers work closely to pro­duce the best prod­uct. Un­like the lo­cal in­dus­try which does not fully utilise the role of the farmer in the leather value chain, in other coun­tries, the farmer is an in­te­gral stake­holder in the en­tire value chain as his out­put de­ter­mines the qual­ity of what the en­tire leather in­dus­try pro­duces. So, if the stake­hold­ers in the lo­cal leather value chain can or­gan­ise them­selves, from farm­ers, tan­ner­ies and shoe man­u­fac­tur­ers, the po­ten­tial is high that the coun­try can pro­duce an equally com­pet­i­tive pro­cessed leather. This in turn will re­sult in im­port sub­sti­tu­tion, which in turn will save the coun­try the much-needed for­eign cur­rency, cre­ate jobs and im­prove the liveli­hoods of Zim­bab­weans.",津巴布韦

The res­o­lu­tion is ex­pected to be put to a vote on Tues­day. — AP HERSHEY — US pres­i­den­tial foes Hil­lary Clinton and Don­ald Trump bran­dished ri­val vi­sions of Amer­ica on Fri­day and the world held its breath as they headed into a fierce fi­nal week­end of cam­paign­ing. Fore­casts based on polling av­er­ages still give the Democrat an edge over the 70-year-old prop­erty mogul but the Repub­li­can has been buoyed by signs that he is clos­ing the gap in key swing states. So both headed on Fri­day to the in­dus­trial north­east, where blue-col­lar vot­ers that were once re­li­able Democrats may be tempted by Trump’s pro­tec­tion­ist prom­ise to repa­tri­ate jobs from Mex­ico and China.

But the heat, which on the day in ques­tion could have eas­ily tipped 34 on the mer­cury scales, is the least of their wor­ries. Com­ing from the DRC, So­ma­lia, Ethiopia, Bu­rundi, Rwanda, coun­tries whose av­er­age trop­i­cal cli­matic con­di­tions make the Mid­dle Sabi feel like some po­lar re­gion, their im­me­di­ate wor­ries are usu­ally wel­fare-re­lated. China Aid, a grow­ing brand in global hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance, was in town and the refugees, some 13 000 of them drawn from across 15 na­tion­al­i­ties, could, at least for the day, en­dure the heat, wait­ing for what­ever good news the Chi­nese were bring­ing. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment re­cently do­nated $2 mil­lion to Ton­gog­ara Refugee Camp and Tues­day’s cer­e­mony was to hand-over part of the do­na­tion. The World Food Pro­gramme, the im­ple­ment­ing part­ner, rep­re­sented by Mr Niels Balzer, the deputy coun­try di­rec­tor, was in at­ten­dance. So were other UN agen­cies and other non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions that are thriv­ing to make the life of the refugees bear­able on a day-to-day ba­sis. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, through China Aid, was rep­re­sented by the Chi­nese Em­bassy, of which the Eco­nom­ics and Com­mer­cial Coun­sel­lor, Mr Chen Ning, was the guest of hon­our. Zim­babwe is await­ing the sec­ond­ment of an am­bas­sador af­ter the ex­piry of the term of Mr Huang Ping. In his open­ing re­marks, Mr Jo­han Mh­langa, the camp ad­min­is­tra­tor, out­lined the myr­iad of chal­lenges that faces the refugee camp, but said they were not in­sur­mount­able, es­pe­cially with the help of the many or­gan­i­sa­tions that read­ily of­fer their sup­port, try­ing to make the lives of the refugees as bear­able as pos­si­ble. To this end, every month, the refugees re­ceive a cash stipend of $13 per head to meet in­ci­den­tal needs. Mr Balzer said the cash pay-outs go a long way in help­ing restor­ing dig­nity in the lives of refugees. “With this sup­port, WFP is able to pro­vide food as well as cash, al­low­ing you to do what fam­i­lies around the world do every day — de­cide to­gether as a fam­ily what goods to pur­chase and em­pow­er­ing the lo­cal econ­omy,” he said. Be­sides the cash hand-outs, the res­i­dents of the camp re­ceive a range of kind dona­tions, rang­ing from blan­kets, mos­quito nets, san­i­tary pads, to con­sum­ables like rice, cook­ing oil and cow peas. Mr Ning said the hand-over cer­e­mony re­minded him of a sim­i­lar event 20 years ago in China when a poverty-stricken vil­lage was re­ceiv­ing a school from a UN de­vel­op­ment agency. “Decades have passed and tremen­dous changes have taken place in China, the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has taken its peo­ple on a rapid de­vel­op­ment that leads to growth in all sec­tors of so­ci­ety and peo­ple’s liveli­hoods,” he re­marked. To this end, he said the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is ever-ready to as­sist Zim­babwe in re­al­is­ing some of its SDGs, es­pe­cially achiev­ing zero hunger. Ini­tially founded as a re­search sta­tion, the refugee camp has un­der­gone some in­ter­est­ing changes over the years. In 1979, when Rhode­sia signed the Lan­caster House agree­ment that ceased hos­til­i­ties with the lib­er­a­tion move­ments, the camp be­came a de­mo­bil­i­sa­tion cen­tre. Dur­ing this pe­riod when Vice Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wengwa was camp com­man­der, the re­search sta­tion was re­named Ton­gog­ara, in rev­er­ence of the army com­man­der who had just been killed in a road ac­ci­dent on the eve of the coun­try’s in­de­pen­dence. Soon af­ter the de­mo­bil­i­sa­tion, the camp closed. Then in 1984, as hos­til­i­ties between Re­n­amo and the Mozam­bi­can gov­ern­ment es­ca­lated, the camp re-opened to take in Mozam­bi­cans who were flee­ing the con­flict. In 1994, with the sign­ing of a peace ac­cord between the war­ring par­ties in Mozam­bique, the refugee camp was closed down as the refugees made their way back home. It was dur­ing this pe­riod that the refugee pop­u­la­tion at the camp peaked 50 000. To share the in­flux of Mozam­bi­can refugees dur­ing this time, Ton­gog­ara op­er­ated along­side Chambuta in Chiredzi, Nyan­gombe in Nyanga and Ma­zowe River Bridge. Af­ter the suc­cess­ful repa­tri­a­tion of Mozam­bi­can na­tion­als, the Ton­gog­ara Refugee Camp closed in 1995, and for the com­ing two years was used as a cen­tre for the dis­abled. Then in 1998, a civil war erupted in the Great Lakes re­gion and the camp opened again, now as a refugee re­treat cen­tre. The long­est-serv­ing res­i­dents at the camp to­day have been res­i­dent there since that 1998 con­flict. Ly­ing on some 870 hectares, the refugee camp en­gages the res­i­dents in self­help projects like soap-mak­ing, arts and crafts, pig­gery and ir­ri­gation schemes, so that their liveli­hoods are not en­tirely re­liant on donor-fund­ing. At the con­clu­sion of the long-day tour of the camp, Mr Ning pledged the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to help up­grade St Michael’s Sec­ondary School to Ad­vanced Level sta­tus. “I urge the camp ad­min­is­tra­tor, with the as­sis­tance of the de­vel­op­ment part­ners here, to make a pro­posal to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment through the rel­e­vant chan­nels and we are keen to as­sist with the up­grad­ing of this school. We have al­ready built a num­ber of schools around Zim­babwe and there is no rea­son why we should not build one with such a wor­thy cause,” he said. With an en­rol­ment of 705, the sec­ondary school has plans to take in A-Level stu­dents so that the refugees can con­tinue with their ed­u­ca­tion at the camp. The sec­ondary school feeds from Ton­gog­ara Pri­mary School, with a stag­ger­ing en­rol­ment of 1 900.",津巴布韦

De­vel­op­ment part­ners, donors and for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment ( FDI) should not be used as the pri­mary source to drive Zim­babwe to­wards Vi­sion 2030, but should be used to aug­ment or sup­port our home grown de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes. Only the peo­ple of Zim­babwe, not de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance, aid or free­bies, can spur our as­pired eco­nomic growth and so­cial trans­for­ma­tion tar­gets un­der Vi­sion 2030. We should set aside our petty dif­fer­ences, unite as a na­tion un­der a com­mon shared vi­sion, and be pre­pared to go into the trenches and sweat for the de­vel­op­ment of our great coun­try, for the ben­e­fit of cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. CBy now it should be clear that the “Zim­babwe we want”can­not be cre­ated by ex­tend­ing beg­ging bowls to multilateral de­vel­op­ment part­ners and donors. Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions, the World Bank ( WB) and In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund ( IMF) have of­ten come up with de­vel­op­ment as­sis­tance pack­ages that are not tai­lored to suit our de­vel­op­men­tal needs. WB and IMF pre­scribed the Eco­nomic Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­gramme ( ESAP) for Zim­babwe in the early 1990s and it cre­ated mam­moth eco­nomic prob­lems for the coun­try and in­flicted a lot of pain and suf­fer­ing on or­di­nary peo­ple. In fol­low­ing WB and IMF ad­vice, Zim­babwe be­came rapidly de-in­dus­tri­alised and un­em­ploy­ment grew apace, caus­ing un­told suf­fer­ing for or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans. This led to ESAP be­ing coined to mean“Eco­nomic Suf­fer­ing for African Peo­ple”. Not much de­vel­op­ment aid has been forth­com­ing from the IMF, de­spite nu­mer­ous team vis­its to Zim­babwe as part of the Staff Mon­i­tored Pro­gramme ( SMP), which is ba­si­cally an in­for­mal ar­range­ment be­tween Gov­ern­ment and IMF to mon­i­tor the im­ple­men­ta­tion of key eco­nomic pro­grammes in the coun­try. New con­di­tions are placed by IMF and WB mak­ing our ef­forts to chase af­ter for­eign de­vel­op­ment aid a wild goose chase. Western de­vel­op­ment part­ners have not made com­mit­ments to ex­tend new credit lines or of­fer debt re­lief thus keep­ing us in a per­pet­ual debt trap. De­vel­op­ment aid, as African his­tory shows, has not al­ways worked in our best in­ter­ests as most deals are tilted in favour of de­vel­op­ment part­ners or donors, re­in­forc­ing un­der­ly­ing un­equal or un­even power bal­ances be­tween de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. In­ter­na­tional (read Western) main­stream media cre­ates the im­pres­sion that Western coun­tries come to Africa with “bags of money” meant to save poor Africans by white phi­lan­thropists. Some (not all) hope­less non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions ( NGO), ma­jor play­ers in the de­vel­op­ment aid dis­course, do not have good in­ten­tions in Africa. Their aid comes with po­lit­i­cal mo­tives while win­dow dressed as de­vel­op­ment aid, when, in fact, the agenda is a con­tin­u­a­tion of im­pe­ri­al­ist po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vres meant to desta­bilise African coun­tries and per­pet­u­ate the colo­nial legacy of donor-re­cip­i­ent sub­servient sta­tus quo. If de­vel­op­ment aid is taken whole­sale, be­cause we are des­per­ate for fund­ing, our eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tions un­der Vi­sion 2030 may not be re­alised. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump of the United States of Amer­ica has con­tin­u­ously re­newed the Zim­babwe Democ­racy and Eco­nomic Re­cov­ery Act ( ZDERA) since tak­ing of­fice while the Euro­pean Union ( EU) on Fe­bru­ary 19 2019 ex­tended its sanc­tions on Zim­babwe. ZDERA de­nies Zim­babwe ac­cess to US mar­kets as well as ben­e­fits from AGOA (African Growth and Op­por­tu­nity Act of 2000), pro­mul­gated by the US Congress to pro­mote trade be­tween African coun­tries and the US. On the other hand, EU and US sanc­tions block Zim­babwe’s ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment fi­nance pro­vided by the IMF, WB or any other multilateral de­vel­op­ment in­sti­tu­tions such as Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment ( OECD), and De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Com­mit­tee ( DAC) coun­tries. Given the dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences of sanc­tions, we need to look in­wards and come up with in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions that dis­rupt the ef­fects of sanc­tions and al­low us to un­lock our po­ten­tial as a coun­try. There are so many things we can do within Zim­babwe. Hard work, in­no­va­tion, good eco­nomic poli­cies, fis­cal dis­ci­pline, fight­ing cor­rup­tion and loot­ing of pub­lic re­sources, pro­mot­ing a sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy driven ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem, and so on. Th­ese are some of the things we can do to drive eco­nomic growth, job cre­ation and poverty alle­vi­a­tion. Re­liance on for­eign aid, donors and multilateral de­vel­op­ment part­ners is not key to trans­form­ing Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic for­tunes. The coun­try has mas­sive hu­man cap­i­tal, fer­tile land and other nat­u­ral re­sources. We should use that as a foundation to spur growth and pros­per­ity. For­eign in­vestors should not be al­lowed to dic­tate terms to us. We have the re­sources that are in de­mand glob­ally and we should be smart, and call the shots.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200605,Pop­u­la­tion: Ex­plod­ing or shrink­ing?,"ONE of the sci­en­tific night­mares that haunt us is the so-called “Pop­u­la­tion Ex­plo­sion”. It is the fear that our planet is like an ocean-go­ing ship that floun­ders be­cause of over­load­ing. The ex­ces­sively grow­ing pop­u­la­tion will even­tu­ally make the ship cap­size and sink. And this growth is thought to be un­stop­pable. Peoples will grow, driven by their bi­ol­ogy, their hunger for man­power and the need for labour in a global econ­omy and their am­bi­tion for great­ness and su­pe­ri­or­ity over the na­tions with which they share this planet as ”their com­mon home”. Can this pop­u­la­tion growth go on for­ever? Can our in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion meant to sat­isfy the ever-grow­ing needs (for food, wa­ter, clean air, en­ergy, liv­ing space etc) go on in­creas­ing and cov­er­ing the land with garbage and waste while pol­lut­ing wa­ter and air, sea, rivers, lakes with plas­tic waste and the at­mos­phere with poi­sonous gases? De­mog­ra­phers pre­dict that the world pop­u­la­tion which was said to be “ex­plod­ing” will even­tu­ally be shown on graphs to tilt over and go into a de­cline and shrink. South Korea has al­ways ex­pected that the pop­u­la­tion as well as the in­dus­try pro­duc­ing for such an “ex­plod­ing” pop­u­la­tion will al­ways con­tinue grow­ing. But now the tran­si­tion from growth to shrink­age is within sight. In 2050 more than 40% of the pop­u­la­tion will be over 65 years of age. There will be a short­age for young peo­ple to work in in­dus­try whose pro­duc­tiv­ity will be needed to sup­port the old gen­er­a­tion in their re­tire­ment. This de­creas­ing work­ing pop­u­la­tion will trig­ger fierce com­pe­ti­tion be­tween in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries for the last re­serves of man­power on the globe. And the last young peo­ple still avail­able to fill the gaps on the labour mar­ket in the West and the in­dus­tri­alised East will come from Africa. La­gos in Nige­ria, soon to be the largest city of the world, will sup­ply the North with its own sur­plus of man­power. In pre-in­dus­trial so­ci­ety, long be­fore science de­vel­oped to­day’s tech­no­log­i­cal health­care, even large num­bers of chil­dren were wel­come. There was no pol­icy to re­strict fam­ily size which was left to na­ture. The high in­fant death rate brought about a high birth rate to re­place the chil­dren lost to child­hood dis­eases and epi­demics. De­mog­ra­phy be­gan to be a con­cern to sci­en­tists and po­lit­i­cal lead­ers when in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion caused ru­ral peo­ple to move to town, in search of work and a higher in­come. Thomas Robert Malthus (1766 – 1834) pub­lished his Prin­ci­ple of Pop­u­la­tion in 1798. Al­ways a pes­simist, he tried to con­vince his con­tem­po­raries that “pop­u­la­tion will al­ways tend to out­run the food sup­ply”. In our own age we are scep­ti­cal about Malthus’ prophe­cies. We are in fact pro­gress­ing in de­feat­ing poverty in some re­gions. Ad­mit­tedly, be­ing close to win­ning one par­tic­u­lar bat­tle does not mean we have won the global war. Zim­babwe, in par­tic­u­lar, which has re­cently had a deficit in food pro­duc­tion must be ashamed she now has to im­port grain. It is cru­cial that we re­gain our sta­tus as a pro­lific pro­ducer of food crops. Some States have tried to in­crease their pop­u­la­tions. Oth­ers are dras­ti­cally re­duc­ing their pop­u­la­tions. The best known ex­am­ple is the one-child pol­icy of China, now eased be­cause neg­a­tive ef­fects be­came vis­i­ble. In Zim­babwe, the twin sis­ter of Sally Mu­gabe, late wife of the first leader of Zim­babwe, prop­a­gated fam­ily plan­ning en­thu­si­as­ti­cally, even though some free­dom fight­ers be­lieved that pop­u­la­tion con­trol was merely a ruse by the im­pe­ri­al­ists to weaken the up-and­com­ing coun­tries of the south­ern hemi­sphere. Pop­u­la­tion plan­ners and de­mog­ra­phers ar­gue that we can only cope with “cli­mate change” if we do with­out chil­dren. Malthus makes a come­back with rad­i­cal and dras­tic pre­dic­tions. A strange logic (or lack thereof): if hu­man­ity wants to sur­vive (“cli­mate change”, for in­stance) it must ac­cept its slow death by do­ing with­out off­spring. How can that be? Surely, “cli­mate change” must be con­trolled pre­cisely be­cause we want to give chil­dren a chance to live. Even a fast de­vel­op­ing econ­omy may not be able to ac­com­mo­date all the young peo­ple on the labour mar­ket. Dras­tic mea­sures of pop­u­la­tion con­trol may also up­set the bal­ance be­tween gen­er­a­tions. The shrink­ing num­ber of young work­ers will not be able to pro­vide for the el­derly in their re­tire­ment. A one-child pol­icy may per­suade par­ents to have boys rather than girls, re­sult­ing in a short­age of women for young men to marry. In In­dia par­ents do not want daugh­ters who need dowries when they marry. So men may out­num­ber women. This is a blow to “gen­der equal­ity” and to women in gen­eral, re­sult­ing in lit­tle re­spect for women in so­ci­ety and es­pe­cially in a fam­ily cul­ture. Ma­nip­u­lat­ing the birth rate and the bal­ance be­tween male and fe­male can have very un­ex­pected ef­fects. In fact, the birth rate is not sta­ble. There are coun­tries that can­not cope with a high birth rate, and oth­ers are alarmed by a steeply de­clin­ing birth rate: births no longer re­plac­ing peo­ple dy­ing. The num­ber of work­ers goes down, there are no longer enough young pro­duc­tive peo­ple whose in­come keep pen­sion funds go­ing. So gov­ern­ments try to mo­ti­vate par­ents to have more chil­dren, en­cour­age larger fam­i­lies with sub­si­dies and “chil­dren’s bonuses”, en­abling women to have a fam­ily while pur­su­ing a pro­fes­sional ca­reer. Very high birth rates must not be brought down by reg­u­la­tion. A grow­ing pop­u­la­tion is not just a bur­den for a coun­try. Peo­ple are an as­set. We must value them for their tal­ents and gifts which they bring to us and for their dig­nity as unique per­sons. A cul­ture that hon­ours and re­spects fam­ily life has a fu­ture. If we dis­par­age fam­ily life to­day, we may re­gret it to­mor­row.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201119,Let’s not lower our guard against sec­ond Covid-19 wave,"“The global re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 pandemic will de­pend on the world com­ing to­gether in a col­lec­tive en­deav­our backed by sci­ence, fi­nance and po­lit­i­cal re­solve.” THE above quote from the African Devel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) pres­i­dent Ak­in­wumi Adesina during a virtual dis­cus­sion on the long-term so­cio-eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, is a pro­gres­sive ob­ser­va­tion on the role of African lead­ers in the fight against the virus. Sev­eral coun­tries are un­der siege from a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 fol­low­ing a spike in in­fec­tions in the last two weeks. Al­ready hos­pi­tals and morgues in Europe are filling up in an un­prece­dented and shock­ing man­ner. New lock­downs, night-time cur­fews, in­crease in mil­i­tary field hos­pi­tals and a litany of lock­down mea­sures are now the new face of Europe as lead­ers bat­tle to con­tain the surge in new in­fec­tions. Re­ports show that the United King­dom has be­come the first Euro­pean coun­try to pass 85 000 deaths from Covid-19, whose sec­ond leg is ex­pected to stretch to April next year. From the time the first Covid-19 case was re­ported in China last year, the pandemic has up­ended the world. It has left ev­ery­one scared and many be­reaved. It has dam­aged economies, weak­ened health sys­tems and scut­tled growth. It is be­cause of its con­se­quen­tial ef­fects that African na­tions need to do all they can to keep the virus at bay. Suf­fice to say, while Europe is al­ready numb with shock of the un­prece­dented rise in new in­fec­tions, Africa is tak­ing a lack­adaisi­cal ap­proach to­wards the virus and seems un­per­turbed by the im­mi­nent dan­ger that Covid-19 poses to the con­ti­nent. While there has been recorded five mil­lion deaths mainly in­Europe and Asia, Africa’s case has not been cat­a­strophic. That alone has in­vited com­pla­cency. With re­ported in­crease in new in­fec­tions, some ex­perts are re­main adamant that the spike in re­ported Covid-19 cases in African coun­tries a sec­ond wave, fol­low­ing lock­down re­lax­ations in South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, An­gola and Uganda. What is, how­ever, clear is that a sec­ond wave is im­mi­nent. Africa would need to strengthen its sys­tems against a sec­ond wave of Covid-19, which is set to hit the shores of the con­ti­nent, any­time. Vice Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga re­cently warned of a pos­si­ble sec­ond wave of Covid-19, saying ig­no­rance and de­nial could lead to more deaths. Ad­dress­ing a gath­er­ing in Bu­l­awayo last week, VP Chi­wenga who is also the Min­is­ter of Health and Child Care, ex­pressed con­cern over the in­creas­ing num­ber of peo­ple who were no longer ad­her­ing to preven­tion mea­sures at a time when the world was brac­ing for a sec­ond wave. Barely a week af­ter the Vice Pres­i­dent’s con­cern, 100 pupils from John Tal­lach Sec­ondary School in Bu­l­awayo have since tested pos­i­tive for Covid 19. The Gov­ern­ment has since or­dered the clo­sure of the school. The lat­est devel­op­ment merely points out the gravitas of Covid-19 and the need to ad­e­quately prepare for a sec­ond wave. With re­ported 8 897 pos­i­tive cases and 257 deaths since the first recorded case in March in the coun­try, the na­tion can­not af­ford to con­tinue to be com­pla­cent, but would need to up its game by ob­serv­ing the ex­ist­ing World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tions reg­u­la­tions. In­stead of tak­ing notes from coun­tries that are be­ing rav­aged, com­pla­cency is the big­gest win­ner in Zim­babwe as the mul­ti­tude have thrown cau­tion to the wind and are no longer ob­serv­ing lWHO guide­lines. Un­like the para­noia that gripped the na­tion in March, peo­ple have be­come com­fort­able and down­right ar­ro­gant. They are now in­ad­ver­tently eas­ing their pro­tec­tive mea­sures, low­er­ing their fa­cial masks, and have been lulled into a false sense of se­cu­rity, at a time the whole world is gripped with fear fol­low­ing an up­surge in new cases. In a bid to cir­cum­vent the Covid19 re­quire­ments while push­ing back progress, some cor­rupt el­e­ments in the health sec­tor are now pulling in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, tak­ing bribes for hand­ing out fake Covid-19 test cer­tifi­cates. Sadly, this syndicate is be­ing or­ches­trated by some health workers at ma­jor hos­pi­tals whose ma­jor clients are cross-bor­der traders, job-seek­ers and those des­per­ate for cheaper cer­tifi­cates. Be­yond the bor­ders, sim­i­lar shenani­gans are tak­ing place, as mul­ti­tudes of peo­ple be­come in­creas­ingly com­pla­cent. Other African coun­tries have also thrown down their gauntlets and eased lock­down re­stric­tions, ig­nor­ing the stark re­al­ity that Covid-19 presents in light of an­other wave that is al­ready rav­aging other coun­tries. Sev­eral lead­ers are not even ap­ply­ing their minds to the pre­dic­tion that Covid-19 is likely to hit Africa harder than Europe, North Amer­ica and other con­ti­nents due to weak health delivery sys­tems, poverty and the an­tic­i­pated vir­u­lence of the virus. The pandemic is not yet over and that alone re­quires African lead­ers to be vig­i­lant in their fight. While it cer­tainly true that Covid-19 has pre­sented a “new nor­mal”, where peo­ple will have to adapt to the ef­fects of the virus, it still re­mains a threat. Tak­ing a cue from Adesina, how we come out of this pandemic, and the speed of our col­lec­tive re­cov­ery, “will de­pend on our shared col­lec­tive global re­spon­si­bil­ity, to join hands to mo­bilise sci­en­tific and fi­nan­cial re­sources backed by strong po­lit­i­cal will”. Even in the face of hope, where Pfizer and BioNTech re­cently an­nounced that they had made progress on a vac­cine that is 95 per­cent ef­fec­tive, it is pru­dent for ev­ery­one out­side Gov­ern­ment to cap­i­talise on their shared val­ues and ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in the fight against the pandemic. ◆ chin­hemaruva@gmail.com",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170608,"China takes ini­tia­tive to ‘a new, just world eco­nomic or­der’","THE joint com­mu­niqué is­sued by world lead­ers af­ter the Belt and Road Fo­rum for In­ter­na­tional Co­op­er­a­tion (BRF) in Bei­jing mid-last month, con­tains the panacea to a just world eco­nomic or­der. The com­mu­niqué sum­maries the pro­ceed­ings and the out­come of the im­por­tant meet­ing that was at­tended by 29 Heads of State and Gov­ern­ment, as well as key lead­ers of in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions. The recog­ni­tion by the world lead­ers that the world econ­omy is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes which have pre­sented both op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges should be a wake-up call for a new eco­nomic or­der. It is time States pull in the same di­rec­tion when it comes to deal­ing with the eco­nomic is­sues that af­flict the world, and the BRF showed this can be achieved. The fo­rum’s recog­ni­tion for win­win eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion can pro­vide answers to some of the is­sues that the world is grap­pling with. It is time for mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion that ben­e­fits all, in­stead of the ex­ploita­tive re­la­tion­ship that has been cred­ited for some of the prob­lems, es­pe­cially those af­fect­ing smaller na­tions. In the com­mu­niqué, the world lead­ers made it clear that “this is an era of op­por­tu­nity, where coun­tries con­tinue to as­pire for peace, de­vel­op­ment and co­op­er­a­tion”. Ac­cord­ing to the com­mu­niqué, the lead­ers wel­comed “bi­lat­eral, tri­an­gu­lar, re­gional and mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion where coun­tries place em­pha­sis on erad­i­cat­ing poverty, cre­at­ing jobs, ad­dress­ing the con­se­quences of in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial crises, pro­mot­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, and ad­vanc­ing mar­ket-based in­dus­trial trans­for­ma­tion and eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion”. They recog­nised that the world faces chal­lenges. The growth of global trade and in­vest­ment re­mains tam­pered, and the rules-based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing regime is yet to be strength­ened, the world lead­ers noted. “All coun­tries, es­pe­cially de­vel­op­ing ones, still face com­mon chal­lenges of erad­i­cat­ing poverty, pro­mot­ing inclusive and sus­tained eco­nomic growth, and achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment,” the lead­ers said. It is im­por­tant that the lead­ers at the fo­rum placed the Silk Road Eco­nomic Belt and the 21st Cen­tury Mar­itime Silk Road (The Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive) at the cen­tre of cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties amid those chal­lenges. The ini­tia­tive, a brain­child of Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, is meant to en­hance con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween Asia and Europe, and other re­gions such as Africa and South Amer­ica. The ini­tia­tive seeks to pro­vide im­por­tant op­por­tu­ni­ties for coun­tries to deepen co­op­er­a­tion and it has achieved pos­i­tive out­comes since its launch in 2013. There is so much po­ten­tial to de­liver more ben­e­fits as the im­por­tant in­ter­na­tional ini­tia­tive takes shape and re­fo­cuses the world to­wards ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion. In their com­mu­niqué, the lead­ers at the fo­rum em­pha­sised the op­por­tu­ni­ties which can be created by com­mu­ni­ca­tion and co­or­di­na­tion among other global, re­gional and na­tional frame­works and ini­tia­tives for pro­mot­ing co­op­er­a­tion in con­nec­tiv­ity and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. This can be achieved through win-win co­op­er­a­tion among States and with de­vel­op­men­tal agen­cies. Tak­ing se­ri­ously in­ter-State and in­traS­tate ini­tia­tives can also re­sult in more co­op­er­a­tion that is ben­e­fi­cial to the ma­jor­ity, lead­ing to the re­duc­tion of poverty. The world lead­ers pledged to stand for en­hanc­ing in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion in­clud­ing the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive and var­i­ous de­vel­op­ment strate­gies, by build­ing closer col­lab­o­ra­tion part­ner­ships, which in­clude ad­vanc­ing North-South, South-South, and tri­an­gu­lar co­op­er­a­tion. The im­por­tance of ex­pand­ing eco­nomic growth, trade and in­vest­ment based on level-play­ing field, on mar­ket rules and on uni­ver­sally recog­nised in­ter­na­tional norms was noted. The fo­rum touched on im­por­tant is­sues like the pro­mo­tion of in­dus­trial co­op­er­a­tion, sci­en­tific and tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion, and re­gional eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and in­te­gra­tion to in­crease, in­ter alia, the in­te­gra­tion and par­tic­i­pa­tion of mi­cro, small and medium en­ter­prises in global value chains. The value that came out of the fo­rum as the strength­en­ing of phys­i­cal, in­sti­tu­tional and peo­ple-to-peo­ple con­nec­tiv­ity among all coun­tries. “We en­deav­our to ex­pand peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, pro­mote peace, jus­tice, so­cial co­he­sion, in­clu­sive­ness, democ­racy, good gov­er­nance, the rule of law, hu­man rights, gen­der equal­ity and women em­pow­er­ment; work to­gether to fight against cor­rup­tion and bribery in all their forms; to be more re­spon­sive to all the needs of those in vul­ner­a­ble sit­u­a­tions such as, chil­dren, per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties and older per­sons; and help im­prove global eco­nomic gov­er­nance, and en­sure equal ac­cess by all to de­vel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and ben­e­fits,” said the lead­ers. The lead­ers at the fo­rum made it clear they were de­ter­mined to pro­tect the planet from degra­da­tion, in­clud­ing through tak­ing ur­gent ac­tion on cli­mate change and en­cour­ag­ing all par­ties which have rat­i­fied it to fully im­ple­ment the Paris Agree­ment. With China at the fore­front in seek­ing a peace­ful world, the BRF agreed to up­hold the spirit of peace, co­op­er­a­tion, open­ness, trans­parency, in­clu­sive­ness, equal­ity, mu­tual learn­ing, mu­tual ben­e­fit and mu­tual re­spect by strength­en­ing co­op­er­a­tion on the ba­sis of ex­ten­sive con­sul­ta­tion and the rule of law, joint ef­forts, shared ben­e­fits and equal op­por­tu­ni­ties for all. This can only be achieved if there is mu­tual co­op­er­a­tion and equal treat­ment of na­tions. As a re­sult, the world lead­ers pledged to con­sult each other on an equal foot­ing and re­spect­ing the UN Char­ter and in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing sovereignty and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity of coun­tries. The prin­ci­ples of co­op­er­a­tion em­pha­sised the world lead­ers in­cluded (a) Mu­tual ben­e­fit: where coun­tries seek con­ver­gence of in­ter­ests and the broad­est com­mon ground for co­op­er­a­tion, tak­ing into ac­count the per­spec­tives of dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers. (b) Har­mony and in­clu­sive­ness: Ac­knowl­edg­ing the nat­u­ral and cul­tural diver­sity of the world and recog­nis­ing that all cul­tures and civil­i­sa­tions can con­trib­ute to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. (c) Mar­ket-based op­er­a­tion: Recog­nis­ing the role of the mar­ket and that of busi­ness as key play­ers, while en­sur­ing that the gov­ern­ment per­forms its proper role and high­light­ing the im­por­tance of open, trans­par­ent, and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory pro­cure­ment pro­ce­dures. (d) Bal­ance and sus­tain­abil­ity: Em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of eco­nomic, so­cial, fis­cal, fi­nan­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity of projects, and of pro­mot­ing high en­vi­ron­men­tal stan­dards, while strik­ing a good bal­ance among eco­nomic growth, so­cial progress and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion. Ac­cord­ing to the com­mu­nique, the world lead­ers also af­firmed the need to pri­ori­tise pol­icy con­sul­ta­tion, trade pro­mo­tion, in­fra­struc­ture con­nec­tiv­ity, fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion and peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes. Un­der this ini­tia­tive, the fo­rum agreed to pur­sue di­a­logue and con­sult in or­der to build syn­er­gies in de­vel­op­ment strate­gies among par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, not­ing the ef­forts to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in co­or­di­nat­ing de­vel­op­ment of the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive with other plans and ini­tia­tives to pro­mote part­ner­ships among Europe, Asia, South Amer­ica, Africa and other re­gions. In-depth con­sul­ta­tion on macroe­co­nomic is­sues by op­ti­mis­ing the ex­ist­ing mul­ti­lat­eral and bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion and di­a­logue mech­a­nisms was also seen as im­por­tant. The lead­ers also pledged to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion on in­no­va­tion, by sup­port­ing in­no­va­tion ac­tion plans for e-com­merce, dig­i­tal econ­omy, smart cities and science and tech­nol­ogy parks, and by en­cour­ag­ing greater ex­changes on in­no­va­tion and busi­ness start-up mod­els in the In­ter­net age in re­spect of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights. Pro­mot­ing of peace, mu­tu­ally-ben­e­fi­cial co­op­er­a­tion, and hon­our­ing the pur­poses and prin­ci­ples of the UN Char­ter and in­ter­na­tional law should be a shared re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. ◆ Feed­back: lchiko­vahh@ya­hoo. com",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170612,Cap­i­tal­ism holds back Africa’s eco­nomic progress,"IT is im­por­tant to note that only a hand­ful of coun­tries in this world have es­caped ab­ject poverty and at­tained high stan­dards of liv­ing through ser­vices and shop­ping malls alone. For the rest, it has been by churn­ing work­ers through fac­tory gates and into sweat­shops the Chi­nese, Tai­wanese, Sin­ga­porean and Brazil­ian way. Africa will be no ex­cep­tion and will have to go through sweat­shops and fac­to­ries to lift its over one bil­lion pop­u­la­tion out of poverty. Farm­ing, ser­vices and the ex­port of com­modi­ties are the main an­chors of Africa’s economies and this clearly ex­plains the stag­na­tion in eco­nomic progress. The chal­lenge the con­ti­nent will face is tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances which have ren­dered tra­di­tional in­dus­trial pat­terns im­po­tent. There are faster ro­bots do­ing work that tra­di­tion­ally re­quired hun­dreds of peo­ple and at a much faster speed. Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe and Zimbabwe are on the right path, fo­cus­ing and em­pha­sis­ing value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of the coun­try’s nat­u­ral and agri­cul­tural resources in­stead of ex­port­ing them in their raw forms. China has man­aged to lift a huge chunk of its over one bil­lion peo­ple out of poverty and at­tained its near-de­vel­oped sta­tus on the back of a strong value-added man­u­fac­tur­ing base, and in 2015, over 30 per­cent of China’s GDP share came from man­u­fac­tur­ing. This is where Africa still has a long way to go. A coun­try like Botswana is touted as an ex­am­ple of eco­nomic prow­ess in Africa yet it is just a back­yard stor­age for im­ports from all over the world. It is im­por­tant that Africa de­vel­ops a very strong value-added man­u­fac­tur­ing base. African coun­tries are lag­ging be­hind and this is ev­i­denced by a poorly share con­tri­bu­tion of man­u­fac­tur­ing to na­tional GDP fig­ures. South Africa’s is 13 per­cent com­pared to China’s 30 per­cent, Brazil 21 per­cent, Ire­land 37 per­cent, and In­dia 17 per­cent. Botswana’s man­u­fac­tur­ing share to na­tional GDP is a mere 6 per­cent, Sierra Leone 2 per­cent, Rwanda 5 per­cent, Tan­za­nia 6 per­cent, Namibia 10 per­cent, Nige­ria 9 per­cent and Zam­bia 8 per­cent. Zimbabwe has been un­der eco­nomic sanc­tions for over 15 years now and the con­tri­bu­tion of man­u­fac­tur­ing to GDP is 11 per­cent and ris­ing on the back em­pha­sis on value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. The above in­di­ca­tors point to an ur­gent need for Africa to fo­cus on value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of the con­ti­nent’s nat­u­ral resources. The com­bined GDP of the 54 coun­tries in Africa is around $1.5 tril­lion, less than that of Ger­many alone at $3.4 tril­lion which is well over dou­ble the com­bined African GDP. Africa has a pop­u­la­tion of 1.2 bil­lion peo­ple whilst Ger­many’s is 81.5 mil­lion peo­ple. So why is it that Africa, which is home to over 70 per­cent of the world’s most strate­gic min­er­als, can only have ac­cess to less than 2 per­cent of the world trade and only an in­signif­i­cant 1 of the world’s man­u­fac­tur­ing? It is easy to dis­miss th­ese shock­ing and de­press­ing sta­tis­tics and put it all down to cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment. Even with cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment, surely Africa should at least have made some strides in in­dus­trial development. The prob­lem is cap­i­tal­ism and the re­straints it has put on the con­ti­nent to ex­e­cute mean­ing­ful eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. This is a con­ti­nent that has been re­duced to a re­source ex­trac­tion Colos­seum and mere scrap­yard for cheap im­ports from those who do man­u­fac­ture and grow their economies. The whole con­ti­nent has been con­di­tioned to be pre­oc­cu­pied with the sim­plis­tic no­tion that the only rea­son for any lack of mean­ing­ful eco­nomic progress con­ti­nent-wide is cor­rup­tion and mis­man­age­ment. This is a con­ti­nent where aca­demics, PHD hold­ers and the many highly es­teemed, crack their heads, hold con­fer­ence after con­fer­ence, sym­po­siums and ar­gue amongst them­selves that Africa is fail­ing to progress be­cause of cor­rup­tion. Well, it’s not that sim­ple. Cap­i­tal­ism is and has al­ways been the great­est hur­dle to Africa’s rise eco­nom­i­cally. The con­ti­nent is stuck in an eco­nomic co­nun­drum. Here is a con­ti­nent that is pre­oc­cu­pied with “for­eign direct in­vest­ment” in­stead of look­ing in­ward, in­di­genis­ing and de­vel­op­ing its own value-added man­u­fac­tur­ing base. Every de­vel­oped coun­try has gone through the mire and mud of man­u­fac­tur­ing. The only real FDI that the African con­ti­nent is at­tract­ing at the mo­ment is glitz shop­ping malls, brand new mining trucks and noth­ing else and hence why the whole com­bined 54 African coun­tries have ac­cess to less than 1 per­cent of the world’s man­u­fac­tur­ing. This is un­for­tu­nate be­cause with the amount of nat­u­ral resources the con­ti­nent pos­sesses, its share of ac­cess to the world mar­ket should be larger. I have writ­ten and will con­tinue to write about pro­tec­tion­ism. Th­ese shock­ing sta­tis­tics clearly highlight the need for pro­tec­tion­ism, oth­er­wise the con­ti­nent will re­main the dump­ing ground for man­u­fac­tured wares from in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries. The sim­ple fact re­mains that there is no man­u­fac­tur­ing in Africa, and with­out man­u­fac­tur­ing, the con­ti­nent will not reach the sta­tus of be­ing in­dus­tri­alised or de­vel­oped and at­tain high stan­dards of liv­ing. Pro­tec­tion­ism is not new; it has helped all the de­vel­oped coun­tries to be where they are to­day. There are no short­cuts and there are no ex­cep­tions. All African aca­demics and learned gu­rus need to shelve their book­ish the­o­ries and re­alise that, for the con­ti­nent to thrive, there is an ur­gent need to re­fo­cus and strive for eco­nomic self-suf­fi­ciency, and force its way into the glob­alised pro­duc­tion value chain. Fancy shop­ping malls and truck­loads of ex­tracted min­er­als are not go­ing to trans­form Africa into an eco­nomic man­u­fac­tur­ing giant. Pro­tec­tion­ism will cush­ion Africa’s em­bry­onic in­dus­try from the cheap im­ports that have ren­dered the com­bined con­ti­nent’s en­tire economies highly un­com­pet­i­tive of the world stage. Africa has not failed be­cause of poor lead­er­ship, or cor­rup­tion; th­ese are mere symp­toms of the span­ners in the works that cap­i­tal­ism throws in the way of any mean­ing­ful eco­nomic progress for every African coun­try. For as long as I can re­mem­ber, the FDI hymn has been sung and echoed count­less times across Africa, but it seems no one is in­ter­ested in in­dus­tri­al­is­ing the con­ti­nent. Ev­ery­one is more in­ter­ested in un­hin­dered ex­trac­tion of the con­ti­nent’s abun­dant nat­u­ral resources. A glit­ter­ing and plush shop­ping mall in a poverty-stricken African coun­try with 100 per­cent of the shops owned by for­eign­ers and 95 per­cent of the prod­ucts, goods and ser­vices sold be­ing for­eign im­ports, is point­less and will only put Africa many years back­wards in terms of eco­nomic progress. So, in­stead of fo­cus­ing on the prob­lem at hand, what are the pro­posed so­lu­tions for the con­ti­nent? As high­lighted, the tra­di­tional man­u­fac­tur­ing model has been tam­pered with due to fast-paced in­no­va­tions and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances such as ro­bots, su­per-fast com­put­ers, mo­bile tech­nol­ogy and so on. The key is to in­vest in the new in­no­va­tions while at the same time pri­ori­tis­ing value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of Africa’s nat­u­ral resources in Africa. There is no point in im­proved tech­nolo­gies and in­no­va­tions only for the pur­poses of fa­cil­i­tat­ing the un­abated ex­trac­tion of the con­ti­nent’s nat­u­ral resources for value ad­di­tion else­where. The in­tro­duc­tion of tech­nolo­gies re­quires a strate­gic fo­cus on skills development and train­ing. In­vest­ment in new tech­nolo­gies with­out train­ing and skills development only cre­ates ghost fac­to­ries, ware­houses and towns. Ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and value-ad­di­tion re­quire spe­cific skills and sig­nif­i­cant amounts of cap­i­tal. So, this is an­other po­ten­tial stum­bling block and how can Africa find its way past this? The con­ti­nent is made up of 54 coun­tries and mul­ti­lat­eral joint work­ing and pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships will assist and see Africa take off eco­nom­i­cally. It is im­por­tant to em­pha­sise that th­ese pri­vate-pub­lic part­ner­ships be lo­cal. The con­ti­nent’s re­gions are sep­a­rated by in­ad­e­quately de­vel­oped in­fra­struc­ture and dis­sem­i­na­tion of train­ing and skills development will po­ten­tially be hin­dered. Em­pha­sis should be on mo­bile tech­nolo­gies to en­hance train­ing and skills development. The is­sue of dis­tance is ad­dressed and ar­eas where the train­ing in­fra­struc­ture is lim­ited will most likely ben­e­fit from vir­tual or mo­bile forms of train­ing. Africa will have to con­tinue with broad­based in­fra­struc­ture development projects such as im­proved road net­works and high­ways, power plants, mo­bile tech­nolo­gies, wa­ter development and in­no­va­tions in mining and agri­cul­ture. The is­sue of in­ca­pac­i­tated or non-ex­is­tent struc­tural eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture has been one of the big­gest hin­drance to African eco­nomic development. The need for power and lo­gis­ti­cal fa­cil­i­ties can never be un­der­stated for Africa to re­alise mean­ing­ful eco­nomic development and progress. The small and medium en­ter­prises are short-term so­lu­tions, how­ever for longterm and broad development sta­tus to be achieved, the con­ti­nent has to build on economies of scale for re­duc­tions in pro­duc­tion costs and in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity. This is crit­i­cal for eco­nomic development, de­vel­op­ing a strong man­u­fac­tur­ing base and en­hanc­ing the ex­port base. Africa has one ad­van­tage in that most raw ma­te­ri­als are on the con­ti­nent. The cost of trans­port of raw ma­te­ri­als are al­ready re­duced be­fore we even start. An­other crit­i­cal next step in Africa’s eco­nomic development and the development of a strong value-added man­u­fac­tur­ing base is col­lab­o­ra­tive work­ing amongst African coun­tries to cre­ate solid eco­nomic clus­ters. This is a con­ti­nent of over 1.2 bil­lion peo­ple, and ris­ing. All other coun­tries in the world are us­ing Africa as the dump­ing ground for their man­u­fac­tured wares. Africa, with a co­or­di­nated ap­proach, can har­ness this en­tire 1.2 bil­lion mar­ket and ex­pand. This is an ex­tra­or­di­nary con­ti­nent with resources, both ma­te­rial and hu­man. Do­mes­tic in­dus­trial clus­ters will pro­duce to cater for lo­cal de­mand and beyond. This is the essence of cre­at­ing long-term and sus­tain­able eco­nomic development. The con­ti­nent has no choice but to heed Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe’s pro­found words that for each and every African coun­try to re­alise true eco­nomic development, we have to put back the means of pro­duc­tion into our hands. We have to em­pha­sise ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and add value to our nat­u­ral resources in­stead of truck­loads of un­pro­cessed ma­te­ri­als ex­it­ing the con­ti­nent. For Africa to es­cape the claws of cap­i­tal­ism that con­tinue to choke it, the em­pha­sis should be on a value-added man­u­fac­tur­ing base. There are no short­cuts and only Africans will de­velop Africa. ◆ Ar­ti­cle first ap­peared on NewZim­babwe.com",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170811,What is China’s game in Africa?,"Not since the end of the colo­nial era has any one na­tion had such a wide as well as deep in­flu­ence on Africa as China. But what are the im­pli­ca­tions of such a pro­found change over so short a pe­riod for our con­ti­nent? In what way is this ‘in­va­sion’, as it is of­ten de­scribed by those crit­i­cal of China-Africa ex­pan­sion, dif­fer­ent from pre­vi­ous for­eign in­cur­sions? THE ques­tion posed in the head­line, “What is China’s Game in Africa?” has been ex­er­cis­ing an­a­lyt­i­cal minds in­side and out­side Africa for a con­sid­er­able time and al­though a whole slew of the­o­ries have been put for­ward, many of them have been proven to be flawed by the ac­tual re­al­ity. So we can only con­clude that we are still nowhere near to solv­ing the great “Chi­nese puz­zle”, if in fact it does ex­ist. Per­haps many of us, in­clud­ing think­tanks in­flu­enced by the West, which by and large view the Chi­nese pres­ence in Africa with undis­guised sus­pi­cion, have been ap­proach­ing the issue from the wrong per­spec­tive. Over the past five decades since the end of WW2, we have be­come used to look­ing at the world in terms of the strate­gies of su­per­pow­ers in their at­tempts to es­tab­lish hege­monies over var­i­ous parts of the globe. They have set about con­sol­i­dat­ing their “spheres of in­ter­est” us­ing both hard power - mil­i­tary force, eco­nomic sanc­tions and regime changes as well as soft power: diplo­macy, aid and cul­tural ex­ports such as films, mu­sic, lit­er­a­ture, art and value sys­tems. Africa, as in­deed most of the de­vel­op­ing world, has had lit­tle choice but to try and nav­i­gate through these of­ten dan­ger­ous shoals, tak­ing what­ever profit and gain that is avail­able and steer­ing clear of de­struc­tive con­fronta­tions as na­tions pur­sue their de­vel­op­ment agen­das. The pre­vi­ous five decades have there­fore been a fas­ci­nat­ing se­ries of mea­sure and counter-mea­sure as all the play­ers, ma­jor and mi­nor, en­gage in the mod­ern ver­sion of “The Great Game”, win­ning some hands and los­ing oth­ers. While the rules of the game of dom­i­nance re­main the same, strate­gies of­ten have to be re­drawn in the light of seis­mic events such as the col­lapse of the Soviet Union. Then, seem­ingly sud­denly and com­ing from an un­ex­pected quar­ter, en­tered the Dragon. In the case of Africa, the Chi­nese in­flux, un­like pre­vi­ous for­eign in­cur­sions, was not led by gun­boats or a heavy ide­o­log­i­cal bat­ter­ing ram. In­stead they po­litely knocked on the door and when leave to en­ter was given, they came in with smiles, firm hand­shakes and an over­flow­ing cor­nu­copia of goods and the means - fi­nan­cial as well as tech­ni­cal - to pro­vide Africa with what it needed most, a stream of in­fra­struc­ture. It was an of­fer that no one sen­si­ble could refuse. And the Chi­nese, un­like oth­ers, did not just make pledges, they de­liv­ered im­me­di­ately. To the as­ton­ish­ment of many, they did not in­sist on any con­di­tion­al­i­ties or seek to change the way coun­tries were gov­erned. “You are in­de­pen­dent, do what you have to do. Don’t in­ter­fere with our sys­tem and we’ll not in­ter­fere with yours,” was the mes­sage. But hav­ing been brought up in a world of vested in­ter­ests and covert mo­tives, we, and many oth­ers, kept ask­ing - but what is the real game? The West had made it clear that they re­garded Africa in terms of their own eco­nomic, strate­gic and ide­o­log­i­cal in­ter­ests and sup­ported or op­posed gov­ern­ments to the de­gree that African poli­cies and prac­tice con­formed to these sets of ex­pec­ta­tions. Surely, there­fore, the rea­son­ing went, there had to be a hid­den Chi­nese agenda. But what was it? Were they se­cretly push­ing com­mu­nism or es­tab­lish­ing cam­ou­flaged mil­i­tary spear­heads? No, they said. “We want re­sources to build our own econ­omy and you need plenty of cheap goods and lots of in­fra­struc­ture. We trade - you get what you want, we get what we want.” They termed it a “win-win sit­u­a­tion”. What you see is what you get? The more in­scrutable the Chi­nese re­mained, the greater was the spec­u­la­tion about their hid­den agenda. The­o­ries abounded - it was a “new form of colo­nial­ism” or a “mas­sive re­source grab”, or the Chi­nese even wanted to set­tle part of their large pop­u­la­tion in the wide open spa­ces of Africa, or ex­ploit its cheap labour; and so the ideas went on. But real ev­i­dence was thin on the ground. “We want a win-win sit­u­a­tion” was the dead­pan re­sponse. Per­haps they re­ally do mean what they say. Af­ter all, de­spite the fact that China is now the sec­ond-largest econ­omy in the world, it is still a de­vel­op­ing coun­try that has moved more of its cit­i­zens out of poverty more quickly than any other na­tion has ever done in his­tory and wants the same not only for Africa, but de­vel­op­ing Asia as well. China it­self still re­mem­bers what it was like to be a colony of for­eign pow­ers and no one can deny that it was a staunch sup­porter of Africa’s lib­er­a­tion strug­gle. It knows full well the cost of stick­ing to its own po­lit­i­cal sys­tem against that pre­scribed by other pow­ers and this is per­haps why it has de­cided not to in­ter­fere in any­body else’s af­fairs. “Only he who wears the shoe, know where it pinches”. In ad­di­tion, its eco­nomic logic is im­pec­ca­ble. Its spec­tac­u­lar rise has been built on mak­ing things and trad­ing them. It needs trad­ing part­ners and you can­not trade with a poor na­tion. So if you can help other na­tions to be­come more, pros­per­ous, you also be­come more pros­per­ous by trad­ing with them. So you set about mak­ing them more pros­per­ous by build­ing their in­fra­struc­ture and in­creas­ing your trade with them.It is an ar­gu­ment that is dif­fi­cult to fault even in these cyn­i­cal times. But China re­mains tight-lipped on many is­sues and there­fore the spec­u­la­tion on what ex­actly its game in Africa is will con­tinue. Time will tell. In the mean­time, let us take a fresh look at the ex­tent of China’s pres­ence in Africa to help us ar­rive at a more sober re­flec­tion on its mo­tives. For the past decade and a half, from the north­ern­most tip of Africa to the south­ern­most, from east to west, the only game in town has been China. From high-end shops in city cen­tres to ram­shackle stands deep in ru­ral Africa, the goods on sale are made in China. The num­ber of Chi­nese in Africa seems to mul­ti­ply by the week. Some are al­most in­vis­i­ble in their work camps; some pop up in all sorts of places - hawk­ing live chicken in a Zam­bian mar­ket; dig­ging for gold in Ghana or cop­per in DRC; ped­dling DVDs of Hollywood, Bol­ly­wood and even Nol­ly­wood new re­leases; run­ning huge Chi­nese-style restau­rants in the heart of Luanda; grow­ing, har­vest­ing and buy­ing mas­sive quan­ti­ties of tea in Zim­babwe; dig­ging ditches in Nige­ria; telling for­tunes in Tan­za­nia; and the list goes on and on. That is one pic­ture of the Chi­nese in Africa. The other is the mas­sive con­struc­tion and in­fra­struc­ture project sweeping right across the con­ti­nent - from new, state-of-the-art ports, to des­per­ately needed rail­way and metro sys­tems, to mod­ern high­ways cre­at­ing trans­port rib­bons all over the con­ti­nent, to bridges flung over rag­ing rivers, to mas­sive sky­scrapers al­ter­ing African cityscapes overnight, to hum­ming fac­to­ries, to gi­gan­tic power plants, to es­sen­tial telecoms and min­ing in­fra­struc­ture, to all-in­clu­sive hous­ing projects, etc, etc. A sweeping pres­ence from coast to coast",津巴布韦

The man of God said peo­ple were sick or suf­fer­ing from var­i­ous af­flic­tions be­cause they were bound by lim­it­ing demons as had been the case with Le­gion in the Bi­ble who was pos­sessed by demons and stayed at a grave­yard un­til he was de­liv­ered by Je­sus (Mark 5:2) “You should never find peace in the grave­yard. Greater Life is author­ity over wrong and sin­ful de­sires,” he said. Many could not en­gage in vi­able en­ter­prises to con­trib­ute to­wards na­tional de­vel­op­ment or en­joy life with their fam­i­lies be­cause they were ham­strung by evil spirits, he said. “Com­ing to God is the best thing that any crea­ture can do. You must then not be pun­ished or tor­tured (by demons) for that. When one comes to God good­ness and mercy has to fol­low them. When the word of God is spo­ken it comes fast and quick and when it hits you its im­pact is very pow­er­ful and very amaz­ing,” he said, as he ex­plained the de­liv­er­ance process. Queues formed ev­ery­day as peo­ple lined up to give tes­ti­monies of what God had done for them through Prophet Makandiwa. Both adults and chil­dren alike said they had been freed from evil forces and felt dif­fer­ently and more hope­ful about life.",津巴布韦

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150619,What we should see when we ‘Look East’,"NOT so long ago, China was held up as a prime ex­am­ple of ev­ery­thing that is wrong with doc­tri­nal com­mu­nism. Emerg­ing from a long and bru­tal civil war, al­most ev­ery­one in China ex­isted un­der con­di­tions of ab­ject poverty. Food was in short sup­ply and the lit­tle that was avail­able was strictly ra­tioned. The econ­omy was stag­nant, un­em­ploy­ment rife and the coun­try lagged far be­hind in tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment. Life was so bad that the av­er­age fam­ily only had one coat to share dur­ing win­ter; usu­ally worn by one who had ur­gent busi­ness out­doors. China was a coun­try that the West, in its col­lec­tive terror of com­mu­nism, pointed to as proof of the Or­wellian dystopia that re­sults from the Marx­ist-Lenin­ism ide­ol­ogy. That was then. To­day, China is ev­ery economist’s favourite ci­ta­tion case. With growth rates av­er­ag­ing 10% in the past 30 years, it is the fastest grow­ing ma­jor econ­omy, ris­ing to be the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy. With a nom­i­nal GDP of US$10,36 tril­lion in 2014, its in­fla­tion stood at 2% while its un­em­ploy­ment rate hov­ered around 4,1%. Cur­rently, China holds about US$1,224 tril­lion of the US trea­sury debt, which is a fifth of the en­tire Amer­i­can for­eign debt. For a coun­try that was once a bas­ket case, these are quite im­pres­sive sta­tis­tics. But how did China move from be­ing the dis­as­ter it was back then to the suc­cess story it is to­day? What ex­actly did it do to achieve this re­mark­able turn around? An­swers to these ques­tions are what Zim­babwe should be look­ing for as it looks East. As a coun­try, Zim­babwe has made a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion to align it­self with the Far East coun­try as part of its Look East pol­icy. This, re­sult­ing from the seem­ingly in­tractable stand–off it has with most of the coun­tries in the western hemi­sphere. There is no doubt that there is quite a lot to gain from study­ing what China has done well, par­tic­u­larly how it was done. The suc­cess of China did not hap­pen overnight. It took a lot of care­ful thought, good plan­ning and metic­u­lous ex­e­cu­tion over a long pe­riod of time. If Zim­bab­weans could take a mo­ment to pause, and dis­abuse them­selves of ide­o­log­i­cal rigid­ity as well as their fas­ci­na­tion with party pol­i­tics, they will no doubt reach con­sen­sus on the fact that there is much to gain in study­ing the Chi­nese model. Se­lected here­un­der are a few of their in­no­va­tive ap­proaches that are par­tic­u­larly strik­ing. When Deng Xiaop­ing be­came the leader of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist party in 1978, he im­me­di­ately launched the Four Mod­erni­sa­tions pro­gramme, mark­ing the com­mence­ment of the re­form era. Orig­i­nally set by Zhou En­lai in 1963, the Four Mod­erni­sa­tions pro­gramme was de­signed to re­ju­ve­nate the na­tional econ­omy through the strength­en­ing of four spe­cific ar­eas, namely, in­dus­try, science and tech­nol­ogy, agri­cul­ture and na­tional de­fence. First and fore­most, the Chi­nese im­ple­mented eco­nomic re­form be­fore po­lit­i­cal re­form. China’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem is strongly an­chored in the Maoist rev­o­lu­tion­ary cul­ture. By de­sign, it does not align it­self favourably with the western demo­cratic ideal of change through com­pet­i­tive elec­tions. Con­se­quently, a sud­den change to an elec­toral democ­racy would throw both its po­lit­i­cal and so­cial sys­tem into tur­moil. The Tianan­men Square protests of the late 1980s stand out as a poignant ex­am­ple. In the in­ter­est of pre­serv­ing peace, the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party elected to leave the one party state sys­tem in­tact with a pro­viso to grad­u­ally open the po­lit­i­cal space and al­low a peace­ful evo­lu­tion over time. In the mean­time, the party re­solved to deal with the econ­omy in­stead. Note the in­ge­nu­ity be­hind this de­ci­sion. Po­lit­i­cal ag­i­ta­tion oc­curs as a di­rect re­sult of lack. Be it lack of space, lack of a medium to ex­press one’s self or lack of op­por­tu­ni­ties to de­ter­mine one’s des­tiny; any one or a com­bi­na­tion of these will sooner or later pre­cip­i­tate dis­af­fec­tion. How­ever, the propen­sity for po­lit­i­cal ag­i­ta­tion loses cur­rency where there is eco­nomic well be­ing. When you give peo­ple an op­por­tu­nity to im­prove their lives, they will not camp in Tianan­men Square in a pro­longed hunger strike, taunt­ing the gov­ern­ment and then stand­ing in the way of Type 59 tanks when the gov­ern­ment re­acts. Se­condly, the gov­ern­ment made a se­ries of pol­icy de­ci­sions that were both prac­ti­cal and well thought out. When the Chi­nese come up with new poli­cies, they first con­duct multi-cen­tred tri­als to gauge their ef­fec­tive­ness. This in­volves the set­ting up of spe­cial eco­nomic zones where new poli­cies are de­ployed on trial. Care­ful mon­i­tor­ing would take place, iden­ti­fy­ing the suc­cesses and prob­lems that in­evitably arise. The poli­cies would then be re­viewed, re­fined and mon­i­tored once again. Once their ef­fec­tive­ness is proved, they would then be de­ployed coun­try­wide. This is a very sci­en­tific ap­proach in the prac­ti­cal­i­sa­tion of pol­icy de­ci­sions. Thirdly, the Chi­nese made a con­scious de­ci­sion to in­vest in in­fra­struc­ture and edu- cation. They went into Ja­pan and the coun­tries of the west and shopped for the latest tech­nol­ogy. Their aim was to up­grade their in­dus­try into first world stan­dards. To as­sist them in this re­gard, they roped in the UNDP whose en­try paved the way for mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions to come in with tech­ni­cal and fi­nan­cial sup­port. On the ed­u­ca­tion front, they sent their stu­dents to univer­si­ties all over the world and set up an over­seas on-the-job train­ing pro­gramme. They then de­lib­er­ately slanted their ter­tiary train­ing to­wards em­pow­er­ing stu­dents with en­tre­pre­neur­ial skills, en­cour­ag­ing a mind­set where the av­er­age Chi­nese grad­u­ate would rather start his own busi­ness than work for cor­po­ra­tions. They also en­cour­aged a skills up­grade pro­gramme for those that were al­ready in in­dus­try and com­merce, with the aim of im- prov­ing the qual­ity of its ser­vices and goods. This is an ap­proach which, in all like­li­hood, was bor­rowed from Sin­ga­pore. Sin­ga­pore has long had a rep­u­ta­tion of pro­duc­ing and ex­port­ing high-tech goods of ex­cep­tional qual­ity. This is a rep­u­ta­tion that they earned through the ex­e­cu­tion of care­fully crafted skills up­grade pro­grammes which made their goods and ser­vices at­trac­tive to the high-end user. Fourthly, they lib­er­alised the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, im­prov­ing the ease of do­ing busi­ness and mak­ing China an at­trac­tive and cost-ef­fec­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing lo­ca­tion. They used their labour, a re­source they had in abun­dance, to en­tice the multi­na­tion­als. With 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple, China’s pop­u­la­tion is the high­est in the world and labour is read­ily avail­able at rea­son­able rates. Soon, cor­po­ra­tions such as Ap­ple and Gen­eral Mo­tors were set­ting up shop in the Chi­nese main­land. For them, man­u­fac­tur­ing in China was a sen­si­ble busi­ness de­ci­sion; they could still ship their fin­ished goods to any­where in the world and re­alise a tidy profit. Fifthly, they in­sti­tuted a sus­tain­able and out­come based agrar­ian re­form pro- gramme. Sub­se­quent to the vic­tory of the Com­mu­nist Party of China in the in­ter­mit­tent Chi­nese civil war in 1950, land­lords, who had, hitherto, con­trolled vast tracts of pro­duc­tive land, had these lands taken away and re­dis­tributed to more than 300 mil­lion peasants. The gov­ern­ment fol­lowed the re­dis­tri­bu­tion with a se­ries of in­ter­ven­tion­ist poli­cies aimed at im­prov­ing pro­duc­tion. The gov­ern­ment or­gan­ised peasants into farm­ing teams. When this did not work, the teams were com­bined into what was called pro­ducer co-op­er­a­tives. When this also failed to yield the de­sired re­sults, gov­ern­ment es­tab­lished huge col­lec­tive farms and took di­rect con­trol of their oper­a­tions. Again, this failed to raise pro­duc­tion to de­sired lev­els. These start-stop gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tions, part of its Great Leap For­ward pro- gramme, cre­ated farm­ing in­ef­fi­cien­cies that con­trib­uted to the dev­as­tat­ing Great Chi­nese Famine of 1959-1961 pe­riod. More than 15 mil­lion peo­ple died dur­ing this famine and food sup­ply re­mained a prob­lem for years to come. As part of the Four Mod­erni­sa­tions pro­gramme launched in 1978, the Chi­nese in­cepted the House­hold (Fam­ily) Re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem. Un­der this sys­tem, the re­spon­si­bil­ity for agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion was re­turned back to in­di­vid­ual house­holds who were given manda­tory crop quo­tas that they had to meet. In re­turn for meet­ing these quo­tas, they were re­warded with seeds, tools, draft an­i­mals and other ne­ces­si­ties. What­ever food they grew over and above their quota, the farmer could sell in the free mar­ket at un­reg­u­lated prices. As pro­duc­tion in­creased, gov­ern­ment abol­ished manda­tory pro­cure­ment in favour of vol­un­tary con­tracts. This pro­gramme was so suc­cess­ful that by 1984, close to 99% of the pro­duc­tion teams in China had adopted it. In 2003, China pro­duced enough food to feed 20% of the world’s pop­u­la­tion us­ing only 7% of the world’s arable land. Not only did the House­hold Re­spon­si­bil­ity Sys­tem guar­an­tee na­tional food se­cu­rity, it raised the stan­dard of life for farm-based fam­i­lies. Lastly, the Chi­nese made a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion to stay out of for­eign wars. While it main­tains one of the world’s largest and most mod­ern army, China knows the eco­nomic ad­van­tage of not in­volv­ing it­self in con­flicts that are not di­rectly re­lated to its ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity. It does not need to act to prove its su­per­power sta­tus; its mere pres­ence is proof enough. What is self-ev­i­dent is that China has made all these gains through a lot of per­sonal sac­ri­fice, a se­ries of re­ally good poli­cies and a lot of hard work. As things stand now, it has met most of its Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals and, those that are still out­stand­ing, if any, it has placed within reach. Its main fo­cus now is to im­prove the qual­ity of life of its peo­ple and there is no doubt that this will be achieved in the not so dis­tant fu­ture. As Zim­babwe looks East, per­haps these are some of the is­sues that the coun­try should be study­ing with the in­ten­tion of adapt­ing them for its own turn­around. The im­me­di­ate les­son is a need to move away from im­prac­ti­cal goals and fo­cus on achiev­able ob­jec­tives. That Zim­babwe can at­tain the eco­nomic sta­tus that China cur­rently en­joys would be day­dream­ing, but there is noth­ing to stop the coun­try from dream­ing and try­ing to re­alise the dream.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150130,Gates leads donors in $7.5bn child vac­cines pledge,"In­ter­na­tional donors led by Bill Gates have pledged $7.5bn for vac­cines to im­mu­nise an ex­tra 300m chil­dren in poor coun­tries against deadly dis­eases at a sum­mit that saw China make its first mod­est step into the ranks of donor na­tions. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foun­da­tion com­mit­ted $1.5bn to the Global Al­liance for Vac­cines and Im­mu­ni­sa­tion (Gavi) over the next five years, un­der­scor­ing the Mi­crosoft founder’s role as one of the most im­por­tant sources of fi­nance for health­care projects in the de­vel­op­ing world. The UK, long the big­gest donor to Gavi, was the only coun­try to equal the Gates pledge, but the US com­mit­ted $1bn over a shorter pe­riod, four years. Mr. Gates said Gavi, which he helped found 15 years ago, was “the best in­vest­ment I ever made” be­cause of its suc­cess in im­mu­nis­ing 500m chil­dren against dis­eases rang­ing from measles to cer­vi­cal can­cer. “Gavi takes money and con­verts it into kids who grow up healthy,” he told a fi­nanc­ing sum­mit in Ber­lin. Nor­way was the next big­gest donor at $800m, fol­lowed by Ger­many, which dou­bled its pre­vi­ous com­mit­ment to €600m. The fundrais­ing drive was hosted by An­gela Merkel, Ger­man chan­cel­lor, as part of her coun­try’s pres­i­dency of the Group of Seven de­vel­oped na­tions. China pledged a sym­bolic $5m over the next five years, mark­ing the start of its tran­si­tion from a re­cip­i­ent of Gavi fund­ing into a donor. It was the last of the Brics coun­tries to make its first con­tri­bu­tion, fol­low­ing Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia and South Africa. The fundrais­ing was aimed at sav­ing at least 5m lives through the ex­pan­sion of im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­grammes over the next five years, with a fo­cus on vac­cines to tackle the two lead­ing causes of child­hood deaths: pneu­mo­nia and di­ar­rhoea. Seth Berkley, Gavi chief ex­ec­u­tive, had warned be­fore­hand that the $7.5bn fundrais­ing tar­get had been made harder to reach by re­cent strength­en­ing in the dollar - the cur­rency used to buy vac­cines - against the euro and other im­por­tant donor cur­ren­cies. Geneva-based Gavi has been widely hailed as a model for public-pri­vate part­ner­ship in global health pol­icy, bring­ing to­gether in­ter­na­tional donors, non­govern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions and vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers. It is ex­pected to play a lead­ing role in the sup­ply of Ebola vac­cines in west Africa should any of the three in clin­i­cal tri­als prove suc­cess­ful. Big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals groups sup­ply Gavi at a dis­count to de­vel­oped world pric­ing but the com­pa­nies have faced pres­sure from ac­tivists to go fur­ther. Pfizer on Mon­day an­nounced a 6 per cent re­duc­tion in the price of its pneu­mo­coc­cal vac­cine, which protects against bac­te­ria that can lead to pneu­mo­nia and menin­gi­tis. Médecins Sans Fron­tières, the health char­ity, dis­missed the cut as “mea­gre”. Glax­oSmithK­line pre­vi­ously ex­tended a price freeze on its vac­cines for Gavi. Michael El­liott, pres­i­dent of the One anti-poverty cam­paign, praised Ger­many’s lead­er­ship but said other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, next year’s G7 chair, could have done more.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151123,Fay Chung’s new map to the East,"Book: Zim­babwe Look­ing East Au­thor: Fay Chung Pub­lisher: Mlilo weFundo (2015) ISBN: 978-7974-6434-6 CLI­MATE of eco­nomic in­de­ter­mi­nacy out­lined Zim­babwe at the in­cep­tion of the unity gov­ern­ment in 2009. Coali­tion part­ners ide­o­log­i­cally os­cil­lated be­tween the polar ex­tremes of the mod­ern world - the East rep­re­sented by China, and the West rep­re­sented by Europe and the US. With Zanu-PF’s de­ci­sive elec­toral vic­tory in 2013, the Look East pol­icy was once again fore­grounded on the party’s roadmap to eco­nomic re­cov­ery. The pol­icy looks even more per­ti­nent at a time when China’s global as­cen­dancy con­curs with the marked de­cline of the post-2008 Western cap­i­tal­ist es­tab­lish­ment. How­ever, Zim­babwe’s for­mer Min- Ais­ter of State for Em­ploy­ment Cre­ation, Fay Chung, is wav­ing down a flag for the coun­try to pause and cal­cu­late what is there for it in the East. Chung, an ed­u­ca­tion­ist of Chi­nese de­scent, re­cently pub­lished a book called “Zim­babwe Look­ing East” to de­ter­mine the ef­fi­cacy of the pol­icy and to ex­plore fur­ther pos­si­bil­i­ties from the cur­rent ma­trix. To look or not to look is, how­ever, less than the ques­tion. Xin­hua news agency di­rec­tor Xu Lingui, who was a pan­el­list at the launch of Chung’s book in Harare last week, pointed out that it is pos­si­ble to miss it when the em­pha­sis is just on look­ing and not study­ing it crit­i­cally. “Zim­babwe Look­ing East” is not so much about how much Zim­babwe can ben­e­fit by rid­ing on the coat­tails of the Asian gi­ant but how it can ap­pro­pri­ate lessons from the rise of China for home­grown de­vel­op­ment. At the out­set of the book, Chung com­mends the Look East pol­icy as a po­lit­i­cally as­tute move by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe at the high tide of the an­tag­o­ni­sa­tion of Zim­babwe by the West over the land re­form pro­gramme. She, how­ever, main­tains that while it is pru­dent to look East, Zim­babwe must re­gard China not as a source but as a model for its own eco­nomic turn­around. Nei­ther East nor West but to in­ter­nal driv­ers is, ul­ti­mately, Chung’s loud and clear chal­lenge for Zim­babwe. “It is to­tally un­sound to ex­pect de­vel­op­ment to come from the East or from the West. De­vel­op­ment will come from in­ter­nal driv­ers,” she de­clares. At the mo­ment, Zim­babwe’s in­dus­tries are on a down­ward in­cline; nei­ther sus­tain­ing jobs nor com­pet­ing in­ter­na­tion­ally. The coun­try re­gressed from an in­dus­tri­al­is­ing econ­omy to be­come de­pen­dent on pri­mary pro­duc­tion, chiefly agri­cul­ture and min­eral re­sources, dur­ing the same time when China stepped ahead from be­hind. How­ever, hav­ing paid the painful cost of re­source na­tion­al­ism over the past 15 years, Zim­babwe can now utilise the recla­ma­tion of its im­mense nat­u­ral wealth for in­dus­trial ex­pan­sion. Chung sug­gests that this can be ac­com­plished in part­ner­ship with friendly coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly China, who should be able to cede tech­nol­ogy and ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­per­tise and fa­cil­i­tate mar­kets for Zim­bab­wean prod­ucts. The dif­fer­ence be­tween Zim­babwe’s re­la­tion­ship with the West and the East, is that the for­mer was more in­clined to aid, and is gen­er­ally scal­ing down, while the lat­ter in­sists on trade. The op­po­si­tion cam­paign mantra which has long re­volved around hold­ing the key to the donor chest is anachro­nis­tic and due for a re­al­ity check in this re­gard. To step out of the swad­dling bands of chronic de­pen­dency on aid, Zim­babwe needs to put its best foot for­ward, to de­mand tech­nol­ogy and ex­per­tise in re­turn for its re­sources. “Un­til and un­less Zim­babwe uses what lit­tle re­sources it has more ju­di­ciously for de­vel­op­men­tal pur­poses rather than for short-term po­lit­i­cal sup­port, it will fail to de­velop,” warns Chung. Chung dares Zim­babwe to dream wild and free as eco­nomic suc­cess in the Asian or­der is achiev­able but stresses long-term eco­nomic plan­ning as op­posed to pop­ulist tan­gents. No mean feat to dare this much, not­ing that China is poised to be the next if, not the now, global eco­nomic pow­er­house, while Zim­babwe has not been its best in re­cent years. How­ever, the fact that China man­aged to de­frock its sleep­ing gi­ant tag and stride to the eco­nomic fore­front, be­gin­ning around the same time Zim­babwe at­tained its In­de­pen­dence, demon­strates that a sim­i­lar changeover is at­tain­able here e vast pop­u­la­tion gap fac­tored, and a cus­tom scale an­tic­i­pated, Zim­babwe’s econ­omy will soar when it weans it­self of donor de­pen­dency and goes not just for the money but also for the tools. Chung ad­vo­cates this Asian model of de­vel­op­ment, whereby Zim­babwe can ben­e­fi­ci­ate its re­sources, max­imise pro­duc­tiv­ity and guar­an­tee its best in­ter­est at the in­ter­na­tional counter by trans­plant­ing mod­ern tech­nol­ogy and pro­duc­tion sys­tems from the East, and even the West. While China’s 1,3 bil­lion-strong pop­u­la­tion has been in­stru­men­tal in its eco­nomic ac­ces­sion, this needs not to be a shroud of im­pos­si­bil­ity as Zim­babwe looks East for a mir­a­cle model. It is per­ti­nent to ob­serve that Ja­pan and the Asian tigers, com­pris­ing Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Tai­wan, South Korea and Hong Kong, have also suc­cess­fully ex­e­cuted the Asian model. Chung, how­ever, notes that Zim­babwe, like many African coun­tries with small pop­u­la­tions, can­not sig­nif­i­cantly in­dus­tri­alise based on do­mes­tic needs alone. Rather, there must be prac­ti­cal em­pha­sis on re­gional syn­er­gies such as Sadc, which has a col­lec­tive pop­u­la­tion of over 200 mil­lion. En­hanc­ing trade within Sadc and the African Union is ap­par­ently ma­te­rial for ef­fort­less rhetoric at the mo­ment. How­ever, if pur­sued in earnest, it will not only shield African coun­tries who are get­ting less than their re­sources’ worth - 10 per­cent, in most cases - from ex­ploita­tion by for­mer colonis­ers, but also fa­cil­i­tate in­no­va­tion, pro­vide var­ied so­lu­tions and grow one of the world’s most strate­gic mar­ket­places. Chung makes a com­par­a­tive anal­y­sis of the Western and East­ern de­vel­op­ment mod­els and em­pha­sises that Zim­babwe’s pe­cu­liar re­al­i­ties rule out an in­dis­crim­i­nate trans­plant of ei­ther model. Rather, the coun­try can ap­pro­pri­ate the best of both worlds, with par­tic­u­lar em­pha­sis on the more prag­matic and hu­man-cen­tred ten­den­cies. The West’s neo-lib­eral pre­scrip­tions failed Zim­babwe in the 1990s when Zim­babwe pur­sued struc­tural ad­just­ment be­gin­ning 1990. Of­fi­cial re­nun­ci­a­tion of this path in 1996 did not sig­nif­i­cantly re­verse the huge class dis­par­i­ties which had set in, with min­is­ters ser­vic­ing the dis­en­fran­chised elec­torate with rev­o­lu­tion­ary ear candy, while a num­ber of them have been bent to self-en­rich­ment ever since. Such de­cep­tion has a par­al­lel in the US, where elec­tions are bankrolled by cap­i­tal­ist in­ter­ests and the masses hood­winked by cam­paigns which are just su­per­fi­cial fronts for a money-minded mi­nor­ity. The few pos­i­tive lessons from the US in­clude its com­mit­ment to main­tain­ing a high stan­dard of liv­ing for its cit­i­zens and its en­abling cli­mate for world-class in­no­va­tion. China also pro­vides a mas­ter­class in in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship. Chung ob­serves that China’s ex­port-ori­ented out­look makes it pos­si­ble for gov­ern­ment and es­tab­lished busi­nesses to pro­vide in­fras­truc­tural, tech­no­log­i­cal and man­age­rial sup­port for promis­ing start-ups. This would be ideal for Zim­babwe where a highly ed­u­cated young pop­u­la­tion, cur­rently strug­gling to be ac­com­mo­dated by the for­mal sec­tor, can be en­cour­aged to go the start-up route and to grow jobs in­stead of wait­ing on the lim­ited space for mir­a­cles. China also pro­vides a per­ti­nent les­son in that it un­equiv­o­cally outlaws cor­rup­tion as eco­nomic sab­o­tage whereas Zim­babwe en­ter­tains many posh eu­phemisms for this basest of vices. Cor­rup­tion, let it be said, has as­sumed a de­fault Zim­bab­wean cit­i­zen­ship with money-hun­gry lead­ers among the pri­mary ben­e­fi­cia­ries. Lack of will to fight cor­rup­tion is Zim­babwe’s great­est un­do­ing, an un­ac­cept­able rip-off by a po­lit­i­cal elite which has the au­dac­ity to eat into our gen­er­a­tion in­stead of work­ing for sus­tain­able eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. China pro­vides a refreshing con­trast in this re­gard with a merit-based and highly dis­ci­plined lead­er­ship and work­force which places due pre­mium on na­tional in­ter­est. An­other im­por­tant les­son from China is gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to fund­ing re­search and close part­ner­ship with in­tel­lec­tu­als for the coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment. China has also been able to get the ma­jor­ity of its cit­i­zens out of poverty and sus­tains ef­fort to bridge the ur­ban-ru­ral gap. The neg­a­tive lessons from China in­clude its one-party sys­tem, ex­ploita­tion of its vast pop­u­la­tion as a cheap source of labour for for­eign cap­i­tal­ists, and largely unchecked in­dus­trial pres­sure on the en­vi­ron­ment. Chung will have to cor­rect mi­nor fac­tual er­rors in sub­se­quent edi­tions of her book. In one in­stance, she er­ro­neously says that Theodore Roo­sevelt served two US pres­i­den­tial terms from 1933 to 1941. As a mat­ter of fact, Franklin D. Roo­sevelt, who died dur­ing his fourth term, served from 1933 to 1945. Theodore, an ear­lier pres­i­dent, was in of­fice from 1901 to 1909. “Zim­babwe Look­ing East” is, on the whole, one of the most im­por­tant books pub­lished this year. The in­tel­li­gent com­men­tary is a wel­come de­par­ture from the shrill per­son­al­ity pol­i­tics we are in­un­dated with from ev­ery side.

How­ever, the $3,456,789 is not go­ing to line the pock­ets of the Berk­shire Hath­away chief, who is the world’s third-rich­est per­son with a $66bn for­tune, ac­cord­ing to Forbes. Rather, it will help a San Fran- cisco home­less char­ity called Glide.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180410,The ethics of re­duc­ing in­equal­ity,"Hughes’s pro­posal for a min­i­mum guar­an­teed in­come is a step in the right di­rec­tion, but it would be a mis­take to view it as the panacea. EVEN in older democ­ra­cies such as the United States, eco­nomic marginal­i­sa­tion has led to a strength­en­ing of chau­vin­ist and su­prem­a­cist iden­ti­ties and other so­cial prob­lems such as the opi­oid epi­demic. These trends have been on­go­ing for some time. But, ac­cord­ing to Branko Mi­lanovic of the City Univer­sity of New York, a big shift oc­curred be­tween 1988 and 2008. Dur­ing this pe­riod of “high glob­al­i­sa­tion”, the two seg­ments of the world mak­ing gains were the wealth­i­est one per­cent in rich and poor coun­tries and the mid­dle class in a few Asian coun­tries — namely China, In­dia, In­done­sia, Thai­land, and Viet­nam. Mean­while, the World Bank has shown that 766 mil­lion peo­ple — around 10 per­cent of the global pop­u­la­tion — were still liv­ing be­low the ex­treme-poverty thresh­old of $1,90 per day as of 2013. Much has been writ­ten about the poli­cies needed to rec­tify this dis­mal pic­ture. And yet, pow­er­ful voices in both rich and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries — and, trag­i­cally, even among the mis­in­formed poor — claim that cur­rent in­come dis­par­i­ties are fair be­cause they are a re­sult of free mar­kets. Con­vinc­ing them to sup­port re­me­dial in­ter­ven­tions, then, will re­quire a deeper look at the un­der­ly­ing logic and moral­ity of in­equal­ity. I was think­ing about this as I read Chris Hughes’ mar­vel­lous book, “Fair Shot: Re­think­ing In­equal­ity and How We Earn”. Hughes co-founded Face­book with Mark Zucker­berg and is now stag­ger­ingly wealthy at the ripe age of 34. His book gives a mov­ing ac­count of grow­ing up in small town North Carolina, try­ing awk­wardly to fit in with the “white, wealthy kids,” even­tu­ally com­ing out as gay, and do­ing well enough in school to gain ad­mis­sion to Har­vard Univer­sity. Hughes ended up room­ing with Zucker­berg, which was sheer luck. In­deed, a large part of his book deals with the role of luck in de­ter­min­ing in­di­vid­ual suc­cess. Though Hughes’s fa­ther taught him that re­al­is­ing the “Amer­i­can dream” is a mat­ter of pulling one­self up by one’s boot­straps, Hughes even­tu­ally reached the op­po­site con­clu­sion. “My suc­cess at Face­book,” he writes, “taught me that seem­ingly small events like who you choose to room with in col­lege can have an out­sized im­pact on the rest of your life.” Hughes’s so­lu­tion to the prob­lem of in­equal­ity is to tax the rich in or­der to pro­vide a guar­an­teed min­i­mum in­come to the lower and mid­dle classes. It is heart­en­ing that at least some of Amer­ica’s wealth­i­est in­di­vid­u­als are hon­est enough to recog­nise the un­fair­ness of the sys­tem, even though they have done well by it. To un­der­stand the logic and moral­ity of in­equal­ity, it is worth dig­ging fur­ther into what Hughes says about luck. It is not just that one part of his wealth is due to luck; rather, all of it is. Luck de­ter­mined that Hughes would be smart enough to get into Har­vard and then meet Zucker­berg once there. Like­wise, it was luck that Zucker­berg had learned Atari BA­SIC pro­gram­ming from his fa­ther when he was a child. Some try to counter this by point­ing out that hard work also mat­ters. But that is be­side the point. Af­ter all, whether or not one has a strong work ethic is it­self due to luck, be­cause it de­pends on one’s ge­netic make-up, en­vi­ron­ment, and up­bring­ing. Thus, the pri­macy of luck as a de­ter­mi­nant of wealth means that there is no moral jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for eco­nomic in­equal­ity. At this point, many well-in­ten­tioned rad­i­cals will con­clude that we must there­fore have to­tal equal­ity. But the “there­fore” is in­valid. En­sur­ing fair­ness and eq­uity are im­por­tant, to be sure, but so is erad­i­cat­ing poverty and im­prov­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for the mid­dle class. Un­der cur­rent con­di­tions, push­ing for ab­so­lute equal­ity could erode the in­cen­tive to work, lead­ing to wide­spread eco­nomic break­down. We have al­ready seen this hap­pen with many well-mean­ing so­cial ex­per­i­ments in the past. We will have to strike a bal­ance. To­day’s un­ac­cept­ably high in­equal­ity de­mands in­ter­ven­tions to im­prove ed­u­ca­tion and health, as well as re­dis­tribu­tive tax­a­tion of the kind that Hughes rec­om­mends; but it also re­quires us to tol­er­ate some in­come dis­par­i­ties to keep peo­ple and economies work­ing. Hughes’s pro­posal for a min­i­mum guar­an­teed in­come is a step in the right di­rec­tion, but it would be a mis­take to view it as the panacea.

The wealth of this coun­try must be shared... That will hap­pen whether some peo­ple like it or not.” Ramaphosa was wel­comed with cheer and danc­ing by African Na­tional Congress branch mem­bers in the re­gion. ANC mem­bers sang that change was coming fol­lowed by: “We dont want Zuma, we want Cyril.” The song was also sung dur­ing what ap­peared to be the launch of Ramaphosa’s cam­paign in Uiten­hage dur­ing the Chris Hani memorial lecture. Ramaphosa cau­tioned mem­bers against cer­tain “in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies” who were now “preach­ing” rad­i­cal eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion to ben­e­fit them­selves. “...

We can’t choose a few peo­ple. We are go­ing to thor­oughly em­power our peo­ple... so that they live bet­ter lives.” He said he be­lieved that the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Plan’s vi­sion to re­duce un­em­ploy­ment by 6 per­cent in 2030 was pos­si­ble if cer­tain in­di­vid­u­als stop steal­ing from the state.

A 56-year-old artist, Richard Mupumha, who has been in the in­dus­try for 35 years, opened up to The Sun­day Mail So­ci­ety. “Our lo­cal mar­ket is yet to ac­cept this form of art. Most of the peo­ple who buy our prod­ucts are tourists and a few blacks who are into the buy­ing and sell­ing of our prod­ucts across bor­ders,” he said. Source of in­spi­ra­tion Chi­tung­wiza Arts Cen­tre chair­per­son God­win Madzinga reck­ons the iconic Ten­genenge Arts Vil­lage in Guruve nur­tured and in­spired their op­er­a­tions. “Ten­genenge has pro­duced fine artistes over the years. Our first gen­er­a­tion artistes here (Chi­tung­wiza Arts Cen­tre) like Sylvester Mubayi came from the vil­lage and they have passed their knowl­edge to a lot of aspir­ing sculp­tors who are now brands in their own right,” re­vealed Madzinga. Vi­a­bil­ity of trade How­ever, Madzinga in­di­cated that busi­ness was presently sub­dued. “The mar­ket is on the low side these days and the guys are go­ing for three to four months with­out reg­is­ter­ing a sin­gle sale. Prob­a­bly it is be­cause tourists are no longer vis­it­ing this side as much as they did in the past. It could also be due to the fact that the ma­jor­ity of lo­cals do not see the im­por­tance of sculp­tures in pre­serv­ing, pro­mot­ing and telling the Zim­bab­wean story,” he said. Nev­er­the­less, Madzinga notes the cen­tre re­mains a vi­tal source of liveli­hood for many artists. “Some of the artists from our hub have had the op­por­tu­nity to ex­hibit in Europe, Canada, Ger­many, United King­dom, United States of Amer­ica, South Korea, China etcetera in cul­tural ex­change pro­grammes. The vis­its have opened new win­dows and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties for them.” Art fo­cus and sig­nif­i­cance Tago Tazvitya opines their work is an in­te­gral part of our cul­ture. “Most of our prod­ucts talk about ex­pe­ri­ences, old and new cul­ture in Zimbabwe. In short, we talk about cul­ture, our tra­di­tion through stones,” he said. Chi­tung­wiza Arts Cen­tre was es­tab­lished in 1997 by the then Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion, Sports and Cul­ture. The project was funded by the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP) un­der its poverty al­le­vi­a­tion plan. Chi­tung­wiza Mu­nic­i­pal­ity do­nated land. The cen­tre is one of the few suc­cess­ful com­mu­nity-based projects in ur­ban cen­tres. Most of its mem­bers are past win­ners of the pres­ti­gious Na­tional Arts Merit Awards (Nama) gong. The cen­tre was es­tab­lished in or­der to of­fer in­no­va­tive and qual­ity arts prod­ucts which meet in­ter­na­tional stan­dards. It was also meant to con­trib­ute to the coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.",津巴布韦

Ev­ery Zim­bab­wean is duty-bound to play their part. The con­duct of the July 30 elec­tions, through which Zim­bab­weans con­ducted them­selves in an ad­mirably peace­ful and or­derly man­ner, clearly in­di­cate an in­her­ent co­he­sive­ness that can be tapped as so­cial cap­i­tal to spear­head na­tional devel­op­ment. Quite clearly, Zim­bab­weans have the abil­ity to chart their own way for­ward.

Now the real work of crys­tallis­ing elec­tion prom­ises into tan­gi­ble poli­cies be­gins. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s lead­er­ship, how­ever, in­fec­tiously in­spires con­fi­dence. He is re­puted as an ef­fi­cient, hard­worker and a doer. Most of his prom­ises come to pass. But he can­not do it alone. The coun­try has to rise above parochial and su­per­fi­cial po­lit­i­cal dif­fer­ences and forge a united front to deal with the chal­lenges that cur­rently con­front Zim­babwe. The cur­rent nega­tive en­ergy, es­pe­cially on so­cial me­dia, doesn’t not help rally the coun­try’s cause. The new po­lit­i­cal ad­min­is­tra­tion has been preach­ing about the virtues of the dig­nity of hard work, which nec­es­sar­ily im­plies that there is need for a shift in mind-set and a re­set in the way we do things. Cling­ing to the old habits of bu­reau­cratic sloth, in­ef­fi­cien­cies and short­cuts will take us nowhere. It is only a sure path to mu­tu­ally as­sured de­struc­tion. Over the ages, so­cial­ist po­lit­i­cal doc­trines have emerged out of the re­al­i­sa­tion that self-in­dul­gen­cies can­not work for the com­mon good of both com­mu­ni­ties and so­ci­eties. A “col­lec­tivi­sa­tion” of goals and as­pi­ra­tions can, there­fore, lead to mu­tu­ally as­sured devel­op­ment. There is no room for slack­en­ing if the Sec­ond Repub­lic is to achieve Vi­sion 2030. Leapfrog­ging other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, some of which do not have the in­con­ve­niences of deal­ing with sanc­tions or ill-will from hos­tile coun­tries, is not easy. How­ever, the sig­nal com­ing from Gov­ern­ment through the ap­point­ment of a re­fresh­ing Cabi­net and a planned shake up of the bu­reau­cracy, is quite heart­en­ing. In­com­pe­tent bu­reau­crats should be shown the door. Fur­ther, Gov­ern­ment sys­tems need to be strength­ened so that they be­come re­spon­sive to the needs of Zim­bab­weans and in­vestors. Equally, there is need to make sure that youths, who con­sti­tute the bulk of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion, ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in the econ­omy. An en­vi­ron­ment that pro­motes en­trepreneur­ship and in­no­va­tion should be cre­ated to ac­com­mo­date them. The chal­lenge is not only to re­open closed in­dus­tries, but to cre­ate new ones as the Fourth In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion dic­tates. Our youths, there­fore, should be more than pre­pared to take up the role of pi­o­neer­ing new en­tre­pre­neur­ial fron­tiers. The Di­as­pora also have a key role to play as they have been ex­posed to tech­nolo­gies and sys­tems, some of which can work in our cir­cum­stances. The in­tel­li­gence and knowhow can be an in­valu­able com­po­nent of our as­pi­ra­tions as a na­tion. It is a ma­jor in­gre­di­ent if the coun­try is to rapidly de­velop. Also, in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to cir­cum­vent the pre­sent sanc­tions plagu­ing the coun­try. In an en­vi­ron­ment where there are dif­fi­cul­ties in ac­cess­ing devel­op­ment fi­nance from in­ter­na­tional fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions, for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment can prove quite handy. All that is needed is to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment where cap­i­tal feels com­fort­able. What is of­ten lost to many is the fact that it is not for­eign in­vestors only that have to play a role to de­velop Zim­babwe, but lo­cal in­vestors are cru­cial to in giv­ing an in­di­ca­tion that the en­vi­ron­ment is now ac­com­moda­tive to whoso­ever wants to start a busi­ness. So, our laws must also have this spe­cial group in mind. The abil­ity of emerg­ing economies such as China and Rus­sia to con­tinue grow­ing at bet­ter-than-ex­pected rates, even though fac­ing head­winds from puni­tive tar­iffs and sanc­tions, is in­struc­tive of how an ef­fi­cient sys­tem can spur eco­nomic growth. The World Bank in 2013 de­clared Rus­sia a high-in­come coun­try and presently it is con­sid­ered the sixth-largest econ­omy in the world by pur­chas­ing power par­ity. China con­tin­ues on a growth tra­jec­tory and is now com­pet­ing with the United States to be­come the world’s big­gest econ­omy. A June 2017 re­port by McKin­sey ti­tled “Dance of the Lions and Dragons” in­di­cated that China was now Africa’s big­gest eco­nomic part­ner. The vol­ume of trade be­tween Africa and China trade rose from $13 bil­lion in 2001 to $188 bil­lion in 2015. Suf­fice to say, the world is now full of po­ten­tial trad­ing part­ners. As Deng Xiaop­ing, the fa­ther of China’s eco­nomic mir­a­cle, once said, it doesn’t mat­ter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice. We have to keep our op­tions open. The ma­jor thrust of the new Gov­ern­ment should be in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and in­dus­trial devel­op­ment. Com­pa­nies need to be mod­ernised and re­tooled to cre­ate com­pet­i­tive­ness and ef­fi­cien­cies. It sim­ply means pro­duc­tion pro­cesses should be mech­a­nised and new pro­duc­tion meth­ods in­tro­duced. Al­ready, Gov­ern­ment has in­di­cated that the coun­try’s eco­nomic growth will be pred­i­cated on agri­cul­ture and min­ing. Com­mand Agri­cul­ture has put the coun­try on the path of food self-suf­fi­ciency, in­creased ru­ral in­comes and bet­ter liv­ing stan­dards. Agri­cul­ture’s in­flu­ence, as a sec­tor which sup­plies 60 per­cent of raw ma­te­ri­als to in­dus­try and em­ploys more than 70 per­cent, is per­va­sive. It means there is need for more agro-tech­nol­ogy and agro-pro­cess­ing. Put sim­ply, food se­cu­rity guar­an­tees devel­op­ment. The ball is now squarely in our court as Zim­bab­weans to en­sure that we en­hance the agri­cul­tural value chain. How­ever small the part we play, we should all con­trib­ute to the devel­op­ment of our coun­try. We ei­ther sink or swim to­gether.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180919,De­mys­ti­fy­ing eco­nomic de­vo­lu­tion - from ‘Look­ing East’ to ‘Be­ing East’,"FROM the day he be­came Pres­i­dent, tak­ing over from Mr Robert Mugabe, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s eco­nomic doc­trine has largely hinged on the Chi­nese model. Un­der Deng Xiaop­ing, China rose from the abyss of poverty to the global sum­mit. This feat is at­trib­ut­able to rad­i­cal eco­nomic poli­cies pur­sued and adopted by the Asian coun­try, in­clud­ing open­ing up to in­vest­ment. To­day the Chi­nese econ­omy is the sec­ond largest glob­ally. Bei­jing’s jour­ney to the top nat­u­rally is a vi­tal eco­nomic Bi­ble for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries like Zim­babwe as­pir­ing for the same. Why rein­vent the wheel? The ob­vi­ous ad­van­tage of pur­su­ing a path long walked by oth­ers is the abil­ity to avoid pit­falls they suf­fered along the way and mak­ing ad­just­ments where fit. Never mind the anti-Sino-Africa re­la­tions sen­ti­ments em­a­nat­ing from Western cap­i­tals. The West has tried to cre­ate a no­tion that China, which has not colonised any­one in its history, is colonis­ing Africa through se­duc­tive loans fully cog­nisant of the lack of ca­pac­ity to re­pay by ben­e­fi­cia­ries. Pro­po­nents of such dis­course al­lege China grabs African as­sets to re­coup its loans once a ben­e­fi­ciary has de­faulted. The panic in the Western world over the African-Chi­nese in­ter­course sug­gests one thing - a re­al­i­sa­tion by the same that it blun­dered in fail­ing to knit its re­la­tions with Africa on a win-win ba­sis. The con­se­quences of the “big brother” men­tal­ity have since turned into an eco­nomic cost. The Chi­nese are mak­ing in­deli­ble eco­nomic foot­prints in Africa - not only from an eco­nomic per­spec­tive, but also from a gov­er­nance view­point as well with coun­tries like Zim­babwe now struc­tur­ing their economies af­ter the Chi­nese model. De­vo­lu­tion or de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion is one such a case in point. De­vo­lu­tion has been a sub­ject on Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s lips for some time now. He talked de­vo­lu­tion dur­ing cam­paigns for the July 30 har­monised elec­tions and his op­po­nents dis­missed him as pol­i­tick­ing to earn votes from re­gions lag­ging be­hind eco­nom­i­cally. For many years, Zim­bab­weans have yearned for po­lit­i­cal de­vo­lu­tion - largely a cry for equal share of po­lit­i­cal po­si­tions as if the nation feeds on pol­i­tics. That era is dead. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is talk­ing eco­nomic de­vo­lu­tion. He is fol­low­ing the Chi­nese eco­nomic model step by step as if he has con­sumed a pa­per by Cheng­gang Xu on “Chi­nese Re­form and Chi­nese De­cen­tral­i­sa­tion” pub­lished 12 years ago. Chang­gang at­tributes China’s eco­nomic mir­a­cle to a re­form strat­egy un­der­pinned by what he terms “re­gional de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion”. Many are prob­a­bly won­der­ing what kind of struc­tural strat­egy this is? At the top of this hi­er­ar­chy is a cen­tral gov­ern­ment and be­low it are provin­cial struc­tures. Those put in charge of prov­inces have a big task of en­sur­ing mas­sive eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in their re­gions and have the ad­van­tage of be­ing in-situ and know, like the back of their hand, the nat­u­ral re­sources in the prov­inces ready for ex­ploita­tion. This, Chang­gang out­lines so graph­i­cally. Un­der the su­per­vi­sion of cen­tral gov­ern­ment, Chang­gang notes, re­gional gov­ern­ments - in our case prov­inces - ini­ti­ate de­vel­op­ment, im­ple­ment and ac­tion strate­gies in line with the de­mands and avail­abil­ity of re­sources in their ar­eas of in­flu­ence. For China, this process took close to 30 years to re­alise re­sults and this is un­der­stand­able as they were the pi­o­neers of such re­forms, but get me right, if ef­fi­ciently im­ple­mented in our case - Zim­babwe re­quires a third of such time to reg­is­ter his­toric eco­nomic turn­around. This prob­a­bly ex­plains why Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s eco­nomic vi­sion is premised on de­liv­er­ing a mid­dle-in­come econ­omy by 2030. The Chi­nese eco­nomic de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion re­forms process saw that coun­try’s Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct in­creas­ing eight­fold and turn­ing one of the world’s then poor­est economies into the sec­ond largest to­day. In the Chi­nese model, which Zim­babwe is ev­i­dently and right­fully so pur­su­ing, re­gional gov­ern­ments (prov­inces) are ma­jor ve­hi­cles of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. How? Ac­cord­ing to Chang­gang, the prov­inces drive eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment or in­flu­ence it, and at times re­sist in­ap­pro­pri­ate re­forms in ar­eas un­der their ju­ris­dic­tion. They con­trol the land, firms, fi­nan­cial re­sources and raw ma­te­ri­als, but cen­tral gov­ern­ment re­mains with a say in shap­ing the nation. For ex­am­ple, the set­ting up of re­gional gov­ern­ments is a duty of cen­tral gov­ern­ment. In China, it is done in a man­ner that in­cen­tivises per­for­mance by the ap­pointees. In fact, Chang­gang notes that in the Chi­nese model, ap­point­ment and pro­mo­tion of of­fi­cials in re­gional gov­ern­ments serve as an in­stru­ment by cen­tral gov­ern­ment to in­duce re­gional of­fi­cials to fol­low poli­cies of the cen­tre. With this model, eco­nomic gov­er­nance is del­e­gated to re­gional gov­ern­ments and the re­gional economies are self-con­tained. They pro­vide all the es­sen­tials in the re­gions. It is no longer the re­spon­si­bil­ity of cen­tral Gov­ern­ment, to for ex­am­ple, build a bridge, clinic or school in re­mote Kanyemba in Mashona­land Cen­tral or a dip tank in Garanyemba Ntepe-Guyo in Mata­bele­land South. The Chi­nese de­vo­lu­tion model del­e­gates even the han­dling of in­vestors - be they for­eign or lo­cal - to the re­gional gov­ern­ments, do­ing away with red tape (bu­reau­cracy) char­ac­ter­is­tic of the cen­tral­i­sa­tion model. Localisation of eco­nomics! And to en­cour­age per­for­mance by those in charge of the re­gions, the Chi­nese re­ward with pro­mo­tion into cen­tral Gov­ern­ment those in­di­vid­u­als in the re­gions who ex­cel. In other words, you do not get pro­moted if you are not a per­former, in­stead you risk the boot. No re­wards for bad per­form­ers and this maxim must ap­ply in our sit­u­a­tion. The era when of­fi­cials had guar­an­teed po­si­tions in Gov­ern­ment even when it was clear they were dead­wood must be con­fined to the First Repub­lic as history. In fact, in the First Repub­lic Min­is­ters of State for Provin­cial Af­fairs were full time party ac­tivists who had no iota of eco­nomics - talk of Mandi­itawepi of the “dhak­isi” in­famy. “When a re­gion has a higher growth rate than oth­ers, the head of that re­gion en­joys greater power and is more likely to get pro­mo­tion” - notes Chang­gang. So the de­vo­lu­tion model car­ries with it many mer­its if ex­e­cuted with the pre­ci­sion of a cae­sarean. The fact that eco­nomic de­ci­sions are made by a per­son or per­sons on the ground speaks to ef­fi­ciency and timely ex­e­cu­tion. By its na­ture, de­vo­lu­tion trims bu­reau­cracy. De­vo­lu­tion, in Chang­gang’s words, is a “stylised multi-re­gional gov­er­nance form in which ev­ery re­gion is self-con­tained”. This is what the nation ex­pects from the Provin­cial Min­is­ters of State, who took oath of of­fice be­fore Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa last week. Theirs is an easy duty - iden­ti­fy­ing eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties in ar­eas un­der their ju­ris­dic­tion. For one in charge of Man­i­ca­land, for ex­am­ple, the list is end­less there are un­tapped op­por­tu­ni­ties in tourism, tea, beans, forestry, su­gar cane, gold and di­a­mond min­ing and so forth. Or­gan­ised ex­ploita­tion of such sparks re­gional and by ex­ten­sion na­tional eco­nomic pros­per­ity. This is the Chi­nese way and dur­ing a visit to Guang­dong Prov­ince some­time in 2016, the gov­er­nor of that re­gion told our del­e­ga­tion their Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct stood at over US$300 bil­lion. A prov­ince with such GDP speaks vol­umes of the ex­tent the Chi­nese have em­braced de­vo­lu­tion to re­alise what some term “bizarre” eco­nomic pros­per­ity. The provin­cial min­is­ters must, there­fore, hit the ground run­ning for the time to work is now! Econ­omy, econ­omy, and econ­omy, every­thing else is sec­ondary.",津巴布韦

The World Bank in 2013 de­clared Rus­sia a high-in­come coun­try and presently it is con­sid­ered the sixth-largest econ­omy in the world by pur­chas­ing power par­ity. China con­tin­ues on a growth tra­jec­tory and is now com­pet­ing with the United States to be­come the world’s big­gest econ­omy. A June 2017 re­port by McKin­sey ti­tled “Dance of the Lions and Dragons” in­di­cated that China was now Africa’s big­gest eco­nomic part­ner. The vol­ume of trade be­tween Africa and China trade rose from $13 bil­lion in 2001 to $188 bil­lion in 2015. Suf­fice to say, the world is now full of po­ten­tial trad­ing part­ners. As Deng Xiaop­ing, the fa­ther of China’s eco­nomic mir­a­cle, once said, it doesn’t mat­ter if the cat is black or white as long as it catches mice. We have to keep our op­tions open. The ma­jor thrust of the new Gov­ern­ment should be in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and in­dus­trial devel­op­ment. Com­pa­nies need to be mod­ernised and re­tooled to cre­ate com­pet­i­tive­ness and ef­fi­cien­cies. It sim­ply means pro­duc­tion pro­cesses should be mech­a­nised and new pro­duc­tion meth­ods in­tro­duced. Al­ready, Gov­ern­ment has in­di­cated that the coun­try’s eco­nomic growth will be pred­i­cated on agri­cul­ture and min­ing. Com­mand Agri­cul­ture has put the coun­try on the path of food self-suf­fi­ciency, in­creased ru­ral in­comes and bet­ter liv­ing stan­dards. Agri­cul­ture’s in­flu­ence, as a sec­tor which sup­plies 60 per­cent of raw ma­te­ri­als to in­dus­try and em­ploys more than 70 per­cent, is per­va­sive. It means there is need for more agro-tech­nol­ogy and agro-pro­cess­ing. Put sim­ply, food se­cu­rity guar­an­tees devel­op­ment. The ball is now squarely in our court as Zim­bab­weans to en­sure that we en­hance the agri­cul­tural value chain. How­ever small the part we play, we should all con­trib­ute to the devel­op­ment of our coun­try. We ei­ther sink or swim to­gether.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200910,Global value chains as an eco­nomic strat­egy,"THE Africa Con­ti­nent Free Agree­ment AfCFTA is premised on ex­ist­ing re­gional eco­nomic blocs namely the COMESA, SADC, EAC, ECOWAS, IGAD, SEN-SAD, UMA and ECCA. Re­search re­veals that whereas these Pref­er­en­tial Treaty Agree­ments (PTAs) were driven by ad­just­ments on tar­iffs on in­dus­trial, agri­cul­tural and bor­der mea­sures, not much was cov­ered on sub­si­dies, coun­ter­vail­ing mea­sures, anti-dump­ing du­ties and trade reme­dies. The AfCFTA has cov­ered more poli­cies than in PTAs. This is re­flec­tive of mod­ern deep trade agree­ments typ­i­fied by the likes of NAFTA and the EU. This will en­able AfCFTA mem­ber states to in­crease their par­tic­i­pa­tion in global value chains (GVCs) and re­gional value chains. Re­gional value chains re­fer to cross bor­der pro­duc­tion within the same eco­nomic bloc while global value chains re­fer to joint pro­duc­tion be­tween coun­tries of dif­fer­ent eco­nomic bloc. East Asia, Europe and North Amer­ica are en­gaged in ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices, so­phis­ti­cated in­no­va­tion GVCs, in com­par­i­son to Latin Amer­ica, Africa and Cen­tral Asia who are en­gaged in com­modi­ties GVCs and lim­ited man­u­fac­tur­ing GVCs. The World Bank re­ports that deep trade agree­ments en­cour­age global value chain and re­gional value re­lated trade. In ad­di­tion, this type of agree­ment en­cour­ages har­mon­i­sa­tion of cus­toms pro­ce­dures across bor­ders, cer­tainty and pre­dictabil­ity in trade through the elim­i­na­tion of trade bar­ri­ers. It is the na­ture of the AfCFTA as a deep trade agree­ment that will en­cour­age global value chains and re­gional value chains for Africa’s pro­duc­tiv­ity and achieve in­creased economies of scale. Sta­tis­tics re­veal that man­u­fac­tured in­tra-Africa ex­ports are at 36 per­cent in com­par­i­son to 24 per­cent to the rest of the world. The AfCFTA will stim­u­late MSMEs to man­u­fac­ture and thus pro­pel these busi­nesses to par­tic­i­pate in re­gional and global value chains to in­crease the vol­ume of ex­ports. On the back­ground of the Covid-19 that has al­most wiped economies and in­creased con­ver­sa­tions of pro­tec­tion­ism, the AfCFTA has to en­cour­age its mem­bers to take up value added man­u­fac­tur­ing and in­no­va­tive ac­tiv­i­ties in or­der for Africa to ef­fec­tively par­tic­i­pate in global value chains. More­over, the suc­cess of the AfCFTA is hinged on vig­or­ous ex­port strate­gies to be pur­sued by mem­ber coun­tries. Stud­ies by the World Bank re­veal that global value chain par­tic­i­pa­tion can boost eco­nomic growth by 6 or 7 times more than tra­di­tional ex­ports pro­duced in a coun­try. How­ever, Sub–Sa­hara Africa GVC par­tic­i­pa­tion re­mains very low at 3 per­cent in trade of in­ter­me­di­ate goods. Fur­ther­more, some Sub–Sa­hara African ex­ports en­ter GVCs at the be­gin­ning re­al­is­ing a lesser share through the ex­port of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and com­modi­ties with no value ad­di­tion in con­trast to coun­tries that join the GVC at a higher share due to value ad­di­tion that oc­curred on the ex­ported fin­ished prod­uct. Tan­za­nia, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Africa and Morocco have man­aged to be ef­fec­tive par­tic­i­pants in the GVCs reap­ing pos­i­tive ben­e­fits for their economies. This has been achieved through value ad­di­tion through im­por­ta­tion of in­ter­me­di­aries for the fin­ished prod­ucts be­fore ex­port. The in­te­gra­tion into the GVCs by Ethiopia and Kenya has oc­curred in the agribusi­ness, ap­parel sec­tors. Tan­za­nia has in­te­grated through the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, tourism and trans­port al­though in these last two sec­tors in­te­gra­tion into GVCs has been very low. Peu­geot and Re­nault have set up shop in Morocco, mak­ing this African coun­try one of the play­ers in the au­to­mo­bile global value chain. The men­tioned African coun­tries have scored highly on GVCs and ac­tu­ally mir­ror the GVC suc­cess sto­ries of Viet­nam and Poland. It is im­por­tant to know that firms drive in­te­gra­tion into GVCs while govern­ments cre­ate an en­abling en­vi­ron­ment for such growth to oc­cur. An ef­fi­cient cus­toms ad­min­is­tra­tion among a host of other fac­tors be­comes a cat­a­lyst for seam­less trade to oc­cur. Em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence by the World Bank has shown that firms that im­port and ex­port at the same time are likely to par­tic­i­pate in GVCs. It is com­mon that the im­ports will com­prise of in­ter­me­di­aries that will be an in­put into the fin­ished prod­uct to be ex­ported. Firms in­te­grated in GVCs ex­ploit economies of scale and com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage as a strat­egy to con­tain costs. The na­ture of the GVCs is such they are re­la­tional and largely driven by high spe­cial­i­sa­tion among other at­tributes. GVCs foster co-op­er­a­tion be­tween coun­tries be­cause of this in­ter­de­pen­dence. This there­fore, de­mands care­ful plan­ning on trade poli­cies that should re­flect the in­ter­est of other coun­tries. How of­ten does that hap­pen? The cur­rent US and China tar­iff wars re­veal the com­plex­ity of in­ter­na­tional trade. The syn­chro­ni­sa­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity means that a trade shock in another coun­try cas­cades to the other coun­try. This has been the case glob­ally on the on­set of the coro­n­avirus. In­fla­tion from the other trad­ing part­ner can be im­ported into the coun­try and to avoid this, Cen­tral Banks of coun­tries in the GVCs have to work to­gether to man­age the in­her­ent risk of im­port­ing in­fla­tion. Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones are a com­mon fea­ture found in GVCs and they largely em­ploy women. UNCTAD re­search re­veals that some man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses in SEZ re­quire repet­i­tive tasks and women are said to have nim­ble fin­gers, which make them ideal for tasks like em­broi­dery. While hailed for em­ploy­ing women and re­duc­ing poverty, the down­side of SEZ is that they per­pet­u­ate gen­der in­equal­ity. The po­si­tions re­served for women work­ing within SEZ have no scope for per­sonal growth turn­ing women into sources of cheap labour. The im­pact of GVCs on the en­vi­ron­ment has been a ma­jor con­cern. In­ter­na­tional trade ac­counts for 7 per­cent of car­bon emis­sions in the world and that has been as­so­ci­ated with GVCs. Zim­babwe has some of the req­ui­sites for the es­tab­lish­ment of more GVCs and RVCS. These are a good phys­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture, a sound Cus­toms Ad­min­is­tra­tion, a le­gal and reg­u­la­tory busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, ed­u­cated and skilled hu­man cap­i­tal. Not­with­stand­ing down­side of GVCs and RVCs, these ve­hi­cles boost economies as ev­i­denced by suc­cess sto­ries of Morocco and Ethiopia. The AfCFTA as a deep agree­ment, it will eas­ily as­sist mem­ber coun­tries to in­te­grate in the re­gional value chains as well as global value chains. ◆ Sit­shengisiwe Ndlovu pres­i­dent of OWITZIMBABWE: MBA/UNCTAD: Trade and Gen­der Link­ages/ IAC Dip/Cert: Trade in Ser­vices and SDGs: Robert Schu­man Cen­tre of Ad­vanced Stud­ies/ IDEPCert: Mak­ing the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Agree­ment Work.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201021,The is­sue of debt,"THIS past Sun­day, our church ser­mon was taken from Ne­hemiah Chap­ter 10 and fo­cused on the in­struc­tions given to the tribes of Is­rael which had re­turned to Is­rael from exile in Baby­lon about 400 years be­fore Christ. It is clear from this ac­count that the lead­ers of the Jewish peo­ple at that time were de­ter­mined to es­tab­lish a Jewish na­tion in the re­gion and that this na­tion should fol­low the ba­sic prin­ci­ples laid out for th­ese peo­ple in the first five books of the Bi­ble. As an econ­o­mist and some­one who has spent his whole life con­nected in one way or an­other to agri­cul­ture, I was par­tic­u­larly taken by the ad­mo­ni­tion that the na­tion should ob­serve two eco­nomic prin­ci­ples — that of rest on the sev­enth day of the week and the sev­enth year for all agri­cul­tural land. The other prin­ci­ple was that of the Ju­bilee the for­give­ness of all debt ev­ery seven years. Noth­ing could be more cen­tral to con­tem­po­rary eco­nom­ics than the is­sue of debt. The Asian Tiger economies — so de­scribed be­cause they have been able to al­most uni­ver­sally drag them­selves out of poverty in less than 50 years through a process of ex­port­driven growth fu­elled by debt. The lev­els of debt that they have ac­cu­mu­lated is stag­ger­ing and his­tor­i­cally un­par­al­leled. Ja­pan and China lead the pack with na­tional debts of 2,5 times their gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP). In other words, if th­ese two coun­tries spent their en­tire eco­nomic out­put on pay­ing back their debt, it would take them nearly three years. All of the Asian Tiger States have fol­lowed this route. By con­trast, the na­tional debt of the United States is about equal to their na­tional GDP — only 40% of the debt lev­els of the Asian States even af­ter the mas­sive ex­pen­di­ture fol­low­ing the global bank cri­sis and now the at­tempt to hold the econ­omy steady dur­ing the COVID-19 cri­sis. The other great ad­van­tage of the United States is that its debt is in its own cur­rency. The debts of most na­tions are mostly held in United States dol­lars and are, there­fore, much more vul­ner­a­ble to global shifts in val­ues. I would not be sur­prised if to­tal global debt, held by na­tion States does not now ex­ceed global eco­nomic out­put. We owe oth­ers more than we pro­duce. In sim­ple terms we are liv­ing on a limb, sup­ported by noth­ing more than mas­sive amounts of debt that we can never hope to re­pay. The as­ton­ish­ing thing is that the debt is­sue does not end with na­tional debt, it ex­tends to cor­po­rate debt and to in­di­vid­ual debt. I un­der­stand that credit card debt in an ad­vanced coun­try is of­ten greater than its na­tional debt. We are wal­low­ing in a sea of debt and very few coun­tries could main­tain their stan­dard of liv­ing with­out debt. Zim­babwe stopped ser­vic­ing its na­tional debt a long time ago — per­haps more than 20 years ago and we are now in de­fault with all mul­ti­lat­eral agen­cies and with most coun­tries. Al­most no­body will lend us money and we are be­ing charged penalty rates of in­ter­est on all our his­tor­i­cal li­a­bil­i­ties. I was as­tounded to dis­cover the other day that of our main na­tional debt of about US$10 bil­lion, only US$4 bil­lion was the orig­i­nal sum borrowed — the rest is in­ter­est and penal­ties. Even the World Bank jumped on the band­wagon and is charg­ing us nearly 10% in­ter­est on our debt with it — five times what we should be charged. There are no saints in this busi­ness. Those of us who live in Zim­babwe have had our sav­ings wiped out twice by inflation — first be­tween 2005 and 2008 and now since late 2018. In my case, I paid a lo­cal in­surance com­pany more than US$1,4 mil­lion over a pe­riod from 1957. What should have af­forded me a pen­sion of US$4 000 a month today, it pays me a monthly pen­sion of US$5. I can still re­mem­ber my fa­ther telling me when I got my first salary af­ter leav­ing school that I had to start sav­ing for my re­tire­ment. I would never re­peat that ad­vice to my chil­dren. I sup­ported my fa­ther af­ter he re­tired, un­til he died. But the other side of this equa­tion was that nearly all lo­cal debts were wiped out. Any­one who owed money to oth­ers for what­ever rea­son, was able to liq­ui­date the debt with a tiny sum in real money. Sto­ries of peo­ple sell­ing a bot­tle of whisky and pay­ing their bond on the house off, are le­gion. Any firm op­er­at­ing on ac­cu­mu­lated cash sav­ings — banks, build­ing so­ci­eties and in­surance and pen­sion funds found them­selves bank­rupt. But we were and still are largely debt free as in­di­vid­u­als and firms. Firms with ex­ter­nal debts are in deep trou­ble and the State has had to step in and take over th­ese li­a­bil­i­ties or face the re­al­ity that the com­pa­nies would go into liq­ui­da­tion. Just imag­ine what would hap­pen if we had to give to­tal debt re­lief ev­ery sev­enth year. It would in­volve a mas­sive trans­fer of real wealth to the coun­tries and in­di­vid­u­als and even the com­pa­nies who owed money and would cost the peo­ple with “old money” very dearly. But overnight it would cre­ate a more equal world. Per­haps that was the goal of the Cre­ator when he laid down how his peo­ple should live. The one thing we all know is that the debt-driven world has cre­ated a global econ­omy which has be­come ever more un­equal — the gap be­tween the haves and the have nots has grown wider in this cen­tury and shows no signs of slow­ing down. The global debt sys­tem is based on trust and per­ceived risk. If peo­ple with money are sat­is­fied that you or your com­pany or your coun­try, can be trusted with ac­cu­mu­lated money and will ser­vice the in­ter­est on time and be able to pay it back when the con­tracts are con­cluded, then you can bor­row al­most un­lim­ited funds and at very low in­ter­est rates.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200718,"Covid-19 death toll passes 583k, US records over 67k new cases","MORE than 13,59 mil­lion peo­ple have been re­ported to be in­fected by the novel coro­n­avirus glob­ally and 583 005 have died, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally. In­fec­tions have been re­ported in more than 210 coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries since the first cases were iden­ti­fied in China in De­cem­ber 2019. The United States posted a new daily record of 67 632 new coro­n­avirus cases in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, which tracks the spread of the dis­ease. The global leader in in­fec­tions has seen a surge in the virus since late June, mostly in the south and west of the coun­try. Res­i­dents in Los An­ge­les, Cal­i­for­nia, line up in their cars to get tested for coro­n­avirus at Dodger Sta­dium, as cases surge in the Golden state. For the past 10 days, the num­ber of new cases be­ing re­ported has been be­tween 55 000 and 65 000 ev­ery 24 hours. South Africa’s cases of Covid-19 were set to reach 300 000 on Wed­nes­day, the most in Africa and in the top 10 in the world, de­spite a swiftly im­posed lock­down aimed at pre­vent­ing in­fec­tions spi­ralling as they did in the West. Africa’s most in­dus­tri­alised na­tion has 298 292 cases at the last count, and with pos­i­tive tests now in­creas­ing at a rate of more than 10 000 a day, it is all but cer­tain to vault over the 300 000 mark when the min­istry re­leases nightly fig­ures on Wed­nes­day. At the end of March, Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa took ag­gres­sive, early ac­tion, shut­ting shops, or­der­ing peo­ple to stay at home and send­ing the army on to the streets to en­force it — when South Africa had only 400 cases and no recorded deaths. The gov­ern­ment later eased many curbs over fears for its strug­gling econ­omy. But with the world’s fourth-largest daily in­crease in coro­n­avirus cases in a coun­try of 58 mil­lion peo­ple, an ex­as­per­ated Ramaphosa on Sun­day reim­posed an al­co­hol ban and a night cur­few. “South Africa went into lock­down . . . so early, (it looked) . . . re­ally im­pres­sive,” said Charles Robert­son, a se­nior econ­o­mist at Re­nais­sance Cap­i­tal, who has been closely tracking the coro­n­avirus. “What be­came clear is that lock­downs don’t work in low-in­come coun­tries,” he said. “In in­for­mal economies, (peo­ple) . . . can’t af­ford to stay at home.” About half of South Africans live in poverty, and about a third are un­em­ployed — some three mil­lion have lost their jobs since the lock­down be­gan, ac­cord­ing to a study by South Africa’s Coro­n­avirus Rapid Mo­bile Sur­vey (CRAM) re­leased on Tues­day. In many parts of the coun­try, Covid-19 wards are packed, so pa­tients are spilling out into other bits of hos­pi­tals and into tents out­side, health of­fi­cials say. “The storm that we have con­sis­tently warned South Africans about is now ar­riv­ing,” Health Min­is­ter Zweli Mkhize told par­lia­ment. At just 4 346 deaths, barely 1,5% of cases have proved fa­tal so far, in part be­cause of a young pop­u­la­tion. That will rise as short­ages of oxy­gen and hos­pi­tal beds worsen. Ramaphosa said sci­en­tists had pre­dicted up to 50 000 deaths. “We are see­ing a sys­tem that’s un­der pres­sure, not un­der dis­as­ter col­lapse . . . But it’s tak­ing a huge strain,” Charl van Log­geren­berg, head of emer­gency medicine at Life Health­care, which has pri­vate hos­pi­tals treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients across the coun­try, told Reuters. At pub­lic hos­pi­tals, which were strug­gling with ca­pac­ity any­way, medics have com­plained about a lack of staff and pro­tec­tive equip­ment. “Not enough health work­ers have been hired, our re­quests for PPE have been ig­nored, guide­lines are not be­ing fol­lowed,” said Si­bongiseni Delih­lazo, spokesman for the main nurses’ union. Gaut­eng, the prov­ince at the epi­cen­tre and home to the big­gest city, Jo­han­nes­burg, is adding beds, set­ting up field hos­pi­tals, and boost­ing num­bers of med­i­cal work­ers, said Kwara Kekana, a spokes­woman for the pro­vin­cial health depart­ment. Mean­while, Ethiopian mother Alemt­se­hay Nasir went to Le­banon dream­ing that her maid’s job would let her earn money to make a bet­ter life for her young son. But she was fired when the Covid-19 pan­demic hit and her em­ploy­ers dumped her on the streets. The 32-year-old was left on the curb out­side the Ethiopian con­sulate in a sub­urb of Beirut, one of hun­dreds of women aban­doned by em­ploy­ers without the means to get home af­ter the pan­demic hit, on top of a fi­nan­cial cri­sis that has dev­as­tated the Le­banese econ­omy. Le­banese labour laws of­fer lit­tle pro­tec­tion for mi­grant work­ers. The best the women can hope for is that a char­ity will help them get home. “They just take them out and dump them on the streets with their be­long­ings,” Alemt­se­hay told Reuters. “Even right now, there are many women on the streets, wait­ing for some­one to come to their res­cue.” Ethiopia ac­counts for the big­gest per­cent­age of mi­grant work­ers in Le­banon, ac­cord­ing to Le­banese gov­ern­ment data. In May, Alemt­se­hay was one of around 650 women re­turned to Ethiopia on a flight or­gan­ised by Ad­dis Ababa au­thor­i­ties and the United Na­tions’ In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion (IOM). Another woman on the flight said she had been dumped without her wages or pass­port and ar­rested for not hav­ing iden­ti­fi­ca­tion. She didn’t want Reuters to iden­tify her for fear that traf­fick­ers that she paid to bring her to Le­banon would track her down and force her to re­pay her debts. Mau­reen Achieng, IOM’s chief of mis­sion in Ethiopia, said women were still keen to work in Le­banon de­spite the hor­ror sto­ries. In Bri­tain, spec­ta­tors will be al­lowed back into some sports events in Eng­land from next week as coro­n­avirus preven­tion mea­sures are tested ahead of a planned wider re­open­ing of sta­di­ums in Oc­to­ber.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200716,COVID-19 me­dia cov­er­age must avoid mis­takes made on Aids pan­demic,"AS COVID-19 be­comes the most in­tensely cov­ered virus in his­tory, there are im­por­tant lessons to be drawn from the me­dia’s re­port­ing of another global pan­demic: HIV and Aids. Whose lives the world deems wor­thy of sav­ing de­pends, at least partly, on the sto­ries that jour­nal­ists tell. This was one of the find­ings of my re­search into Bri­tish me­dia cov­er­age of Africa’s Aids pan­demic, in which I an­a­lysed 1 281 news re­ports be­tween 1987 and 2008. At the height of that pan­demic, jour­nal­ists helped to ex­pose how in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty laws and the busi­ness mod­els of big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies dis­re­garded the health needs of those liv­ing in poorer coun­tries. Such re­port­ing played an im­por­tant role in cre­at­ing the po­lit­i­cal mo­men­tum for the mass roll-out of life-sav­ing treat­ment across the global south. But Aids also pro­vides a darker les­son about the ca­pac­ity of the me­dia to nor­malise mil­lions of deaths tak­ing place around us. Bury­ing the story — and the dead Un­til the late 1990s, mil­lions of peo­ple dy­ing of Aids-re­lated causes across sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa were a non-is­sue for the Bri­tish me­dia, much like the ini­tial wave of coro­n­avirus deaths in China barely reg­is­tered on the in­ter­na­tional me­dia radar. My anal­y­sis showed that BBC News re­ported only 14 times about Aids in Africa be­tween 1987 and 1995, mostly in pass­ing. The Fi­nan­cial Times car­ried a mere 18 sto­ries in the same pe­riod. Lit­tle changed fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of life-sav­ing an­tiretro­vi­ral ther­apy in 1996, which re­mained out of reach for the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple liv­ing with HIV and Aids. In 1999, there were more than 24 mil­lion HIV-pos­i­tive peo­ple in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Some coun­tries saw preva­lence rates rise above 20%. Yet, by then the pan­demic had mer­ited just one front-page story in the Bri­tish Press. As late as 2001, The Econ­o­mist con­cluded that: “The world is not go­ing to res­cue Africa from Aids. Only Africans can do that, by chang­ing their be­hav­iour.” The spec­tac­u­lar con­cen­tra­tion of the pan­demic in Africa, Econ­o­mist read­ers were told, was driven by Africans’ pre­sumed hy­per-sex­u­al­ity, cul­tural “myths” and the in­com­pe­tence of the con­ti­nent’s lead­ers. Poverty was also to blame, since, as the magazine wrote in 1998, “those who can­not af­ford tele­vi­sion find other ways of pass­ing the evening.” Rooted in thinly-veiled racist as­sump­tions, these as­ser­tions steered at­ten­tion away from the ways that the rules of the global eco­nomic or­der un­der­mined the pub­lic health ca­pac­i­ties of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The global Aids pan­demic has been shaped by the com­plex in­ter­play of epi­demi­o­log­i­cal, be­havioural and cul­tural fac­tors. But its un­equal dis­tri­bu­tion is also linked to the pun­ish­ing legacy of ex­ter­nal debt and con­di­tions for gov­ern­men­tal re­forms im­posed on the con­ti­nent by the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund and World Bank. Stephen Lewis, the United Na­tions’ for­mer Spe­cial En­voy for HIV and Aids in Africa, de­nounced this as “a form of cap­i­tal­ist Stal­in­ism” that dec­i­mated Africa’s health care in­fra­struc­ture dur­ing the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, in more than two decades, I found only one in­stance that ex­plic­itly linked the Aids cri­sis to Africa’s en­counter with ne­olib­er­al­ism. Pub­lished in The Guardian in July 2000, it was a let­ter to the ed­i­tor by a med­i­cal aid worker en­ti­tled “Our guilt in the land of the dy­ing”. It is this ca­pac­ity of me­dia re­port­ing to mask the way that pan­demics are shaped by the world’s grotesque in­equal­i­ties that is per­haps the most dis­qui­et­ing find­ing of my re­search as COVID-19 spreads to coun­tries with frag­ile health care sys­tems. Of prof­its, patents and power The strug­gle over ac­cess to life-sav­ing HIV medicines that took place at the turn of the mil­len­nium showed that this need not be the case. Pit­ting the world’s pow­er­ful phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies against a coali­tion of ac­tivists and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, the in­ter­na­tional me­dia be­came a cen­tral arena in which this bat­tle un­folded. In the early 2000s, Aids sud­denly be­came the sub­ject of front­page news, op-eds and in­ves­tiga­tive re­ports as jour­nal­ists shone the spot­light on the murky world of in­ter­na­tional trade pol­i­tics, ex­pos­ing how Western gov­ern­ments were col­lud­ing with drug com­pa­nies in pro­tect­ing their patents. The story of prof­its, patents and power be­came en­veloped in deeply em­pa­thetic ac­counts of hu­man suf­fer­ing. Aids suf­fer­ers were no longer mere ob­jects of our pity or moral judge­ment. They now had names, fam­i­lies, friends, and tan­gi­ble places of ori­gin, as in The Guardian’s “Sav­ing Grace” se­ries from Malawi. This pe­riod was ex­cep­tional in the his­tory of the me­dia’s treat­ment of HIV and Aids — though since the mid-2000s cov­er­age has de­clined sharply. Coro­n­avirus warn­ings As the search for COVID-19 vac­cines in­ten­si­fies, jour­nal­ists must ag­gres­sively ques­tion whether gov­ern­ments and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies are en­act­ing all mea­sures to en­sure uni­ver­sal ac­cess. It’s déjà vu for those who led the cam­paign for ac­cess to af­ford­able Aids drugs. Alarmed by the prospect of prof­i­teer­ing by big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, they are con­cerned that coro­n­avirus treat­ments may again re­main out of reach of the less priv­i­leged. There are some hope­ful signs that big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms will not seek to ag­gres­sively as­sert their mo­nop­oly rights. Per­haps they are fear­ful of another mon­u­men­tal pub­lic re­la­tions de­ba­cle, as oc­curred when a num­ber of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms sued the South African gov­ern­ment over Aids drugs in 2001. Still, some ex­perts are less san­guine about COVID-19, and fear it will be phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies who ul­ti­mately de­cide who lives and who dies. How COVID-19 will end de­pends, in part, on the script that jour­nal­ists write and their abil­ity to tell sto­ries that ac­knowl­edge pan­demics are al­ways rooted in the his­tory of ac­cu­mu­lated global in­equal­i­ties — and so our own role within them. With all eyes on the coro­n­avirus, it’s sober­ing that HIV and Aids con­tin­ues to claim al­most half a mil­lion lives in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa alone every year.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200611,"COVID-19: Stigma, in­equal­ity, and men­tal health im­pact","IN Jan­uary 2020, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) de­clared the out­break of a new coro­n­avirus dis­ease, COVID-19, a pub­lic health emer­gency of in­ter­na­tional con­cern. As at June 10, 2020, the world had recorded 7,04 mil­lion con­firmed cases and 404 000 deaths. Of these, Zim­babwe had 314 con­firmed cases and four deaths In the back­drop of the ex­ten­sive phys­i­cal health cov­er­age about the pan­demic, we need to be re­minded that the world was al­ready seized with a ma­jor men­tal health cri­sis be­fore the COVID-19 pan­demic. About one in ev­ery four, al­ready ex­pe­ri­enc­ing some form of men­tal health con­di­tion. How­ever, it re­mained un­justly ig­nored, partly be­cause of faulty un­der­stand­ing of the mat­ter and lack of re­sources to prop­erly mit­i­gate it. In some parts of the world, gov­ern­ments are start­ing to act af­ter re­al­is­ing the eco­nomic cost of ig­nor­ing the men­tal health cri­sis, some­thing we can­not af­ford to do in these COVID-19 try­ing times. Even more with the knowl­edge that with­out COVID-19, de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety alone were pro­jected to cost the global econ­omy an es­ti­mated $1 tril­lion each year in lost productivity. As the COVID-19 pan­demic con­tin­ues to com­pli­cate, so will the men­tal health cri­sis. Un­for­tu­nately the lat­ter will be with us for much longer with some cases only be­com­ing ap­par­ent in months and even years to come. So, as we plot our ways in the un­char­tered ter­ri­to­ries of COVID-19 re­sponse, all play­ers need to be re­minded of the chronic na­ture of the men­tal health cri­sis and that there will be “no health with­out men­tal health”. Even more when the pan­demic is, like in our case, com­pli­cated by poverty, stigma, and in­equal­ity, and set to have a more dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on men­tal health that will be long last­ing. Ev­i­dence on the ac­tual men­tal health im­pact of the COVID-19 pan­demic in Zim­babwe is still emerg­ing, and we need to be proac­tive about seek­ing and ap­ply­ing it. It is in­ter­est­ing to note that re­spon­si­ble play­ers are al­ready work­ing on it with some or­gan­i­sa­tions pro­vid­ing tele­health where it is fea­si­ble. The early pic­ture de­vel­op­ing from our set­ting and other se­verely af­fected re­gions like China, Amer­ica and Europe is show­ing in­creased mod­er­ate-to-se­vere post­trau­matic stress symp­toms, stress, de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety, and sub­stance use dis­or­ders. This is largely be­cause the COVID-19 pan­demic is com­ing with ex­po­sure to some known risk fac­tors for stress, de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety in­clud­ing high mor­tal­ity rate, re­source and food in­se­cu­rity, dis­crim­i­na­tion, and ex­pe­ri­ence with in­fected and sick in­di­vid­u­als, which can lead to more ad­verse men­tal health out­comes. These men­tal health chal­lenges have been re­ported among health­care work­ers, per­sons with COVID-19, their care­givers, and the gen­er­al­ity of those ex­posed or at in­creased risk. In ad­di­tion to the hu­man toll, these men­tal health chal­lenges also have im­pli­ca­tions on work, re­sult­ing in de­creased productivity. Peo­ple will have dif­fi­culty con­cen­trat­ing, take longer to ac­com­plish tasks, have dif­fi­culty think­ing and prob­lem­solv­ing, pro­cras­ti­nate on chal­leng­ing work as­sign­ments and have dif­fi­culty mul­ti­task­ing and ful­fill­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. Part of the man­age­ment strate­gies to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus in­clud­ing lock­down, quar­an­tine and iso­la­tion mea­sures will have ad­verse psy­choso­cial im­pacts on us. Peo­ple will re­spond to these in dif­fer­ent ways depend­ing on their life cir­cum­stances. How­ever, what is con­stant is that our lives will be dis­rupted and we need to ad­just. Un­for­tu­nately, many do not have the men­tal and eco­nomic re­sources to cope in adap­tive ways. Some neg­a­tive men­tal health im­pacts will kick in and these are signs to look for: Dras­tic changes in sleep­ing pat­terns — mostly in­som­nia Changes in ap­petite Ex­treme mood changes — eas­ily get­ting an­gry, ag­i­tated, or ir­ri­ta­ble or feel­ing ex­tremely sad Se­vere tired­ness and feel­ing eas­ily fa­tigued Los­ing in­ter­est in the things you loved to do With­drawal from fam­ily mem­bers and friends Dif­fi­culty in fo­cus­ing or con­cen­trat­ing De­sire to in­crease al­co­hol or to­bacco use The men­tal health ser­vices re­main avail­able, and peo­ple are en­cour­aged to seek help early for op­ti­mum re­sults. The Health and Child Care min­istry has con­sti­tuted a psy­choso­cial treat­ment work­ing group to re­spond on the psy­choso­cial im­pacts of COVID-19. Men­tal health im­pact on pro­fes­sion­als The men­tal health of the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion also de­pends on that of peo­ple who serve them in cri­sis times like these. For the men­tal health of our front­line work­ers, WHO ad­vises that re­spon­si­ble au­thor­i­ties be proac­tive on meet­ing their ba­sic needs. By pro­tect­ing our health and so­cial care staff from chronic stress and poor men­tal health, we pro­tect our own health and pro­mote so­ci­etal well­be­ing. This will boost their abil­ity to per­form their du­ties. Re­spon­sive and eth­i­cal lead­er­ship that de­liv­ers qual­ity com­mu­ni­ca­tion and ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion up­dates to all staff can also help avert men­tal health chal­lenges among front­line work­ers. COVID-19 will also def­i­nitely have its men­tal health toll on our na­tional lead­er­ship and line man­agers. Most of them will be forced to make dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions as they op­er­ate on a sur­vival men­tal­ity mode. This will in­crease the risk for work-re­lated stress, burnout, com­pas­sion fa­tigue and other oc­cu­pa­tional dis­or­ders. If this is not ad­dressed, men­tal health chal­lenges will rise in this group and man­i­fest as ab­sen­teeism, pre­sen­tism, and poor per­for­mance. It is, there­fore, cru­cial that our COVID-19 re­sponse in­cor­po­rate pre­ven­ta­tive men­tal health strate­gies for all key groups. The lev­els of stress they en­counter can be sig­nif­i­cantly low­ered by ap­ply­ing coach­ing, men­tor­ship and bas­ing their de­ci­sions on sound sci­en­tific ev­i­dence. The in­equal­ity di­men­sions While we un­der­stand that COVID-19 does not dis­crim­i­nate, so is the men­tal health im­pact, in­equal­i­ties are quite ev­i­dent in the way we are af­fected. In our sit­u­a­tion of a pre­dom­i­nantly in­for­mal econ­omy, peo­ple with the most pre­car­i­ous liveli­hoods, those with pre-ex­ist­ing men­tal health con­di­tions, the el­derly, per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties and those in abu­sive re­la­tion­ships have a greater risk and should have spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion. Most peo­ple in in­for­mal trades fear for their fi­nan­cial fu­ture which was al­ready strained by pre­vail­ing eco­nomic hard­ships.

zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201031,Zim­bab­weans turn to sex work amid eco­nomic cri­sis and COVID-19,"DRESSED in a mini-skirt and blouse, Es­ther Kamupunga stood in semi-dark­ness wait­ing for men look­ing for sex - the lat­est Zim­bab­wean to lose her job in a deep­en­ing eco­nomic cri­sis, wors­ened by the new coro­n­avirus. When the first COVID-19 case was de­tected in March, Zim­babwe rapidly went into lock­down, and the 24-yearold sin­gle mother and wait­ress was laid off in the east­ern city of Mutare. “Life was bet­ter un­til the ad­vent of this coro­n­avirus. Our busi­ness came to a stand­still due to lock­down ... un­for­tu­nately I was one of the peo­ple who were re­trenched,” she said, shield­ing her face from pass­ing car head­lights. “I have two chil­dren. I could not watch them go­ing to bed with­out eat­ing any­thing. I had no op­tion but to fol­low some friends to this shop­ping cen­tre,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foun­da­tion, de­clin­ing to pub­lish her real name. The south­ern African na­tion is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing its worst eco­nomic cri­sis in a decade, with crip­pling hy­per­in­fla­tion, un­em­ploy­ment, strikes by pub­lic work­ers and short­ages of food, medicine and for­eign cur­rency. Com­mer­cial sex work­ers and char­i­ties pro­vid­ing them with health care ser­vices said the num­ber of women sell­ing sex has in­creased, par­tic­u­larly young girls fac­ing hunger at home. “We have a lot of cases com­ing to us of girls who were now en­gaged in trans­ac­tional sex be­cause of the in­crease in the house­hold poverty,” said Beatrice Savadye, di­rec­tor of Roots Africa, a lo­cal char­ity sup­port­ing young peo­ple. Savadye said she re­ceived 350 re­ports of chil­dren hav­ing sex in ex­change for money or gifts from March to June — dou­ble the pre­vi­ous year — in Ma­zowe, a min­ing town 40 km north of Harare. Her char­ity has been giv­ing food parcels to hun­gry fam­i­lies. Or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans say life is dif­fi­cult, with in­fla­tion above 700%, rock­et­ing prices for ba­sic goods, elec­tric­ity and petrol, and lag­ging salaries - prompt­ing teach­ers to refuse to re­turn to work with­out a pay rise last month. “Hunger drives us into sex trade,” said Hazel Ze­mura, who has sold sex for a decade and works for Women Against All Forms of Dis­crim­i­na­tion, which runs health pro­grammes for sex work­ers. “As our in­comes, like the cross bor­der trad­ing — the im­por­ta­tion of weaves and makeup kits from China for re­sale — got eroded dur­ing the lock­down, we had to turn to men for sur­vival.” The lat­est govern­ment data shows 16% of Zim­bab­weans were un­em­ployed in 2019, but many re­gard this as an un­der­es­ti­mate. The lock­down, fol­lowed by a cur­few in July, forced traders off the streets, while the clo­sure of Zim­babwe’s bor­ders for all non-es­sen­tial travel cut off a life­line for 1 mil­lion in­for­mal cross-bor­der traders, said econ­o­mist Vic­tor Bhoroma. “COVID-19 has ex­ac­er­bated an al­ready dire sit­u­a­tion in terms of em­ploy­ment,” the in­de­pen­dent an­a­lyst said from the cap­i­tal Harare, adding that about 6 mil­lion Zim­bab­weans who work in small busi­nesses and in­for­mal trade were se­verely af­fected. “The lock­downs in the tourism and hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, trans­port, avi­a­tion and leisure ser­vices, man­u­fac­tur­ing, fast food and re­tail­ing and sports have re­sulted in mas­sive re­trench­ments and lay­offs in the last seven months,” he added. Zim­babwe has recorded some 8,300 coro­n­avirus cases and about 250 deaths, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. Un­pro­tected sex Coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions have made sex work riskier as women have been un­able to get free con­doms from their usual clin­ics and il­le­gal broth­els in res­i­den­tial ar­eas and down­town night­clubs have closed. “Some sex work­ers, be­cause they do not have con­doms, they would put a cloth up their vagina to pre­vent preg­nancy and con­tract­ing HIV. Af­ter sex they would re­move the cloth and wash it for re­use with an­other client,” said Savadye of Roots Africa. But Ze­mura said some of her mem­bers chose not to use con­doms be­cause they can charge more. “Un­pro­tected sex pays more. So at times we have it de­spite the risks,” she said. e clo­sure of broth­els has pushed sex work­ers into riskier places, like se­cluded fields and de­serted build­ings, said Char­maine Dube, pro­gramme co­or­di­na­tor for the sex worker rights group Pow Wow in Bu­l­awayo, Zim­babwe’s sec­ond largest city. Many broth­els re­main closed, al­though the eas­ing of the cur­few — with peo­ple told to stay home from 8pm to 6am — has al­lowed sex work­ers back on to the streets, she said. Kamupunga, the ex-wait­ress, takes cients who pay for a “short time” to an open field, for which she charges about $2, al­though she is of­ten pushed to ac­cept half that. “We lie on a cloth spread on top of the grass. It pro­vides com­fort suit­able for a short time,” she said, adding that tak­ing clients to her home — known as “night” — costs them about $10. Al­though coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates are fall­ing and most chil­dren have re­turned to school this month, many women fear they will not be able to re­turn to their old jobs. In­ter­na­tional bor­ders have yet to re­open, forc­ing one for­mer trader, who used to buy kitchen uten­sils and clothes in South Africa for re­sale lo­cally, to keep sell­ing her body to pro­vide for her­self and her child. “Some goods are be­ing il­le­gally im­ported into the coun­try but the bribes that traders pay to the po­lice makes the busi­ness un­prof­itable,” the 26-year-old said one night while wait­ing for men in the back­yard of a closed night­club. “My daugh­ter stays with my mother ... I send money to them ev­ery month.” She hopes to re­turn to her old job when bor­ders re­open in De­cem­ber. But Bhoroma, the econ­o­mist, was scep­ti­cal. “The econ­omy still has chal­lenges in terms of high in­fla­tion, for­eign cur­rency short­ages, high costs of pro­duc­tion and de­pressed lo­cal de­mand,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180612,Read Pres­i­dent’s speech,"Sa­lu­ta­tions. . . ON BE­HALF of the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe and in­deed on my own be­half I would like to ex­tend a spe­cial wel­come to the Gover­nor of Zhe­jiang Province, who is also the party sec­re­tary, who hosted me, and my del­e­ga­tion in Hangzhou, Zhe­jiang Province, dur­ing my visit to China. I also ex­tend a warm wel­come to the busi­ness peo­ple of Zhe­jiang Province and value their visit to Zim­babwe to fur­ther ex­plore busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties in our beau­ti­ful coun­try. My Gov­ern­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to fur­ther strength­en­ing bi­lat­eral tech­ni­cal and eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion un­der the new re­la­tion­ship sta­tus of com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tion and part­ner­ship. In light of this new strate­gic focus, my Gov­ern­ment has put in place ap­pro­pri­ate pol­icy and leg­isla­tive frame­works to im­prove our coun­try’s in­vest­ment cli­mate, lower the cost and risk of do­ing busi­ness and guar­an­tee safety of all for­eign in­vest­ments and pro­tec­tion of prop­erty rights. Dis­tin­guish Del­e­gates; I ap­plaud the in­ten­tions and in­ter­ests shown by the vis­it­ing busi­ness peo­ple from Zhe­jiang Province to in­vest in Zim­babwe. Al­low me to, once again, to re­it­er­ate that in­vestors are as­sured of clear, con­sis­tent, co­her­ent and friendly to busi­ness poli­cies for win-win out­comes. To en­hance our busi­ness op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment, the es­tab­lish­ment of the Zim­babwe In­vest­ment and Devel­op­ment Author­ity (ZIDA) is cur­rently un­der­way which will be the one-stop cen­tre for in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion and pro­mo­tion. In the same vein, in our ef­forts to rejuvenate the econ­omy, my Gov­ern­ment has des­ig­nated Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones which are both ge­o­graph­i­cal and com­mod­ity based as a strat­egy to pro­mote For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment with the at­ten­dant in­cen­tives and ben­e­fits. Notably, among these is the des­ig­na­tion of Vic­to­ria Falls as a Tourism and Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Zone, Bu­l­awayo as the In­dus­trial Hub, Harare as the Tech­nol­ogy Zone as well as Kwekwe and Red­cliff, as Iron and Steel Zone. I have since di­rected the re­spon­si­ble min­istries to en­sure the ur­gent gazetting of the com­pre­hen­sive in­cen­tives package which ap­ply within Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones. I note the in­ter­est ex­pressed by one big Chi­nese com­pany (Hua­jian Group) that is in­ter­ested in set­ting up an integrated in­dus­trial zone in Zim­babwe. My Gov­ern­ment is ready to fa­cil­i­tate the devel­op­ment of this zone un­der the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones frame­work. I, there­fore, urge all lo­cal in­dus­tri­al­ists to seek strate­gic eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and part­ner­ships with their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts for mu­tual ben­e­fit as we seek to leapfrog eco­nomic devel­op­ment and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion of our coun­try. Ladies and Gen­tle­men; Zim­babwe has huge in­vest­ment po­ten­tial and vast op­por­tu­ni­ties in all sec­tors. We wel­come in­vest­ments in the en­tire min­ing value chain from ex­plo­ration and min­ing, to value ad­di­tion, ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and mar­ket­ing. In the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, our thrust is to mech­a­nise and mod­ernise the en­tire agro-value chain. In­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties are equally abound in the con­struc­tion of wa­ter bod­ies, ir­ri­ga­tion devel­op­ment and agri­cul­ture engi­neer­ing; the man­u­fac­tur­ing of fer­tilis­ers, chem­i­cals and her­bi­cides, value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of agri­cul­tural prod­ucts, agri­cul­tural fi­nanc­ing, agro-ICT so­lu­tions and other as­pects of the tech-rev­o­lu­tion that will vault our agri­cul­ture pro­duc­tiv­ity in line with global trends. Let me as­sure you that my Gov­ern­ment will fa­cil­i­tate the im­ple­men­ta­tion of all planned ven­tures and in­vest­ments in the short­est pos­si­ble time. We look for­ward to mas­sive in­vest­ment projects by Chi­nese com­pa­nies, that will see Zim­babwe on the road to ful­fill­ing its vi­sion of be­com­ing a middle in­come coun­try with a per capita in­come of USD3 500, in­creased in­vest­ment, de­cent jobs, broad- based em­pow­er­ment, free from poverty and cor­rup­tion by 2030. Dis­tin­guished del­e­gates; Zim­babwe oc­cu­pies a strate­gic cen­tral lo­ca­tion in South­ern Africa for re­gion­ally tar­geted in­vest­ment with Zim­babwe as the hub for such in­vest­ments. It is the gate­way to the COMESA and SADC mar­kets which res­onates with my coun­ter­part, His Ex­cel­lency, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s vi­sion, un­der the Belt Road Ini­tia­tive. In this re­gard, I ex­hort all prospec­tive lo­cal and for­eign in­vestors to take ad­van­tage of this strate­gic lo­ca­tion by de­vel­op­ing a com­pre­hen­sive net­work of rail, road, air and ICT in­fra­struc­ture. My Gov­ern­ment fur­ther in­vites in­vest­ment in en­ergy, wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion in­fra­struc­ture and other key eco­nomic en­ablers. In­vest­ment in these ar­eas will be ben­e­fi­cial, not only to Zim­babwe, but will equally con­trib­ute to­wards the quest for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, re­gional integration and global connectivity. In­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties are also abound in our man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors which are in dire need of re­tool­ing and mod­erni­sa­tion.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20141219,The long road from Lima to a global cli­mate deal,"Con­fer­ence leaves hopes alive but many ques­tions still unan­swered Just weeks after Pres­i­dents Barack Obama and Xi Jin­ping breathed un­ex­pected life back into the Paris cli­mate change talks, un­veil­ing a bi­lat­eral pact on re­duc­ing emis­sions, another slightly fain­ter puff has come from the di­rec­tion of Lima. True, given the mu­tual back­slap­ping among the 194 coun­tries that gath­ered in Peru to pave the way for next year’s land­mark French sum­mit, one might be for­given for think­ing they had just achieved a huge break­through. That would, of course, be too much to hope for. But they have at least con­cocted some­thing of value in light of the low ex­pec­ta­tions that have dogged in­ter­na­tional cli­mate dis­cus­sions ever since the de­ba­cle at Copen­hagen in 2009: they have agreed not to dis­agree. The com­mu­nique inked in Lima may be more of a road map than a call to ac­tion. It puts off plenty of hard de­ci­sions and dodges some al­to­gether. But the deal drives for­ward the prepa­ra­tions for the Paris sum­mit, which will be the big­gest op­por­tu­nity the world has had for some years to reach a com­pre­hen­sive deal on cli­mate change. The big­gest step taken in South Amer­ica was that all the par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries agreed to sub­mit na­tional plans for curb­ing car­bon emis­sions by the end of March. Th­ese doc­u­ments should set out fig­ures for base emis­sions and an­nual tar­gets. It may not sound like much. After all, there is no com­pul­sion to do much more than gen­er­ate some num­bers, nor are their pro­vi­sions even set for reg­u­lar re­view. Nonethe­less, the deal starts the process of putting most of the world’s coun­tries on the spot for the first time. Their com­mit­ments will not just be filed away in some dusty cab­i­net in Bonn, home of the UN cli­mate change sec­re­tariat. They will be pub­lished by the or­gan­i­sa­tion, along with an as­sess­ment of whether their cu­mu­la­tive ef­fect is suf­fi­cient to meet the UN’s ob­jec­tive of lim­it­ing fu­ture tem­per­a­ture rises to no more than 2 per cent. A sec­ond plus is that the deal blurs for the first time an out­dated con­ven­tion un­der which the world is split into rich and poor coun­tries - with the rich (in prac­tice almost ex­clu­sively Euro­peans) obliged to lead the way. Po­lit­i­cally and prac­ti­cally, it is es­sen­tial for non-Euro­pean states to be­gin meet­ing their share of the bur­den. The rel­a­tive poverty of emerg­ing economies does not ab­solve them of re­spon­si­bil­ity, es­pe­cially not fast-grow­ing coun­tries such as In­dia and China. This is cer­tainly the case for the lat­ter, which now has per capita green­house gas emis­sions that are higher than the EU. Lima leaves plenty of ques­tions unan­swered. The big­gest is how the bur­den of cut­ting emis­sions should be shared. The draft text talks about na­tions hav­ing “common and dif­fer­en­ti­ated” re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and prom­ises that cuts will re- spect “dif­fer­ent na­tional cir­cum­stances”. For such a crit­i­cal is­sue, this is wor­ry­ingly vague. Another miss­ing piece of the jig­saw con­cerns the fi­nan­cial con­tri­bu­tion the ad­vanced economies will make to the cost of what­ever emis­sions the rest of the world agrees to forgo. While the breezy talk at Lima was about them set­ting aside $100bn per an­num from pri­vate and pub­lic sources, it is nei­ther clear where the money will come from, nor whether there is the po­lit­i­cal will to de­liver the pub­lic com­po­nent. With good­will on all sides, there is still time to pull the de­tails to­gether ahead of the Paris sum­mit. Crit­i­cally, how­ever, the mo­men­tum cre­ated by Lima and the US-China pact must not be lost. That re­quires re­al­ism all round - not least from emerg­ing economies. Un­less coun­tries such as In­dia ac­cept some share of the bur­den, a deal in Paris will re­main beyond reach.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210128,Zim­babwe faces steep chal­lenges to take ad­van­tage of Africa free trade area,"By any mea­sure, Zim­babwe’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has fallen on hard times, dec­i­mated by the eco­nomic crises of the past two decades. The south­ern African coun­try has gone from be­ing among the most highly in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa at in­de­pen­dence in 1980, in fact the sec­ond most de­vel­oped af­ter neigh­bour­ing South Africa, to un­der­go­ing a rapid de­cline and be­com­ing among the poor­est. Its ear­lier growth was un­der­pinned by agri­cul­ture, min­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors that have been most hit by poor gov­ern­ment pol­icy and po­lit­i­cal in­ep­ti­tude. The man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has al­most dis­ap­peared and its po­ten­tial has been largely ig­nored by the au­thor­i­ties. Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy One (NDS1), which was launched in Novem­ber last year, man­u­fac­tur­ing con­tributed 25% to GDP in 1990, but that has now fallen to just 10,6%. The fall of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has been partly blamed on the grow­ing de­mand for cheaper fin­ished prod­ucts, from mostly South Africa and China. But mainly, the sec­tor has suf­fered from gov­er­nance fail­ures that cre­ated po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity, hy­per­in­fla­tion at var­i­ous times over the last two decades which also dec­i­mated con­sumer spend­ing, an un­favourable tax regime, glob­al­i­sa­tion, ob­so­lete ma­chin­ery, rolling power cuts, lack or un­avail­abil­ity of ad­e­quate fund­ing for re­tool­ing among oth­ers. With a shrink­ing do­mes­tic mar­ket and eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals that con­tinue to worsen, there has been little in­cen­tive to re­vive lo­cal in­dus­tries. But the ad­vent of the African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) at the start of the year has changed the ball game, and it is time to re­build the in­dus­trial base to ex­ploit the new op­por­tu­ni­ties it presents. African coun­tries be­gan of­fi­cially trad­ing under the AfCFTA at the start of the new year af­ter months of de­lays caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The trade agree­ment presents a huge bloc that cut across Africa’s 55 economies with a col­lec­tive 1,3 bil­lion con­sumers and a com­bined US$3,4 tril­lion GDP. African lead­ers hope this would help usher in an era of de­vel­op­ment for a con­ti­nent that has seen little of that in re­cent times. It took four years of talks for gov­ern­ments to agree to the AfCFTA which would be head­quar­tered in Ghana. That agree­ment was even­tu­ally reached in March 2019. The free trade area, the largest since the cre­ation of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion in 1994 is an at­tempt by African lead­ers to help un­lock the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic po­ten­tial by boost­ing in­tra-re­gional trade, strength­en­ing sup­ply chains and spread­ing ex­per­tise. It com­pels mem­ber States to re­move tar­iffs from 90% of goods en­ter­ing their mar­kets from the re­gion, al­low­ing free ac­cess to com­modi­ties, goods and ser­vices across the con­ti­nent. For Zim­babwe, AfCFTA should pro­vide the op­por­tu­nity to re­vive its rust­ing in­dus­tries, cre­ate em­ploy­ment and al­low the in­no­va­tive­ness of its pop­u­la­tion to lift the econ­omy out of poverty. The above-men­tioned NDS1 is tar­get­ing to in­crease the con­tri­bu­tion of the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor to GDP from 10,6% to 15% by 2025. It also hopes to ramp up val­ueadded ex­ports from US$727,47 mil­lion last year to US$1,3 bil­lion in 2025. The pol­icy is skewed mainly to­wards re­viv­ing agri­cul­ture, which pro­vides over 60% of raw ma­te­ri­als to in­dus­try. But gov­ern­ment must also spread the op­por­tu­ni­ties to the wider econ­omy and coun­try to ad­dress a dis­turb­ing trend high­lighted by the NDS1. As of 2019, about 46% of Zim­babwe’s man­u­fac­tur­ing firms were lo­cated in Harare as a dif­fi­cult op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment led some com­pa­nies to ei­ther close down or re­lo­cate to the cap­i­tal. AfCFTA presents real op­por­tu­ni­ties, it is up to the gov­ern­ment and in­dus­try to grab them or watch other coun­tries ex­ploit Zim­babwe's ev­i­dent gaps. The coun­try can­not af­ford to re­main a net im­porter given its nat­u­ral en­dow­ments. Among the big­gest con­cerns for the coun­try is its in­abil­ity to at­tract in­vestors who may be seek­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties pre­sented by the free trade area. Sev­eral ques­tions arise: Can lo­cal com­pa­nies re­tool to be­come com­pet­i­tive? Can gov­ern­ment im­prove pol­icy mak­ing to make the coun­try more busi­ness friendly, not only to new in­vest­ment but to en­cour­age ex­ist­ing com­pa­nies to boost present fa­cil­i­ties or set up new ones? How can it im­prove its IT ecosys­tem to en­cour­age youth par­tic­i­pa­tion? Are there lo­gis­tics in place to take lo­cal pro­duce to for­eign mar­kets quickly and on de­mand? Ex­pe­ri­ences over the fes­tive hol­i­days laid bare Zim­babwe’s chal­lenge in re­solv­ing its poor lo­gis­tics at its largest in­land port of en­try, the Beit­bridge Border Post, with truck driv­ers spend­ing days in queues on both sides wait­ing for ser­vice. Beit­bridge is the busiest tran­sit port for cargo from South Africa with des­ti­na­tions in Zim­babwe, Zam­bia, Malawi, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo and of­ten as far as Tan­za­nia. The Beit­bridge-Chirundu Road is a key com­po­nent of the Tran­sAfrican High­way Net­work link­ing South Africa and Zam­bia. It is also part of the North– South Cor­ri­dor Project and the Cape to Cairo Road, and a gate­way to the Com­mon Mar­ket for Eastern and South­ern Africa. There are rel­a­tively few stud­ies on the fi­nan­cial ben­e­fit the cor­ri­dor brings to Zim­babwe but a sit­u­a­tion anal­y­sis car­ried out in 2009 showed that the wait­ing time at the border was about 33 hours for south-bound traf­fic while for north bound traf­fic wait­ing time was about 45 hours. It was es­ti­mated that the cost as­so­ci­ated with this wait­ing time was about US$29,3 mil­lion for south bound and US$35 mil­lion for north bound traf­fic per year. Re­cently, lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies said it was cost­ing them US$300 per truck each day they spend at the border. Zim­babwe has also ne­glected the roads that make up the cor­ri­dor: The Beit­bridge-Harare High­way was built in the 1960s and has far out­lived its 20-year life­span. Af­ter hag­gling over ten­ders since 2003, gov­ern­ment fi­nally started work on the du­al­i­sa­tion of the road last year, with dif­fer­ent com­pa­nies work­ing on parts of the project to ex­pe­dite com­ple­tion, but this may have come too late to save the sit­u­a­tion. The new Kazun­gula Bridge sim­ply by-passes the bot­tle­necks at Beit­bridge, Zim­babwe’s bad roads, its no­to­ri­ously cor­rupt po­lice and links the South African ports to the same mar­kets Zim­babwe is tar­get­ing to ser­vice. The bridge’s open­ing is cer­tainly a boon for the AfCFTA but Zim­babwe has a lot of work to catch up. This story was taken from the Weekly Di­gest, an AMH dig­i­tal pub­li­ca­tion",津巴布韦

Sci­en­tif­i­cally, a lack of com­pre­hen­sive re­search in Zim­babwe has af­fected ar­riv­ing at con­clu­sions that can bol­ster for­mu­la­tion of work­ing le­gal frame­works ahead of the 2030 tar­get to meet Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals (SDGs). Zim­babwe com­mit­ted it­self to im­ple­ment­ing all the 17 SDGs, with spe­cial pri­or­ity given to ten SDGs among them num­ber 13, which ad­dresses cli­mate change is­sues. SDG 13 aims at mak­ing com­mu­ni­ties more re­silient against ex­treme weather con­di­tions to re­duce dam­age and death rates dur­ing weather haz­ards. Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions (UN), SDGs are a “bold, uni­ver­sal agree­ment to end poverty in all its di­men­sions and craft an equal, just and se­cure world — for peo­ple, planet and pros­per­ity by 2030.” Cli­mate change is a change to the state of the cli­mate sys­tem that per­sists over an ex­tended pe­riod of time in ad­di­tion to nat­u­ral cli­mate vari­abil­ity. Hu­man ac­tiv­ity is the pri­mary cause of cli­mate change. Ac­tiv­i­ties such as burn­ing fos­sil fu­els, mi­gra­tion, agri­cul­ture and de­for­esta­tion are also sig­nif­i­cant causes. The In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Panel on Cli­mate Change (IPCC) notes that the ma­jor im­pacts of cli­mate change on hu­man health are likely to oc­cur via changes in the mag­ni­tude and fre­quency of ex­treme events, which trig­ger a nat­u­ral dis­as­ter or emer­gency. Be­cause cli­mate change is ex­plained in sci­en­tific terms, de­spite hav­ing cli­mate change strate­gies, Zim­babwe’s gov­ern­ment and law­mak­ers have failed to come up with a sci­en­tific ev­i­dence-based cli­mate change pol­icy. Ac­cord­ing to Ro­drick Moyo from the Zim­babwe En­vi­ron­men­tal Lawyers As­so­ci­a­tion (ZELA), Zim­babwe does not have a cli­mate change law be­sides poli­cies and strate­gies. Zim­babwe cur­rently uses the En­ergy Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity Act (Chap­ter 13:23), the En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment Act, Elec­tric­ity Act and the Forest Act. There are sev­eral other poli­cies and strate­gies used among them the Na­tional En­vi­ron­men­tal Pol­icy, Re­new­able En­ergy Pol­icy. Strate­gies in­clude, the Na­tional Cli­mate Change Re­sponse Strat­egy and the Long-term Low Green­house Gas Emis­sion Devel­op­ment Strat­egy (2020 to 2050) among oth­ers “Cli­mate change is main­streamed in bits and pieces in a num­ber of leg­is­la­tion. This needs to be con­sol­i­dated so that our ap­proach is timely. En­vi­ron­men­tal Rights are in­cluded in the 2013 Con­sti­tu­tion which sets a foun­da­tion for craft­ing laws ad­dress­ing cli­mate change. “Our poli­cies and strate­gies show that our coun­try is mak­ing com­mit­ments to­wards ad­dress­ing cli­mate and cre­at­ing a cli­mate re­silient coun­try. “How­ever, go­ing for­ward we have to de­velop a com­pre­hen­sive leg­isla­tive frame­work in or­der to deal with cli­mate change in a more struc­tural way. “The risk is, with­out a cli­mate change leg­is­la­tion we may not be able to deal with the detri­men­tal ef­fects of cli­mate change and his­tory is there to re­mind us as we have per­formed dis­mally,” said Moyo. Ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics, 97 per­cent of cli­mate sci­en­tists to­day agree that cli­mate change is real and hu­mans are the cat­a­lysts to this phe­nom­e­non. In­di­ca­tions from cli­mate ex­perts are that the global tem­per­a­ture has been on the rise on av­er­age by 0,85 de­grees Cel­sius since 1880. “It may sound like a small change, but with­out ur­gent ac­tions to re­duce the car­bon emis­sions, global tem­per­a­ture is go­ing to rise six de­grees Cel­sius by the end of the cen­tury,” writes cli­mate sus­tain­abil­ity ex­pert Ti­mothy Yen. The ef­fects of cli­mate change are al­ready be­ing felt, and Zim­babwe is no ex­cep­tion. Cy­clones, floods, heavy rains, droughts and strong winds have been im­mense char­ac­ter­is­tics since 2000. The ef­fects of such re­main fresh con­sid­er­ing the dam­age, dis­place­ment and death caused by Cy­clones Eline, Dineo and Idai and re­cently trop­i­cal de­pres­sion Cha­lane. Devel­op­ment ini­tia­tives in more eco­nom­i­cally de­vel­oped coun­tries (MEDCs) have con­trib­uted to global warm­ing at a faster rate than de­vel­op­ments in less eco­nom­i­cally de­vel­oped coun­tries (LEDCs) like Zim­babwe. Grand an­nounce­ments like the 2015 Paris Agree­ment have also done lit­tle to help LEDCs in evenly and equally fight­ing cli­mate change, but given room to de­vel­oped na­tions se­cure their en­vi­ron­ment. Since 2016, the Paris Agree­ment has been com­mit­ting one tril­lion dol­lars yearly fight­ing cli­mate change. Since the USA pulled out of the agree­ment, China has been lead­ing in re­duc­ing emis­sions (since it is the big­gest pol­luter) and in­creased its use of clean en­ergy. Ac­cord­ing to the US De­part­ment of En­ergy’s In­ter­na­tional En­ergy re­port, Africa each year pro­duces an av­er­age of just over one met­ric tonne of the green­house gas car­bon diox­ide per per­son. This trans­lates that the con­ti­nent con­trib­utes the least of any con­ti­nent to global warm­ing. “What LEDCs need to do now is unite and de­mand help from MEDCs since the in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries are re­spon­si­ble for emit­ting much of the gases lead­ing to global warm­ing. “De­vel­oped coun­tries must give fi­nan­cial as well as ma­te­rial and tech­no­log­i­cal help to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in or­der for them to ef­fec­tively deal with cli­mate change in pol­icy as well as devel­op­ment is­sues at na­tional to grass­roots level,” said Par­don Maguta, an en­vi­ron­men­tal and cli­mate change agenda activist. Maguta noted that cli­mate change is not only re­stricted to droughts and cy­clones, but “heat-waves, ex­treme cold re­sult­ing from tem­per­a­ture drops and en­ergy” among other is­sues. Sim­i­lar sen­ti­ments are also shared by Moyo who high­lights that the is­sue of clean en­ergy is also key in deal­ing with cli­mate change, op­posed to use of fos­sils. “It is a tight sit­u­a­tion for Africa and Zim­babwe whose en­ergy solely de­pends on coal power sta­tions. “In the near fu­ture it could be more dire con­sid­er­ing that most ma­jor fun­ders have de­clared their in­ten­tions of stop­ping to fund coal pow­ered sta­tions. “We there­fore risk hav­ing stranded as­sets. “A coun­try like Zim­babwe which al­most solely de­pends on for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment is doomed con­sid­er­ing that even do­mes­tic re­source mo­bil­i­sa­tion could be a chal­lenge,” Moyo added. There is nowhere the need to achieve SDGs tar­gets so para­mount than in Africa. The im­ple­men­ta­tion of the SDGs is un­even, and for SDG 13, our gen­er­at­ing cli­mate sys­tem shows how it threat­ens ir­re­versible con­se­quences if the gov­ern­ment does not act. Cli­mate change im­pacts spare no coun­try but strike un­equally MEDCs and LEDCs, rais­ing the ques­tion how Zim­babwe and other African coun­tries are equipped to re­spond to these chal­lenges.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160907,In­dia’s Smart strat­egy: A role model for Sadc?,"IN 2013, In­dia en­tered into its 12th Five-Year Plan. The 12th Five-Year Plan has been ded­i­cated to “faster, sus­tain­able and more in­clu­sive growth”. This 12th Plan came on the back of an 11th Plan themed “faster and more in­clu­sive growth”. The 11th Plan had set mea­sur­able tar­gets re­lated to Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals. The Gov­ern­ment tar­geted six ac­tion­able cat­e­gories: i. In­come and Poverty; ii. Ed­u­ca­tion; iii. Health; iv. Women and Chil­dren; v. In­fra­struc­ture and vi. The En­vi­ron­ment Un­der the um­brella of these ma­jor cat­e­gories, the Gov­ern­ment listed 27 tar­gets. Dr Nagesh Singh, an ad­vi­sor to the Plan­ning Com­mis­sion, Gov­ern­ment of In­dia, re­views the five-year 11th Plan in re­la­tion to Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals (MDG) and finds that de­spite In­dia’s im­pres­sive eco­nomic growth, the growth has not been in­clu­sive. The gov­ern­ment of In­dia was for ex­am­ple, on course to achieve MDG 2 of uni­ver­sal pri­mary ed­u­ca­tion dur­ing the 20072012 pe­ri­ods, but fell short on most of the health re­lated de­vel­op­ment goals. None­the­less there are lessons to be learnt from In­dia’s Plan­ning Com­mis­sion. After all, In­dia did grow at an av­er­age of 8 per­cent dur­ing the pe­riod. Fur­ther­more, this growth spread to cru­cial sec­tors such as agri­cul­ture. To achieve such im­pres­sive growth, the Gov­ern­ment es­tab­lished a clear vi­sion that was bro­ken down into ac­tion­able ob­jec­tives. In­deed, in the 12th Plan, that is the modus operandi of the Plan­ning Com­mis­sion of In­dia. The Gov­ern­ment’s multi-di­men­sional ob­jec­tives are re­flected in 25 mon­i­torable tar­gets. This ap­proach to plan­ning by the Com­mis­sion is sim­i­lar to that of the SMART method of set­ting ob­jec­tives. The mnemonic acro­nym de­vel­oped for man­age­ment states that ob­jec­tives should be spe­cific, mea­sur­able, achiev­able, re­al­is­tic and time-bound. Such an ap­proach im­proves the chances of suc­cess of projects and ap­pears to be ap­pro­pri­ate even on a macroe­co­nomic scale. The process of fix­ing the 12th Plan tar­gets and defin­ing plan strate­gies was a con­sul­ta­tive one. The Gov­ern­ment of In­dia en­gaged amongst others, Min­istries, economists, so­ci­ol­o­gists and sec­tor ex­perts. The plan is split into three vol­umes; vol­ume I pro­vides a gen­eral over­view, vol­ume II looks at key eco­nomic sec­tors and vol­ume III iden­ti­fies vi­tal so­cial sec­tors. In vol­ume II, pri­or­ity eco­nomic sec­tors in­clude, among others, agri­cul­ture, in­dus­try, en­ergy, trans­port, and com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Agri­cul­ture, which ac­counted for an es­ti­mated 14 per­cent of In­dia’s GDP in 2012, is pri­ori­tised be­cause it pro­vides the “main source of in­come for In­dia’s ru­ral pop­u­la­tion” and is there­fore crit­i­cal to in­clu­sive­ness, ac­cord­ing to the plan. In the 12th Plan, In­dia tar­gets 4 per­cent growth in this sec­tor. Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion to­wards higher value crops and live­stock, credit and mar­ket ac­cess as well as mech­a­ni­sa­tion are some of the iden­ti­fied driv­ers of growth for the small­holder farm­ers who typ­ify the In­dian agri­cul­tural land­scape. The plan pro­gresses from an anal­y­sis of agri­cul­ture to in­dus­try. Man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­counts for around 16 per­cent of In­dia’s GDP. This fig­ure, to­gether with the fact that growth has stag­nated in the sec­tor, is of con­cern to the In­dian Gov­ern­ment. The Plan­ning Com­mis­sion states that “un­less man­u­fac­tur­ing be­comes an en­gine of growth, pro­vid­ing at least 70 mil­lion ad­di­tional jobs, it will be dif­fi­cult for In­dia’s growth to be in­clu­sive”. The Gov­ern­ment’s con­cern is height­ened by a com­par­i­son of its sec­tor/GDP ra­tio to that of other emerg­ing economies. China and Thai­land have ra­tios of over 30 per­cent. To drive in­dus­try, In­dia is look­ing to de­velop hu­man re­sources, re­form the busi­ness reg­u­la­tory frame­work, en­sure en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity within in­dus­try by main- stream­ing green busi­ness, ac­cel­er­ate ex­ports by build­ing a brand image and cre­at­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing zones. In vol­ume III so­cial sec­tors such as health and ed­u­ca­tion are out­lined. The 12th Plan is In­dia’s first step to­wards uni­ver­sal health care (UHC) to be fi­nanced by tax rev­enues and sup­ple­mented by part­ner­ships with the pri­vate sec­tor. Within the Plan sin taxes are pro­posed by the Com­mis­sion. The Plan also states out­come in­di­ca­tors for the process, for ex­am­ple, re­duc­ing the in­fant mor­tal­ity rate (IMR) to 25 by 2017. The IMR at the end of the 11th Plan was 44 out of a thou­sand in­fants be­low 12 months old. The afore­men­tioned steps the Gov­ern­ment plans to take within and across sec­tors dur­ing the five-year phase demon­strate what is re­quired to man­age in­clu­sive growth and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. The In­dian case lends it­self to Africa. The eco­nomic and so­cial sec­tors the coun­try is try­ing to up­lift are iden­ti­cal to those most African na­tions need to con­cen­trate on. For this rea­son, In­dia’s pro­gres­sion through the 12th phase will be in­ter­est­ing to ob­serve and learn from. In a rapidly in­te­grat­ing and in­creas­ingly in­ter­con­nected world, African plan­ners need not only to look to the East but to the rest of the world for op­por­tu­ni­ties, syn­ergy and role mod­els. Europe’s “2020 Strat­egy for Smart, Sus­tain­able, and In­clu­sive Growth” is thus worth not­ing. The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion is pur­su­ing smart growth which con­sists of be­com­ing a dig­i­tal so­ci­ety and an in­no­va­tion union with bet­ter qual­ity higher ed­u­ca­tion. In or­der to be sus­tain­able, Europe plans to be re­source ef­fi­cient and im­ple­ment in­dus­trial pol­icy for green growth. For growth to be in­clu­sive, new skills and jobs and a fight against poverty are en­vi­sioned ini­tia­tives. Be­fore work­ing to­wards Strat­egy 2020, the Com­mis­sion iden­ti­fies fi­nan­cial sec­tor re­form and bud­getary con­sol­i­da­tion as nec­es­sary to form a ba­sis for Strat­egy 2020. A SADC with a learn­ing mind­set can de­ploy the above two strate­gic thrusts si­mul­ta­ne­ously. If a com­mon cur­rency and bud­getary con­sol­i­da­tion are good for Europe, and have been so for the USA, China and In­dia, they should be bet­ter for SADC. The chal­lenge is for strat­egy to be “SMART” and re­source ef­fi­cient.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20151129,Pres­i­dent Xi to sign co­op­er­a­tion deals:,"CHI­NESE Pres­i­dent Mr Xi Jin­ping ar­rives in Zim­babwe on Tues­day on a two- day state visit amid expectations that the high pro­file visit - the first of its kind by the Asian tiger’s sit­ting pres­i­dent - will see a num­ber of co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments be­ing signed in crit­i­cal sec­tors such as wa­ter, en­ergy and in­fra­struc­ture. A high-pow­ered team of Chi­nese busi­ness­peo­ple is also part of the del­e­ga­tion and are ex­pected to ex­change notes with their lo­cal coun­ter­parts as they ex­plore pos­si­bil­i­ties of joint ven­tures. There are also in­di­ca­tions that Pres­i­dent Xi’s visit will re­sult in an ac­cel­er­ated im­ple­men­ta­tion of at least nine mega deals worth bil­lions of dol­lars signed be­tween the two coun­tries in Au­gust last year. The Zim­bab­wean del­e­ga­tion led by Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe, signed nine land­mark agree­ments that will see China pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial sup­port to the eco­nomic en­ablers in crit­i­cal sec­tors such as roads, na­tional rail­way net­works, en­ergy, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, agri­cul­ture and tourism. All the projects dove­tail with the as­pi­ra­tions of the coun­try’s eco­nomic blueprint, the Zim­babwe Agenda for Sus­tain­able So­cio-Eco­nomic Trans­for­ma­tion (Zim-As­set), which has four key pil­lars in­clud­ing in­fra­struc­ture and util­i­ties, food se­cu­rity and nu­tri­tion, so­cial ser­vices and poverty erad­i­ca­tion and value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. Last week, the Sec­re­tary for For­eign Af­fairs, Am­bas­sador Joey Bimha con­firmed to The Sun­day Mail Busi­ness that nu­mer­ous agree­ments will be signed in var­i­ous sec­tors of the econ­omy. Am­bas­sador Bimha said the agree­ments will en­hance co­op­er­a­tion be­tween Zim­babwe and the world’s sec­ond largest econ­omy. “There is go­ing to be sign­ing of agree­ments of co­op­er­a­tion in a num­ber of sec­tors; in the en­ergy sec­tor, wa­ter sec­tor and in­fra­struc­ture. “Th­ese are the agree­ments that will be signed to en­hance our co­op­er­a­tion with China,” said Am­bas­sador Bimha. He added that Pres­i­dent Xi’s visit was im­por­tant given China’s in­flu­ence in the world econ­omy and that it is a coun­try “we co­op­er­ate with well”. “So his visit is a re­flec­tion of co­op­er­a­tion be­tween our two coun­tries. The agree­ments that are go­ing to be signed will in­crease co­op­er­a­tion be­tween our two coun­tries. “There are also busi­ness­peo­ple in the del­e­ga­tion, so we are hop­ing that we will have high in­ter­ac­tion be­tween our busi­ness­peo­ple (and the Chi­nese) which might speak to more Chi­nese in­vest­ment or joint ven­tures and busi­ness ben­e­fits to Zim­babwe,” said Am­bas­sador Bimha. Pres­i­dent Xi’s visit comes ahead of the Fo­rum on China-Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (Focac) pen­ciled for De­cem­ber 4-5 in Johannesburg, South Africa, where the emerg­ing global gi­ant is ex­pected to an­nounce the pack­age of co­op­er­a­tion pro­pos­als. The Asian coun­try’s Vice Commerce, Min­is­ter Mr Qian Kem­ing told jour­nal­ists in Beijing last Thurs­day that the pack­age will see China help­ing African coun­tries to up­grade in­dus­trial struc­ture, safe­guard food se­cu­rity and build in­fra­struc­ture. “To that end, China will give African coun­tries more low-in­ter­est loans and set up funds to fi­nance the co­op­er­a­tion,” said Mr Kem­ing. He added that there are plans to in­crease in­vest­ment in Africa and buy more non-re­sources prod­ucts from the con­ti­nent, on the back of fall­ing metal prices. China plans to ex­port ad­vanced in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity to African coun­tries as it seeks to main­tain its stran­gle­hold on the con­ti­nent that had suf­fered for a long time un­der ex­ploita­tive trade agree­ments with Europe and the United States. Beijing also seeks to di­ver­sify im­ports from the con­ti­nent and buy more prod­ucts in ad­di­tion to pri­mary com­modi­ties, par­tic­u­larly nat­u­ral re­sources, which ac­count for the bulk of China-Africa trade. The Asian tiger has be­come Harare’s big­gest trade part­ner with trade sta­tis­tics be­tween the two coun­tries peak­ing to nearly US$1,2 bil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and Novem­ber last year com­pared to US$1,1 bil­lion for t he whole of 2013. In the first five months of 2015, stat i st ics from t he Zim­babwe In­vest­ment Author­ity (ZIA) showed that Beijing re­mained Harare’s largest i nve s tor ac­count­ing for 74 per­cent of the US$134 mil­lion of the for­eign direct in­vest­ments that came into the coun­try. Be­tween Jan­uary and Septem­ber 2015 this year, ZIA ap­proved FDI ( in­clud­ing joint ven­tures) com­ing from China worth US$153,561,602. The ap­proved FDI in agri­cul­ture was US$1,5 mil­lion while con­struc­tion recorded US$42,3 mil­lion, with US$64,9 mil­lion go­ing to the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, US$41 mil­lion to min­ing, US$3,3 mil­lion for ser­vices and US$400 000 ben­e­fit­ing the trans­port sec­tor. Last week, ZIA board chair­man, Dr Nigel Chanakira also told The Sun­day Mail Busi­ness that the com­ing of Pres­i­dent Xi un­der­scores the point that Zim­babwe re­mains an at­trac­tive in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion. “The visit by Pres­i­dent Xi has been con­tem­plated for quite a long time and quite a num­ber of peo­ple have cast as­per­sions on whether he was go­ing to come or not given the sit­u­a­tion. So for me it is fur­ther con­fir­ma­tion that as an in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion, Zim­babwe re­mains at­trac­tive,” said Dr Chanakira. He added that China has “a very State-ori­ented ap­proach in terms of in­vest­ment plan­ning”. “That is how the Chi­nese work, they nor­mally work State-to-State. In this par­tic­u­lar case, there has been a num­ber of vis­its (to China) on the part of our Pres­i­dency. “For ex­am­ple in terms of Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones (SEZs), there has been a lot of spe­cific work done and the for­mer Am­bas­sadors, you re­call, made as­sis­tance in terms of study tours to China so that we will model and mimic what the Chi­nese have done be­cause that is the way they op­er­ate and they like a sim­i­lar op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment. “A lot of peo­ple have then seen quite a sig­nif­i­cant amount of project sign-ups and they have been ask­ing if th­ese projects will come to fruition. “China has been in our top three sources of in­vest­ments since we dol­larised. If you note the work of the res­i­dent Am­bas­sador here and our em­bassy in China, th­ese are what we would call the busiest em­bassies in terms of definitely li­ais­ing with ZIA with re­gards to spe­cific projects and co­or­di­nat­ing in­vest­ment ap­provals. The num­bers don’t lie.” A num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies have al­ready in­vested in Zim­babwe while oth­ers have opted for part­ner­ships with lo­cal com­pa­nies. Sino Hy­dro Cor­po­ra­tion, for in­stance, has part­nered the Zim­babwe Power Com­pany (ZPC) in the ex­pan­sion of Kariba South Hy­dro Power Sta­tion in a US$533 mil­lion project, which upon com­ple­tion in 2017, will in­crease power gen­er­a­tion at Kariba by an­other 300 megawatts (MW). Sino Hy­dro is also ex­pand­ing Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion in a US$1,3 bil­lion project that will add 600MW to the na­tional grid. Coun­tries vis­ited by the Chi­nese top po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship have tended to get more in­vest­ments and it is ex­pected that Zim­babwe will equally ben­e­fit. Sta­tis­tics also show that China has been con­sis­tently dou­bling its fi­nanc­ing com­mit­ment to Africa in the last three Focac meet­ings from US$5 bil­lion in 2006 to US$10 bil­lion in 2009 and US$20 bil­lion in 2012. In April this year, Equa­to­rial Guinea signed sev­eral agree­ments with Chi­nese com­pa­nies to in­crease gen­er­a­tion of elec­tric­ity and de­velop its in­dus­trial sec­tor, a key goal of the gov­ern­ment’s plan to di­ver­sify its econ­omy and re­duce de­pen­dence on oil pro­duc­tion. The largest was a US$2 bil­lion agree­ment with the In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China (ICBC), China’s big­gest lender by as­sets, to pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port to the Mal­abo gov­ern­ment and Chi­nese busi­nesses op­er­at­ing in the coun­try. The agree­ment was signed on April 30 fol­low­ing a meet­ing held in Beijing be­tween Equa­to­rial Guinea Pres­i­dent Theodore Obiang Nguema Mba­sogo and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part, Pres­i­dent Xi. Apart from for­mer Premier Zhou En­lai’s ide­ol­ogy- tinged vis­its to Africa in the 1960s, past Chi­nese pres­i­dents rarely trav­elled to Africa un­til re­cently when in­vest­ment on the con­ti­nent be­came high on the coun­try’s agenda. For­mer pres­i­dent Hu Jin­tao vis­ited Africa six times be­tween 1999 and 2009. In Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary 1999 when he was Vice Pres­i­dent, Mr Hu first vis­ited Mada­gas­car, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and South Africa and af­ter two years, he vis­ited Uganda. In 2004 when he be­came pres­i­dent, he vis­ited Egypt, Gabon and Al­ge­ria. Records show that it is rare for both the Chi­nese Pres­i­dent and Prime Min­is­ter to visit the same re­gion in the same year but for­mer Pres­i­dent Hu and Premier Wen Ji­abao separately vis­ited Africa in April and June, cov­er­ing 10 coun­tries. Prime Min­is­ter Wen vis­ited Ghana, Egypt, the Repub­lic of Congo, An­gola, South Africa, Tan­za­nia and Uganda. In his first over­seas visit in 2007, for­mer Pres­i­dent Hu vis­ited eight coun­tries in Africa - Cameroon, Su­dan, Mozam­bique, Namibia, Sey­chelles, Liberia, Zam­bia and South Africa. In all the coun­tries he vis­ited, Mr Hu an­nounced new aid and in­vest­ment pro­grams. There have been al­le­ga­tions that China is only in­ter­ested in re­sourcerich African coun­tries but in Fe­bru­ary 2009, Mr Hu vis­ited Mali, Sene­gal, Tan­za­nia and Mau­ri­tius that are nei­ther rich in re­sources nor oil pro­duc­tion. In­stead, China helped build schools, hos­pi­tals and other in­fra­struc­ture projects in the coun­tries vis­ited. Mr Hu’s pre­de­ces­sor Mr Jiang Zemin also vis­ited three African coun­tries in 2002 - Nige­ria, Libya and Tu­nisia while in 2004, Vice Pres­i­dent Zeng Qinghong trav­elled to Tu­nisia, Togo, Benin and South Africa. In 2004 around the time when Zim­babwe vig­or­ously started pur­su­ing the ‘Look East Pol­icy’, Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress chair­man Mr Wu Bang­guo vis­ited Kenya, Zim­babwe, Zam­bia and Nige­ria. It has also be­come al­most a New Year rit­ual for the Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter to be­gin his an­nual over­seas vis­its in Africa since the early 1990s. While for­mer colonis­ers treated Africa in a con­de­scend­ing way, China con­sid­ers it­self part of the de­vel­op­ing world and for­mer Pres­i­dent Hu said the part­ner­ship was based on “po­lit­i­cal equal­ity and mu­tual trust”. When he vis­ited South Africa in 2007, Mr Hu said “China did not, does not, and will not im­pose its will or in­equal­ity on other coun­tries, as well as do any­thing that would harm the African peo­ple”. Since 2000, the United States trade re­la­tions with Africa have been dic­tated by the Africa Growth and Op­por­tu­nity Act (AGOA). As a uni­lat­eral pref­er­ence scheme of the United States to pro­mote trade and in­vest­ment in Africa, AGOA was meant to boost Amer­ica’s trade with Africa and de­velop the con­ti­nent. But by last year, United States trade in goods with Africa has demon­strated a shock­ing down­ward trend since 2011, dwin­dling from US$125 bil­lion in 2011 to US$99 bil­lion in 2012 and US$85 bil­lion in 2013. Last year, trade in goods be­tween the United States and Africa was US$50 bil­lion. In com­par­i­son, Beijing has been quite low-key in dis­sem­i­nat­ing its Africa trade pro­mo­tion ef­forts, al­though its trade with Africa has been grow­ing ex­po­nen­tially. China sur­passed the United States as Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner in 2009. China-Africa trade reached US$166 bil­lion in 2011, an 83 per­cent rise from 2009. The bi lat­eral trade fur ther in­creased an­other 19,3 per­cent to US$198 bil­lion in 2012, and passed the US$200 bil­lion thresh­old to US$210 bil­lion in 2013. In terms of trade vol­ume, Chi­nese trade with Africa not only dwarfs United States’ trade with Africa, but the gap is as large as 2,5 times the mag­ni­tude of 2013. Be­tween Jan­uary and Novem­ber last year, China-Africa trade to­talled US$201.1 bil­lion, go­ing up 5,4 per­cent year on year, with its an­nual trade hit­ting US$200 bil­lion once again. Among oth­ers, China’s ex­port to Africa saw a ro­bust growth, up 13.2 per­cent year on year, 8.3 per­cent higher than China’s ex­port growth over the same pe­riod. In re­cent years, Africa has be­come an emerg­ing des­ti­na­tion of China’s out­bound in­vest­ment. In Jan­uary-Novem­ber 2014, Chi­nese en­ter­prises made a non-fi­nan­cial direct in­vest­ment of US$3,5 bil­lion in Africa, up 19 per­cent year on year. More than 2 500 Chi­nese en­ter­prises did busi­ness in Africa, and it cov­ered var­i­ous ar­eas in­clud­ing fi­nance, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, en­ergy, man­u­fac­tur­ing and agri­cul­ture, cre- at­ing more than 100,000 jobs di­rectly for lo­cal peo­ple. How­ever, Chi­nese in­vest­ments to Africa had fallen by 40 per­cent in the first half of this year, with an­a­lysts say­ing the sharp de­cline was a sign of the broader im­pact of the coun­try’s slow­ing econ­omy while oth­ers posit that the de­cline is more re­lated to Beijing’s chang­ing ap­proach to in­vest­ments over­seas. Pres­i­dent Xi is ex­pected to clear up whether Beijing’s over­seas in­vest­ment strat­egy is chang­ing when he speaks at the Focac in Johannesburg this week.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160721,Rolling back the Sa­hara: Lessons from China,"WHILE I do not want to sound like an alarmist, the truth is that the Sa­hara Desert is ex­pand­ing south- wards. It does not mat­ter how slow, but the arid swathe of land is ex­pected to, even­tu­ally af­ter some years, show it­self up at the shores of some coun­tries south of the Sa­hara. Some scientists ac­tu­ally say the signs that the desert is mov­ing fast down­wards will be­gin to clearly show as early as 2025. To think this is only nine years from now must be enough to cause trep­i­da­tion. In fact, the scientists say if the trend con­tin­ues un­abated, the whole of Africa will turn into a desert one day. Sounds too far-fetched? Well, those who study the his­tory of deserts and de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion think this is quite a pos- sibil­ity. As the ef­fects of cli­mate change con­tinue to hit hard due to in­creas­ing global warm­ing, it is time for more ac­tion to com­bat the spread of the Sa­hara. And African coun­tries can learn a lot from how China is com­bat­ing the spread of its own deserts in simple, but ef­fec­tive ways. Like Africa, China’s arable land is threat­ened by deserts in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try. What is more fright­en­ing is that not only are arable lands un­der threat from this scourge, cities, which took long to es­tab­lish, also face a huge men­ace from the deserts. Al­ready, sand storms, com­monly re­ferred to as “yel­low dust”, are a huge scare in China, of­ten af­fect­ing big cities such as the cap­i­tal Bei­jing. What is im­por­tant is that China is not sit­ting on its hands. A big bat­tle is go­ing on in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try to com­bat the spread of deserts and stop con­tin­ued de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion. One of the out­stand­ing ex­am­ples of suc­cess­fully fight­ing the spread of a desert is in the Ningxia Hui Au­ton­o­mous Re­gion. Lo­cated in the north-west part of China, of­fi­cials in Ningxia have es­tab­lished the Bai­ji­tan De­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion Con­trol For­est Farm, also known as the Lingwu Bai­ji­tan Na­tional Na­ture Re­serve. A re­cent visit I had to this area re­vealed how peo­ple in Ningxia have taken it upon them­selves to push the Maowusu Desert back be­fore it pushes them out of their hab­it­able ar­eas. The project lo­cated at the edge of the desert mea­sures 61 kilo­me­tres long from the north to west and 21km wide from east to west. It was the re­al­i­sa­tion that if left alone, the desert would swal­low up farm­land and sti­fle the am­bi­tions to ex­pand in­dus­try that made au­thor­i­ties in this area take a step fur­ther to phys­i­cally stop the desert. An in­ter­ac­tion with of­fi­cials in Ningxia re­vealed that the re­gion is very poor by Chi­nese stan­dards, but there are huge de­vel­op­ment plans in the pipeline to up­lift its sta­tus. For an ef­fec­tive war against the desert, of­fi­cials des­ig­nated the arid re­gion as the ma­jor stum­bling block to their de­vel­op­men­tal am­bi­tions. Al­though the anti-de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion project has been go­ing on for some time, it has been ex­panded in re­cent years as cli­mate change con­tin­ues to bite. The method of con­trol­ling the ex­pan­sion of the desert is simple but labour in­ten­sive. It in­volves making grids out of grass (in form squares of laid grass straws wedged into the sand in which a tree is planted at the cen­tre). The grids in­crease the rough­ness of the sur­face and cur­tail wind force, while at the same time con­serv­ing wa­ter and in­creas­ing wa­ter con­tent on the sand. The ef­fect of such grass grids is a marvel to watch as they have fixed mi­gra­tory sand dunes and trans­formed them into oases by eas­ily re­tain­ing wa­ter. Scientists have ap­plauded this simple method as a double-edged bar­rel to fight deserts, in­volv­ing both af­foresta­tion and sup­pres­sion of de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion. Statis­tics show that be­cause of the project, the mov­ing speed of the sand dunes in Maowusu Desert has been dras­ti­cally re­duced. For in­stance, the sed­i­ment load has de­clined by 53 per­cent, wind speed de­creased by 12 per­cent, wa­ter evap­o­ra­tion re­duced by 26 per­cent and the rel­a­tive hu­mid­ity of the at­mos­phere im­proved by 9,5 per­cent. At the same time, the or­ganic con­tent of the soil in­creased by 199 per­cent, while veg­e­ta­tion cov­er­age has reached 40,6 per­cent. To achieve all this, the of­fi­cials in Ningxia or­gan­ised farm­ers so that they also ben­e­fit fi­nan­cially from car­ry­ing out the project. The farm­ers are hired in­di­vid­u­ally and they in turn re­cruit their own labour force to carry out the task at hand. What is im­por­tant is that the of­fi­cials take this project se­ri­ously since it stands right in the way of their am­bi­tious plans to fight poverty. That de­ter­mi­na­tion is seen through the Deputy Di­rec­tor of the Ad­min­is­tra­tive Bureau of Na­tional Re­serve in Ningxia, Mr Wei Meng. His comments demon­strate how dif­fi­cult the work is, but at the same time shows the unity of pur­pose in achiev- ing the goal at hand. “It’s a very hard work be­cause the hottest sea­son in Ningxia is in July and that is when we get the straw, so it is even hard to work the sand which will be baked hot by the sun,” he said. “Ma­chines can­not be used to work on the sand be­cause they can­not have enough power on the type of soil, so ev­ery­thing is done man­u­ally.” The other aim of the project is to pro­tect the Yel­low River, the agri­cul­tural life line for Ningxia, which is of­ten chocked by sand from the desert. Be­fore the project, a lot of sand was de­posited into the river and when farm­ers wanted to use ir­ri­ga­tion wa­ter they had to re­move the sand many times a year. Now they re­move the sand less times, as much of it is with­held be­fore it goes into the river. So, what lessons can Africa draw from this de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion con­trol project in Ningxia? The first vi­tal point is that if peo­ple choose to ig­nore the ecosys­tem, life will get worse and worse, es­pe­cially in this era when the ef­fects of cli­mate change are be­ing felt more. Simple, ef­fec­tive and easy to im­ple­ment meth­ods must be un­der­taken in the fight against de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion if hopes to counter the ex­pan­sion of the Sa­hara desert can be en­ter­tained. There is also need for gov­ern­ments in the “first line of de­fence” against the Sa­hara Desert to pull their re­sources to­gether for this pur­pose. China, for ex­am­ple, has a huge fi­nan­cial com­mit­ment to the fight against de­for­esta­tion and de­ser­ti­fi­ca­tion, hav­ing spent around $33 bil­lion since 1999. If ac­tion is not taken now against the ex­pan­sion of the Sa­hara Desert, the ef­fects will be much more dev­as­tat­ing and costly. Agri­cul­tural and pas­toral land will van­ish in an in­stant, re­sult­ing in more fi­nan­cial re­sources needed to feed those af­fected and save live­stock. And the statis­tics are a bit scary for Africa. At least 40 per­cent of the con­ti­nent is al­ready a desert and the ad­vance rate is ex­pected to in­crease as cli­mate change deep­ens.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160416,9 au­di­tion for UN chief’s job,"NEW YORK — For the first time in the United Na­tions’ 70-year his­tory, can­di­dates have taken part in pub­lic ques­tion­ing by for­eign del­e­gates. Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the 193 mem­ber states were ea­ger at Thurs­day’s ses­sion to know their stance on press­ing is­sues, in­clud­ing the refugee cri­sis, the fu­ture of peace­keep­ing mis­sions, gen­der equal­ity, the eco­nomic im­pact of sanc­tions, peace talks in the Mid­dle East, and im­ple­ment­ing the am­bi­tious 2030 Agenda. The world is chang­ing rapidly as it faces a surge of transna­tional con­flicts, poverty and inequal­ity, the largest refugee cri­sis since World War II, and dwin­dling re­sources in the least de­vel­oped coun­tries. One per­son — the leader of the UN — is sup­posed to rep­re­sent the in­ter­ests of all seven bil­lion peo­ple on our planet. But with a tor­rent of crises span­ning the globe and calls for an over­haul of the UN get­ting louder amid sev­eral scan­dals, it will not be an easy job. Nine peo­ple think they are up to the task and want to suc­ceed Ban Ki-moon as sec­re­tary-gen­eral, whose sec­ond five-year term ends on De­cem­ber 31. “For the most dif­fi­cult job in the world we now have the most dif­fi­cult job in­ter­view of the world,” said Mo­gens Lykketoft, the pres­i­dent of the Gen­eral Assem­bly. Over the course of three days from April 12-14, each can­di­date was given two hours to speak in front of a crowded Gen­eral Assem­bly. Peo­ple from 70 coun­tries also sub­mit­ted more than 1,000 ques­tions on so­cial me­dia un­der #UNSG­can­di­dates. “We’re sail­ing into un­charted wa­ters here,” Lykketoft said. The tele­vised de­bate is meant to make the se­lec­tion more trans­par­ent, in­clu­sive and un­bi­ased. This pub­lic scru­tiny is also in­tended to hold the fu­ture leader ac­count­able to prom­ises made dur­ing the can­di­dacy. The change ends the UN mem­ber states’ long-felt frus­tra­tion that the five per­ma­nent mem­bers of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil — the US, Bri­tain, France, China and Rus­sia — held sole power over se­lect­ing the sec­re­tary­gen­eral, which they did be­hind closed doors — un­til to­day. Since 1946, there have been eight men at the helm of the supra­na­tional in­sti­tu­tion. Many states are call­ing for a fe­male sec­re­tary­gen­eral. Now four can­di­dates are women. Tra­di­tion­ally, the job of the world’s top di­plo­mat is ro­tated re­gion­ally. Rus­sia and East­ern Europe ar­gue that it is now their turn, as there has never been a leader from their re­gion. Seven can­di­dates are from East­ern Europe, in­creas­ing the odds. The Mid­dle East is a top pri­or­ity for all can­di­dates. They were asked to out­line their plans for the decades-long Pales­tine-Is­rael con­flict. He­len Clark from New Zealand, the cur­rent head of the UN De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme, said: “It’s a source of enor­mous sad­ness for me that it’s gone on my whole life­time with­out a so­lu­tion”. She pledged to do any­thing she can to help the Pales­tinian peo­ple. “We should feel guilty as long as we don’t have a so­lu­tion. The two-state-so­lu­tion must be im­ple­mented, how­ever, with Is­rael as an in­te­gral part of it. As long as Is­rael is part of the prob­lem, and not part of the so­lu­tion, I doubt that we’ll have a so­lu­tion,” can­di­date Srg­jan Kerim of Mace­do­nia echoed Clark’s stance on Pales­tinian in­de­pen­dence. Most con­tenders promised to ad­dress ter­ror­ism’s root causes. Clark in­sisted that she would be firm on re­li­gious tol­er­ance, ar­gu­ing: “Mus­lim com­mu­ni­ties are of­ten the sub­ject of marginal­i­sa­tion and stereo­typ­ing. We’ve to look at what drives re­cruit­ment for ex­trem­ism. “We’ve to cre­ate pos­i­tive choices in marginalised com­mu­ni­ties. The youth of­ten don’t have a lot of pos­i­tive choices, but plenty of neg­a­tive ones. They can be­come ji­hadists and traf­fick­ers of goods and peo­ple.” Syria was at the fore­front of the dis­cus­sion and many crit­i­cised the fact that a di­vided and dead­locked Se­cu­rity Coun­cil hin­dered assertive ac­tion in 2011, when Rus­sia and China ve­toed a draft res­o­lu­tion on hu­man­rights abuses and vi­o­lence in the country. Vesna Pusi, from Croa­tia, how­ever, be­lieves in Staffan de Mis­tura, spe­cial en­voy to Syria, who re­alised that in or­der to achieve a cease­fire he has to in­volve all sides. World­wide, 60 mil­lion peo­ple have left their home in­vol­un­tar­ily, flee­ing armed con­flicts, poverty and cli­mate change. Hun­dreds of thou­sands of refugees from coun­tries in­clud­ing Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq have passed along the Balkan Route, most of whom trav­elled through Turkey. “Th­ese peo­ple were refugees com­ing from a country that wasn’t helped in time,” Pusi said. In a sep­a­rate event out­side the UN head­quar­ters, four of the can­di­dates — Igor Luksi, from Mon­tene­gro, Danilo Turk, of Slove­nia, Pusi and Natalia Gher­man, from Moldova — took part in a hus­tings on April 13, fac­ing ques­tions from the pub­lic and non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs), also a first. A sec­ond hus­tings will be held in Lon­don on June 3. Dur­ing the hus­tings, com­par­isons were drawn be­tween this race and the si­mul­ta­ne­ously un­fold­ing US pres­i­den­tial elec­tions - the out­come of which could also have far-reach­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ram­i­fi­ca­tions. Luksi, who is seen as the un­der­dog can­di­date, jok­ingly asked: “Do we need to make the UN great again?” He said “the UN not only needs new faces, it also needs new ap­proaches” and dis­closed that he has so far spent 35,000 eu­ros ($39,400) on his cam­paign, fi­nanced by Mon­tene­gro’s state bud­get. All can­di­dates agreed on one is­sue - the need for im­prove­ment within the UN. “There’s been some de­tach­ment be­tween the UN and the peo­ple,” Luksi said. “We need to fight to make the UN rel­e­vant. — Al­Jazeera.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160819,Com­mit­ting to ac­tion for shared hu­man­ity,"TO­DAY, we com­mem­o­rate the World Hu­man­i­tar­ian Day which comes on the heels of the World Hu­man­i­tar­ian Sum­mit, the most piv­otal mo­ment in the his­tory of hu­man­i­tar­ian ac­tion, held in May 2016 in Turkey. At the sum­mit, over 9 000 par­tic­i­pants from 173 Mem­ber States, in­clud­ing 55 Heads of State and Gov­ern­ment, hun­dreds of pri­vate sec­tor rep­re­sen­ta­tives, and thou­sands of peo­ple from civil so­ci­ety and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, agreed to de­liver bet­ter hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance for the 130 mil­lion vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple all over the world. World Hu­man­i­tar­ian Day pro­vides us with unique op­por­tu­nity to pay tribute to hu­man­i­tar­ian work­ers who strive daily, in re­mote and harsh con­di­tions away from their loved ones to save lives of fel­low hu­mans and at times pay­ing with their lives in line of duty — the ser­vice of hu­man­ity. Glob­ally, the United Na­tions and its hu­man­i­tar­ian per­son­nel co­or­di­nate a $20,1 bil­lion ap­peal for hu­man­i­tar­ian needs of 87,6 mil­lion peo­ple and pro­vides food and non-food as­sis­tance to some 80 mil­lion peo­ple in 80 coun­tries. In ad­di­tion, the United Na­tions as­sists and pro­tects over 59 mil­lion peo­ple flee­ing war, famine, and per­se­cu­tion; and fights ex­treme poverty, help­ing to im­prove the liveli­hoods of more than one bil­lion peo­ple. The United Na­tions pro­tects and pro­motes hu­man rights on site through some 80 treaties and dec­la­ra­tions. It also sup­plies vac­cines for 40 per­cent of the world’s chil­dren, help­ing save 3 mil­lion lives a year while pro­vid­ing ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion to mil­lions of chil­dren. We also sup­port ma­ter­nal health, help­ing 30 mil­lion women sur­vive preg­nancy and child­birth and keep peace with over 125 000 peacekeepers in 16 op­er­a­tions on four con­ti­nents. The World Hu­man­i­tar­ian Day also al­lows us to re­flect and re­new our un­re­lent­ing ef­forts to pro­mote peace; end hunger; war and con­flict; suf­fer­ing; and even­tu­ally achieve free­doms from want and fear. Th­ese hu­man­i­tar­ian dec­la­ra­tions are not far-fetched; we have un­prece­dented ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy, science and wealth that could up­lift one bil­lion fel­low hu­man be­ings who live in ab­ject poverty and to end the mis­ery of over 800 mil­lion who go to bed hun­gry ev­ery day.

Ac­cord­ing to the South­ern Africa De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC), an es­ti­mated 41 mil­lion peo­ple in the re­gion are food in­se­cure, out of whom more than 21 mil­lion are in ur­gent need of hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance. In Zim­babwe, as the re­sult of the drought, some 4,1 mil­lion ru­ral peo­ple will not only be food in­se­cure dur­ing the peak hunger pe­riod of Jan­uary to March 2017 but the sit­u­a­tion also threat­ens to re­verse the de­vel­op­ment gains we have made over the past five years to re­sus­ci­tate ba­sic so­cial ser­vices. In re­sponse to the Gov­ern­ment’s Ap­peal is­sued in Fe­bru­ary 2016, the United Na­tions, hu­man­i­tar­ian part­ners and Non-Gov­ern­men­tal Or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) de­vel­oped a Hu­man­i­tar­ian Re­sponse Plan through a col­lab­o­ra­tive and joined-up ef­forts. The fo­cus of the plan is to save lives, while en­sur­ing link­ages to early re­cov­ery and re­silience build­ing pro­grammes. To en­sure a holis­tic and multi-sec­toral re­sponse, the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Re­sponse Plan cov­ers: Food Se­cu­rity and Agri­cul­ture; Health and Nu­tri­tion; Wa­ter, San­i­ta­tion and Hy­giene; Ed­u­ca­tion; and, Pro­tec­tion. Of the $360 mil­lion re­quested for the pe­riod of April 2016 — March 2017, nearly $190 mil­lion has been com­mit­ted en­abling the UN and hu­man­i­tar­ian part­ners to reach 1,5 mil­lion peo­ple with re­lief as­sis­tance.

Amai Mnan­gagwa said as a mother and cit­i­zen, she wanted de­vel­op­ment for the coun­try, adding that it was ev­ery cit­i­zen’s re­spon­si­bil­ity to work to­wards its trans­for­ma­tion. Re­count­ing her re­cent week-long visit to China, the First Lady said when po­ten­tial in­vestors in China heard about her im­pend­ing visit, they sought to hear the news she and her del­e­ga­tion had brought from Zim­babwe. “I had been in­vited as An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion pa­tron and I was pre­pared to talk about my foun­da­tion only, but it turned out to be more of in­vest­ment and so­cial is­sues,” she said. “I played my part and grabbed the op­por­tu­nity to dis­cuss with po­ten­tial in­vestors on var­i­ous is­sues for the de­vel­op­ment of our coun­try. “We spoke about Zim­babwe, the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion, what we need as a coun­try and in­vest­ment is­sues. We touched on var­i­ous sec­tors that in­cluded agri­cul­ture, min­ing, health and tourism. Chi­naBrand In­ter­na­tional Com­mer­cial has been fol­low­ing my phil­an­thropic work and its direc­tor Mrs Ju­liana El­hawary be­came in­ter­ested and looked for me. “When she in­vited me here, she in­di­cated that she also wanted Gov­ern­ment min­istries on board as she had mo­bilised the Chi­nese busi­ness com­mu­nity. I then sought per­mis­sion from the Pres­i­dent to in­clude rep­re­sen­ta­tives from dif­fer­ent min­istries in my del­e­ga­tion.” The First Lady said her del­e­ga­tion met var­i­ous com­pa­nies that ex­pressed will­ing­ness to in­vest in Zim­babwe and one such com­pany is China Lesso which deals mainly in agri­cul­tural equip­ment and has ad­vanced ir­ri­ga­tion mech­a­nisms. She said the firm ex­pressed will­ing­ness to set up a plant in Zim­babwe and to of­fer tech­ni­cal sup­port. The First Lady spoke about a Chi­nese med­i­cal oxy­gen en­gi­neer­ing firm Techray Med­i­cal Tech­nol­ogy Co Ltd that also ex­pressed in­ter­est in set­ting up man­u­fac­tur­ing plants at Zim­babwe’s five re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals, in a de­vel­op­ment ex­pected to re­duce the coun­try’s med­i­cal oxy­gen im­port bill. She said it was im­por­tant for the coun­try to have a med­i­cal oxy­gen plant, adding that lives would be saved. The First Lady said Zim­babwe needed in­vest­ment and in­vited those keen on help­ing the coun­try to do so freely, adding that ‘Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness’. “As a cit­i­zen and a mother, I have done my part,” she said. “We are re­build­ing our coun­try and I urge ev­ery­one to work hard so that we ful­fil our vi­sion. The en­gage­ments we had here, we should take them se­ri­ously be­cause our Chi­nese friends are will­ing to help us.” The First Lady said Zim­bab­weans needed a changed mind­set and to stop paint­ing the coun­try black. “We need growth and it is time for ev­ery­one to work hard,” she said. “Our Pres­i­dent needs our sup­port as the coun­try is in its tran­si­tional pe­riod. Let us put our heads to­gether and work for Zim­babwe, it is our coun­try.” Amai Mnan­gagwa said Women’s Af­fairs, Com­mu­nity, Small and Medium En­ter­prises De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Sithem­biso Ny­oni, who was part of the del­e­ga­tion, would re­lay to the Gov­ern­ment in­for­ma­tion on com­pa­nies that ex­pressed will­ing­ness to es­tab­lish busi­nesses in Zim­babwe as part of mea­sures to re­build the econ­omy. “We have our Vice-Pres­i­dents in Zim­babwe and each one of them has his area of spe­cialty,” she said. “Vice-Pres­i­dent Con­stantino Chi­wenga is on the eco­nomic side, while VP Kembo Mo­hadi is on the so­cial side. “There­fore, I came with Min­is­ter Sithem­biso Ny­oni who was also on the in­vited guests’ list rep­re­sent­ing her min­istry and she re­ports to both Vice-Pres­i­dents. She is go­ing to present to them what tran­spired here and the in­for­ma­tion will be for­warded to the Pres­i­dent. As for me, I played my part.” Amai Mnan­gagwa’s sen­ti­ments come at a time when it is be­com­ing abun­dantly clear that Zim­babwe stands to reap im­mense ben­e­fits from its re­la­tions with China, judg­ing by the will­ing­ness of com­pa­nies in the Asian gi­ant to in­vest. Barely three weeks ago, the First Lady was in Ac­cra, Ghana, with a del­e­ga­tion of women in tourism to ex­pose them to the new mar­ket since women em­pow­er­ment is also close to her heart. This is against the back­drop of other in­come-gen­er­at­ing projects she has rolled out across the length and breadth of the coun­try. A rep­re­sen­ta­tive from the Em­bassy of Zim­babwe in Bei­jing, China, Coun­sel­lor Garikai Kashitiku show­ered the First Lady with praises over her ini­tia­tive which he said dove­tails with her po­si­tion as the mother of the na­tion. In his de­tailed pre­sen­ta­tion dur­ing one of the busi­ness meet­ings be­tween the Zim­babwe del­e­ga­tion and the Chi­nese busi­ness peo­ple, Mr Kashitiku de­scribed farm­ing as crit­i­cal to en­sure food se­cu­rity and cre­ate em­ploy­ment for ci­ti­zens. He spelt the need to forge ahead with “win­win” co­op­er­a­tion and to take ad­van­tage of the el­e­va­tion of Zim­babwe’s re­la­tions with China to Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship Co­op­er­a­tion. He said the move should re­sult in in­creased ex­ports of agri­cul­tural pro­duce rang­ing from food crops (maize, sorghum, su­gar beans, sweet pota­toes) to cash crops (tobacco, soya beans, cot­ton) and hor­ti­cul­ture crops (tea, cof­fee, macadamia nuts, ba­nanas, av­o­cado and cit­rus fruits). This in ad­di­tion to live­stock - cat­tle, sheep, goats and pigs. Mr Kashitiku at­trib­uted the good qual­ity of Zim­babwe’s agri­cul­tural prod­ucts to favourable cli­matic con­di­tions and fer­tile soils. Op­por­tu­ni­ties in the agri­cul­ture sec­tor, he said, were lim­it­less as more op­por­tu­ni­ties were avail­able in the en­tire agribusi­ness value chain from farm­ing, agro-pro­cess­ing, pack­ag­ing, re­frig­er­a­tion, mar­ket­ing, lo­gis­tics, agro-equip­ment and chem­i­cals sup­ply. He im­plored the Chi­nese to take ad­van­tage of the land re­form and part­ner small­holder farm­ers through con­tract farm­ing and as­sured them that Zim­bab­wean farm­ers were only new in terms of land own­er­ship, but were very ex­pe­ri­enced. Mr Kashitiku said the Chi­nese must part­ner the First Lady’s An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion which was fight­ing tooth and nail to en­sure that vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of so­ci­ety and marginalised com­mu­ni­ties ac­tively par­tic­i­pated in the re­vival of the coun­try’s econ­omy. He said as the coun­try pur­sued its eco­nomic re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion, it was ob­vi­ous that Gov­ern­ment had pri­ori­tised cer­tain key driv­ers of eco­nomic growth. The United Na­tions Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs), Mr Kashitiku said, called for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment that left no one be­hind. “Thus, the in­au­gu­ral visit by the First Lady, Amai Aux­il­lia Mnan­gagwa, in her ca­pac­ity as the founder of An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion whose fo­cus is to iden­tify and as­sist the vul­ner­a­ble and dis­ad­van­taged mem­bers and com­mu­ni­ties in Zim­babwe, was meant to en­sure that the coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment is in­clu­sive,” he said. Mr Rea­son Machigere spoke on be­half of the Min­istry of En­vi­ron­ment, Cli­mate Change, Tourism and Hos­pi­tal­ity In­dus­try, while Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Mr Den­ford Mu­tashu rep­re­sented his con­stituency - the re­tail­ers. Min­er­als Mar­ket­ing Cor­po­ra­tion of Zim­babwe (MMCZ), rep­re­sented by Mrs Otilia Fu­rusa, in­vited the Chi­nese to con­sider in­vest­ing in the mar­ket­ing of lo­cal min­er­als. Min­istry of Women Af­fairs, Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment and Small and Medium En­ter­prises rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ms Beauty Razemba gave an over­view of the con­tri­bu­tion of SMEs to eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and in­vited the Chi­nese to part­ner and sup­port them us­ing var­i­ous fi­nanc­ing mod­els to en­able them to ac­cess small to light in­dus­trial equip­ment and ma­chin­ery. Be­ing the lead min­istry that spear­heads the em­pow­er­ment of women in Zim­babwe, it im­pressed upon the Chi­nese busi­ness com­mu­nity to sup­port the First Lady’s vi­sion of sup­port­ing the vul­ner­a­ble and dis­ad­van­taged, in­clud­ing women, or­phans, the el­derly and marginalised com­mu­ni­ties in es­tab­lish­ing in­come-gen­er­at­ing projects. From the pri­vate sec­tor, Mrs Olinda Mahufe, the deputy direc­tor of Voed­sel Tobacco In­ter­na­tional, a tobacco mer­chant com­pany quipped: “I would like to thank the First Lady for grant­ing me this op­por­tu­nity to be part of her busi­ness del­e­ga­tion to China. Voed­sel Tobacco In­ter­na­tional strives to build the econ­omy through em­pow­er­ment, thereby cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment, a step to­wards poverty erad­i­ca­tion. “Our wish is to ex­plore the Chi­nese mar­ket. This will gen­er­ate the much-needed for­eign cur­rency to Zim­babwe. Strate­gic part­ner­ships with the Chi­nese would usher in top-of-the-range mech­a­ni­sa­tion which boosts pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, thus restor­ing the bread bas­ket sta­tus of Zim­babwe to sus­tain her­self, Africa, and the world at large.” Mrs Lil­ian Gonga of Chalk­mount En­ter­prises, whose com­pany is into road and hous­ing con­struc­tion, said she felt hon­oured to be part of the First Lady’s del­e­ga­tion to Guangzhou. “This trip was very ben­e­fi­cial to my com­pany and the coun­try at large,” she said. “I met with sev­eral Chi­nese busi­ness­peo­ple who are ea­ger to in­vest in con­struc­tion in Zim­babwe. Their re­sponse is very en­cour­ag­ing for my com­pany and our coun­try. “Some want part­ner­ships, while some want to em­bark on huge projects such as build­ing ho­tels and hos­pi­tals. Af­ter tour­ing a com­pany that man­u­fac­tures PVC pipes of all sizes, I saw an op­por­tu­nity to go into man­u­fac­tur­ing of such pipes on a small-scale to start with, since these plas­tics are used ex­ten­sively in build­ing as plumb­ing and elec­tri­cal tub­ing etc. “This will re­duce the need to im­port such items into Zim­babwe.” Over­ally, the Min­istry of Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment rep­re­sented by Mr Charles Tahwa said it ben­e­fited im­mensely from the con­fer­ence which gave in­vestors in­sight into Zim­babwe’s rich min­eral re­sources. “Key among the is­sues raised was in­ter­est on new pol­icy re­forms and easy of do­ing busi­ness,” he said. “Min­eral com­mod­ity deal­ers were in­ter­ested in the avail­abil­ity of min­eral com­modi­ties in par­tic­u­lar plat­inum, gold, di­a­mond and prospects of en­hanced jewellery man­u­fac­tur­ing. “The well-ar­ranged tours to com­pa­nies and in­sti­tu­tions ex­posed the del­e­ga­tion to tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances, strate­gic and roadmap for the de­mand for com­modi­ties, par­tic­u­larly lithium bat­ter­ies. The in­ter­ests on set­ting up plants and cor­po­ra­tions presents op­por­tu­ni­ties to de­vel­op­ment and mod­ernising our min­ing sec­tor.” Mr Tahwa said the com­mit­ment from the First Lady and the del­e­ga­tion demon­strated to Chi­nese in­vestors that in­deed Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness. Dr Bernard Madz­ima and Mr Love­more Musarurwa rep­re­sented the Min­istry of Health and Child Care on the trip.",津巴布韦
zw,The Manica Post,20171201,Arda at­tracts new in­vestors,"AF­TER years of ne­glect, Agri­cul­tural and Ru­ral De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (Arda) has man­aged to lure in­vestors whose cap­i­tal in­jec­tion will un­lock and trans­form agri­cul­tural de­vel­op­ment, im­prove the pro­duc­tiv­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity at all its es­tates. Arda owns 22 es­tates across the coun­try, which trans­lates to about 100 000 hectares, most of which have been ly­ing idle ow­ing to vi­a­bil­ity chal­lenges largely em­a­nat­ing from poor fund­ing. Katiyo Tea Es­tate (Mu­tasa), Rusitu Es­tate (Chipinge), Gairezi Es­tate (Nyanga), Chisum­banje and Mid­dle Sabi are some of its es­tates in Man­i­ca­land where the fi­nan­cial in­jec­tion is set to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity, cre­ate more jobs, grow enough nu­tri­tious food to feed the na­tion and ex­port crops while sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce poverty lev­els among small-holder out grow­ers. Arda chair­man Mr Basil Nyabadza, though re­fus­ing to men­tion names, said they se­cured in­vestors in­ter­ested in dairy and live­stock; macadamia, pecan and cashew nuts; maize, soy­abeans, tim­ber, pota­toes, but­ter nuts, ste­via and chia. “We have just se­cured an in­vestor to do a plan­ta­tion of pecan nuts that are ded­i­cated for ex­port. The in­vestors were se­cured un­der the 10-Point Plan us­ing the pub­lic pri­vate part­ner­ships business model,” said Mr Nyabadza. He said Arda has planted 10 000 hectares of sugar cane and 200 hectares of tea while dairy farm­ing, macadamia nuts and tim­ber plan­ta­tions were in full throt­tle in Man­i­ca­land. “We have se­cured long-term in­vestors to im­prove our plan­ta­tions for both macadamia nuts and tim­ber plan­ta­tions,” he said. Mr Nyabadza said Arda has started run­ning tri­als for ste­via, which is a sub­sti­tute for sugar cane. Ste­via is a sweet­ener used in the bev­er­ages in­dus­try. “It is a first of its kind in Zim­babwe. It is a huge in­dus­try be­cause peo­ple are now run­ning away from sugar,” he added. The Arda chair­man said it was now Arda’s thrust to pro­mote pro­duc­tion of non-tra­di­tional ded­i­cated ex­port crops such as pecan nut, macadamia and cashew nuts in Man­i­ca­land and through small-scale out grow­ers in line with its man­date to bring pos­i­tive change in ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties. Arda, he said, has in­creased ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion at most of its es­tates to around 75 per­cent from the 15 per­cent recorded over the past five years. Its tea and cof­fee plan­ta­tions had col­lapsed fol­low­ing poor prices on the world mar­ket which saw many grow­ers in Man­i­ca­land aban­don­ing the crops in favour of ba­nanas. The num­ber of tea grow­ers fell by 60 per­cent to 1 200 from 3 000 in 2005. Mr Nyabadza said in­tro­duc­tion of non-tra­di­tional crops fol­lows acute de­mand from the Asian, Euro­pean and Arab coun­tries. Macadamia is now a life­line for hun­dreds of farm­ers in Chipinge where the crop is ex­ported pri­mar­ily to China and South Africa where de­mand is high. Macadamia, pecan nuts and cashew nuts are high value crops, which were pre­vi­ously a pre­serve of a few white farm­ers. Th­ese plan­ta­tion crops also grow bet­ter in ar­eas where av­o­ca­dos, pa­payas, man­goes and ba­nanas do well. Great de­mand for pecan nuts is also in China. Other non-tra­di­tional crops and mar­ket-led crops be­ing tar­geted by Arda in­clude granadilla, chia — which is on de­mand from the Arab world, man­goes, av­o­ca­does, baby corns, egg­plant, broc­coli, but­ter nut, cau­li­flower, cu­cum­bers, gar­lic, gar­nsquash, mon­key tout peas, okra, sweet pep­per, red­dish, spinach, spring onion, pas­sion fruit, straw­ber­ries, sweet mel­ons and young berries.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170511,LEV­ER­AG­ING RE­MIT­TANCES FOR DE­VEL­OP­MENT:,"THE Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe Deputy Gov­er­nor Dr Kupuk­ile Mlambo de­liv­ered a very good pre­sen­ta­tion which show­cased the state of the fi­nan­cial sec­tor and liq­uid­ity po­si­tion. In his pre­sen­ta­tion, he high­lighted di­as­pora re­mit­tances as sec­ond key source of liq­uid­ity af­ter ex­ports. What was clear was that if we get our for­mula right we can ad­dress liq­uid­ity cri­sis on the back of in­crease in re­mit­tances. In this dis­cus­sion and sub­se­quent weeks I will pro­vide dis­course on is­sues sur­round­ing di­as­pora re­mit­tances. Although most of the statis­tics are out­dated as they date back to 2006 they still pro­vide use­ful in­sights on the role of re­mit­tances on de­vel­op­ment. Re­mit­tances re­ceived from mi­grants abroad are one of the largest sources of ex­ter­nal fi­nance for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. In 2006, recorded re­mit­tances sent home by mi­grants from de­vel­op­ing coun­tries reached $206 bil­lion, up from $193 bil­lion in 2005 and more than dou­ble 2001’s level. The true size of re­mit­tances, in­clud­ing un­recorded flows through for­mal and in­for­mal chan­nels, is be­lieved to be even larger. They are al­most as large as for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, and more than twice as large as the of­fi­cial aid re­ceived by de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The dou­bling of recorded re­mit­tances over the past five years is a re­sult of a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors: bet­ter mea­sure­ment of flows; in­creased scru­tiny since the ter­ror­ist at­tacks of Septem­ber 2001; re­duc­tion in re­mit­tance costs and ex­pand­ing net­works in the money trans­fer in­dus­try; de­pre­ci­a­tion of the US dol­lar (rais­ing the dol­lar value of re­mit­tances in other cur­ren­cies); and growth in the mi­grant stock and in­comes. Poor coun­tries re­ceive rel­a­tively larger re­mit­tances In 2006, ac­cord­ing to World Bank, the top three re­cip­i­ents of re­mit­tances - In­dia, China, and Mex­ico - each re­ceived nearly $25 bil­lion. As noted by World Bank, smaller and poorer coun­tries tend to re­ceive rel­a­tively larger re­mit­tances in pro­por­tion to the size of their economies. Ex­press­ing re­mit­tances as a share of GDP, the top re­cip­i­ents were Moldova (30 per­cent), Tonga (27 per­cent), Guyana (22 per­cent), and Haiti (21per­cent). Re­mit­tances are thus more evenly dis­trib­uted across de­vel­op­ing coun­tries than are pri­vate cap­i­tal flows. Re­mit­tances are sta­ble or even coun­ter­cycli­cal Re­mit­tances tend to be more sta­ble than pri­vate cap­i­tal flows, and may even be coun­ter­cycli­cal rel­a­tive to the re­cip­i­ent econ­omy. Ev­i­dence shows that re­mit­tances tend to rise when the re­cip­i­ent econ­omy suf­fers a down­turn in ac­tiv­ity, an eco­nomic cri­sis, nat­u­ral dis­as­ter, or po­lit­i­cal con­flict, as mi­grants may send more funds dur­ing hard times to help their fam­i­lies and friends. For ex­am­ple, re­mit­tances rose dur­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1995 in Mex­ico and in 1998 in In­done­sia and Thai­land. They also in­creased fol­low­ing hur­ri­canes in Cen­tral Amer­ica. In So­ma­lia and Haiti, they have pro­vided a life­line for the poor. In ad­di­tion to bring­ing the di­rect ben­e­fit of higher wages earned abroad, mi­gra­tion helps house­holds di­ver­sify their sources of in­come and thus re­duce their vul­ner­a­bil­ity to risks. Re­mit­tances re­duce poverty Re­mit­tances di­rectly aug­ment the in­come of re­cip­i­ent house­holds. In ad­di­tion to pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial re­sources for poor house­holds, they af­fect poverty and wel­fare through in­di­rect mul­ti­plier ef­fects and also macroe­co­nomic ef­fects. These flows typ­i­cally do not suf­fer from the gov­er­nance prob­lems that may be as­so­ci­ated with of­fi­cial aid flows. Re­gres­sion anal­y­sis across coun­tries world­wide shows the sig­nif­i­cant poverty re­duc­tion ef­fects of re­mit­tances: A 10 per­cent in­crease in per capita of­fi­cial re­mit­tances may lead to a 3,5 per­cent de­cline in the share of poor peo­ple. Re­cent re­search in­di­cates that re­mit­tances re­duced poverty in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa and Latin Amer­ica, although with ef­fects that vary across coun­tries. House­hold sur­vey data show that re­mit­tances have re­duced the poverty head­count ra­tio (per­cent of pop­u­la­tion be­low the na­tional poverty line) sig­nif­i­cantly in sev­eral low in­come coun­tries - by 11 per­cent­age points in Uganda, 6 per­cent­age points in Bangladesh, and 5 in Ghana. In Nepal, re­mit­tances may ex­plain a quar­ter to a half of the 11 per­cent­age-point re­duc­tion in the poverty head­count rate over the past decade (in the face of a dif­fi­cult po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion). The anal­y­sis of the poverty im­pact of re­mit­tances must take into ac­count the loss of in­come that the mi­grant may ex­pe­ri­ence due to mi­gra­tion (for ex­am­ple, if the mi­grant has to give up his or her job). Such losses are likely to be small for the poor and un­em­ployed but large for the mid­dle- and up­per in­come classes. Very poor mi­grants may not be able to send re­mit­tances in the ini­tial years af­ter their mi­gra­tion. Also, the re­mit­tances of very rich mi­grants may be smaller than the loss of in­come due to mi­gra­tion. But for the mid­dle-in­come groups, re­mit­tances en­able re­cip­i­ents to move up to a higher in­come group. In Sri Lanka, for ex­am­ple, house­holds from the third through the eighth in­come decile moved up the in­come lad­der due to re­mit­tances. Re­mit­tances fi­nance ed­u­ca­tion, health, and en­trepreneur­ship Re­mit­tances are as­so­ci­ated with in­creased house­hold in­vest­ments in ed­u­ca­tion, en­trepreneur­ship, and health - all of which have a high so­cial re­turn in most cir­cum­stances. Stud­ies based on house­hold sur­veys in El Sal­vador and Sri Lanka find that chil­dren of re­mit­tance-re­ceiv­ing house­holds have a lower school dropout ra­tio and that these house­holds spend more on pri­vate tu­ition for their chil­dren. In Sri Lanka, the chil­dren in re­mit­tance-re­ceiv­ing house­holds have higher birth weight, re­flect­ing that re­mit­tances en­able house­holds to af­ford bet­ter health care. Sev­eral stud­ies also show that re­mit­tances pro­vide cap­i­tal to small en­trepreneurs, re­duce credit con­straints, and in­crease en­trepreneur­ship. Lev­er­ag­ing re­mit­tances for de­vel­op­ment Gov­ern­ments in des­ti­na­tion and ori­gin coun­tries can fa­cil­i­tate re­mit­tance flows and en­hance their de­vel­op­ment im­pacts through the ap­pli­ca­tion of ap­pro­pri­ate poli­cies. How­ever, some cur­rent pol­icy prac­tices pose pit­falls. Al­most all de­vel­op­ing coun­tries of­fer tax in­cen­tives to at­tract re­mit­tances, but such tax ex­emp­tions on re­mit­tances may en­cour­age tax eva­sion. Match­ing-fund pro­grams (such as Mex­ico’s 3-for-1 pro­gram, in which the mu­nic­i­pal, state, and na­tional gov­ern­ments match mi­grant or­ga­ni­za­tions’ in­vest­ments in de­vel­op­ment) may ef­fec­tively lever­age small vol­umes of col­lec­tive re­mit­tances from mi­grant as­so­ci­a­tions for small com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment projects, but such pro­grams may not be scal­able and may di­vert funds from other lo­cal fund­ing pri­or­i­ties. Ef­forts to chan­nel re­mit­tances to in­vest­ment have met with lit­tle suc­cess. In­stead, ef­forts should be made to im­prove the over­all in­vest­ment cli­mate in the ori­gin coun­tries. Some gov­ern­ments have been toy­ing with the idea of tax­ing re­mit­tances. This would have an ef­fect sim­i­lar to that of rais­ing re­mit­tance costs and would hurt the poor mi­grants and their fam­i­lies in ori­gin coun­tries. Tax­a­tion would also drive re­mit­tance flows fur­ther un­der­ground. Re­mit­tances should not be viewed as a sub­sti­tute for of­fi­cial de­vel­op­ment aid. Fun­da­men­tally, they are pri­vate money that should not be ex­pected to fund pub­lic projects. Not all poor house­holds re­ceive re­mit­tances; of­fi­cial fund­ing is nec­es­sary to ad­dress the needs of such house­holds. Lev­er­ag­ing re­mit­tances for the fi­nan­cial ac­cess of mi­grants and their ben­e­fi­cia­ries En­cour­ag­ing re­mit­tances through bank­ing chan­nels can im­prove the de­vel­op­ment im­pact of re­mit­tances by en­cour­ag­ing more sav­ing and en­abling bet­ter match­ing of sav­ing with in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. Re­mit­tances re­ceived as cash are less likely to be saved than those re­ceived through a bank ac­count. For many poor house­holds and mi­grants, re­mit­tances are the only point of con­tact with the for­mal fi­nan­cial sec­tor. By pro­vid­ing re­mit­tance ser­vices, banks and other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions can at­tract new cus­tomers for their de­posit and loan prod­ucts. Mi­cro-fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions can use the his­tory of re­mit­tance re­ceipts to judge the credit his­tory of po­ten­tial cus­tomers. Re­mit­tances are al­most as large as for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, and more than twice as large as of­fi­cial aid re­ceived by de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Both send­ing and re­ceiv­ing coun­tries can in­crease mi­grants’ bank­ing ac­cess by al­low­ing ori­gin coun­try banks to op­er­ate over­seas and pro­vid­ing iden­ti­fi­ca­tion cards (such as the Mex­i­can ma­trícula con­sular), which are ac­cepted by banks to open ac­counts. Ac­cess to re­mit­tance ser­vices in ru­ral and re­mote ar­eas can be im­proved by en­cour­ag­ing the par­tic­i­pa­tion of mi­cro-fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions, credit unions, and sav­ing banks (in­clud­ing postal sav­ing schemes) in the re­mit­tance mar­ket. Ex­ist­ing reg­u­la­tions may need to be amended to al­low these in­sti­tu­tions to more fully par­tic­i­pate in pro­vid­ing re­mit­tance ser­vices. In many coun­tries, mi­cro-fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions would need le­gal per­mis­sion to re­ceive for­eign ex­change. In some cases, they may need lim­ited ac­cess to na­tional clear­ance and set­tle­ment sys­tems. Lev­er­ag­ing re­mit­tances for cap­i­tal mar­ket ac­cess of fi­nan­cial in­ter­me­di­aries Re­mit­tances can im­prove a coun­try’s cred­it­wor­thi­ness and thereby en­hance its ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional cap­i­tal mar­kets. Hard cur­rency re­mit­tances, prop­erly ac­counted, can sig­nif­i­cantly im­prove coun­try-risk rat­ing, and thereby lower their cost of bor­row­ing money in in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. The ra­tio of debt to ex­ports of goods and ser­vices, a key in­debt­ed­ness in­di­ca­tor, would in­crease sig­nif­i­cantly if re­mit­tances were ex­cluded from the de­nom­i­na­tor. Model-based cal­cu­la­tions us­ing debt-to-ex­port ra­tios that in­clude re­mit­tances in the de­nom­i­na­tor in­di­cate that in­clud­ing re­mit­tances in cred­it­wor­thi­ness as­sess­ments would im­prove credit rat­ings for Le­banon and Haiti (by two notches) and re­sult in im­plied sov­er­eign spread (the dif­fer­ence in in­ter­est rates be­tween a sov­er­eign bond and com­pa­ra­ble US trea­suries) re­duc­tions rang­ing from 130 to 334 ba­sis points. Fu­ture flows of re­mit­tances can be used as col­lat­eral to im­prove the rat­ing of com­mer­cial (sub-sov­er­eign) bor­row­ers. Sev­eral banks in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries (such as Brazil, Egypt, El Sal­vador, Gu­atemala, Kaza­khstan, Mex­ico, and Turkey) have been able to raise cheaper and longert­erm fi­nanc­ing (more than $15 bil­lion since 2000) from in­ter­na­tional cap­i­tal mar­kets via the se­cu­ri­ti­sa­tion of fu­ture re­mit­tance flows. By mit­i­gat­ing cur­rency con­vert­ibil­ity risk, a key com­po­nent of sov­er­eign risk, the fu­ture flow se­cu­ri­ti­sa­tion struc­ture al­lows se­cu­ri­ties to be rated bet­ter than the sov­er­eign credit rat­ing. In the case of El Sal­vador, for ex­am­ple, the re­mit­tance-backed se­cu­ri­ties were rated in­vest­ment grade, two to four notches above the sub-in­vest­ment grade sov­er­eign rat­ing. In­vest­ment grade rat­ing makes these trans­ac­tions at­trac­tive to a wider range of “buy-and-hold” in­vestors (for ex­am­ple, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies) that face lim­i­ta­tions on buy­ing sub-in­vest­ment grade. As a re­sult, the is­suer can ac­cess in­ter­na­tional cap­i­tal mar­kets at a lower in­ter­est rate spread and longer ma­tu­rity. More­over, by es­tab­lish­ing a credit his­tory for the bor­rower, these deals en­hance the abil­ity and re­duce the costs of ac­cess­ing cap­i­tal mar­kets in the fu­ture. Re­duc­ing re­mit­tance costs Re­duc­ing re­mit­tance fees would in­crease the dis­pos­able in­come of poor mi­grants, boost their in­cen­tives to send more money home, and en­cour­age the use of for­mal re­mit­tance chan­nels. The cost of send­ing re­mit­tances tends to be high and re­gres­sive. A typ­i­cal poor mi­grant sends about $200 or less per trans­ac­tion. The av­er­age cost through the top three money trans­fer op­er­a­tors (Western Union, MoneyGram, and Dolex) can be as high as $16 for $100 and $18 for $200. These fees are highly re­gres­sive be­cause the smaller re­mit­tances sent by poor mi­grants cost more per dol­lar sent. With in­creased aware­ness among pol­i­cy­mak­ers and mi­grants, and due to the fall­ing costs of tech­nol­ogy, re­mit­tance costs have been de­clin­ing in re­cent years. In the US – Mex­ico cor­ri­dor, for ex­am­ple, the cost of send­ing $300 fell by 54 per­cent be­tween 1999 and 2004, from more than $26 to $12. Since then, how­ever, costs have re­mained sticky, drop­ping only to $10,60 by the end of 2006. ◆ Dr Mugano is an Au­thor and Ex­pert in Trade and Com­pet­i­tive­ness.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190903,Ar­gentina im­poses cur­rency con­trols . . . to sup­port econ­omy,"FIRMS will have to seek cen­tral bank per­mis­sion to sell pe­sos to buy for­eign cur­rency and to make trans­fers abroad. Ar­gentina is also seek­ing to de­fer debt pay­ments to the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) to deal with the cri­sis. What has the gov­ern­ment said? In an of­fi­cial bul­letin is­sued on Sun­day, the gov­ern­ment said that it was nec­es­sary to adopt “a se­ries of ex­tra­or­di­nary mea­sures to en­sure the nor­mal func­tion­ing of the econ­omy, to sus­tain the level of ac­tiv­ity and em­ploy­ment and pro­tect the con­sumers”. The cen­tral bank said the mea­sures were in­tended to “main­tain cur­rency sta­bil­ity”. It also said that while in­di­vid­u­als can con­tinue to buy US dol­lars, they will need to seek per­mis­sion to pur­chase more than $10,000 (£8,223.50) a month. The mea­sures will ap­ply un­til the end of this year. What trig­gered the cur­rent cri­sis? Ar­gentina has been strug­gling with a fi­nan­cial cri­sis, which was ex­ac­er­bated by the pres­i­dent’s de­feat in a re­cent pri­mary poll. The peso fell to a record low last month after the vote showed that the busi­ness-friendly gov­ern­ment of Pres­i­dent Mauri­cio Macri is likely to be ousted in elec­tions in Oc­to­ber. Mr Macri was elected in 2015 on prom­ises to boost Ar­gentina’s econ­omy with a raft of lib­eral eco­nomic re­forms. But the coun­try is in a deep re­ces­sion. It has one of the world’s high­est in­fla­tion rates, run­ning at 22% dur­ing the first half of the year. Ar­gentina’s econ­omy con­tracted by 5.8% in the first quar­ter of 2019, after shrink­ing 2.5% last year. Three mil­lion peo­ple have fallen into poverty over the past year. How is the move likely to be re­ceived? Or­di­nary Ar­gen­tines have tra­di­tion­ally had lit­tle faith in their own cur­rency, pre­fer­ring to con­vert their spare pe­sos into dol­lars as soon as they can. They don’t trust fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions much ei­ther, so they re­sort to what is lo­cally known as the “colchón bank” - that is, stuff­ing their dol­lars un­der the mat­tress. Anec­do­tal sto­ries abound of peo­ple keep­ing money buried in the gar­den, hid­den in the walls or even stuffed in heat­ing sys­tems - oc­ca­sion­ally with dis­as­trous con­se­quences if there is an unex- pected cold snap. When you con­sider Ar­gentina’s his­tory of ram­pant in­fla­tion and cur­rency volatil­ity, they ar­guably have a point. But it does mean that any re­stric­tions on peo­ple’s abil­ity to buy dol­lars have an enor­mous psy­cho- log­i­cal im­pact. How does this com­pare with pre­vi­ous cri­sis mea­sures? The $10,000 ceil­ing for dol­lar trans­ac­tions is cer­tainly gen­er­ous in com­par­i­son with past ac­tions. Peo­ple still have bad mem­o­ries of the “cor­ral­ito”, im­posed in 2001, which stopped all with­drawals of dol­lars from bank ac­counts for a whole year. The only se­ri­ous at­tempt to wean Ar­gen­tines off their dol­lar de­pen­dency dates back to the 1990s un­der Pres­i­dent Car­los Menem, when the peso’s value was fixed by law at par­ity with the dol­lar. But that put the fi­nan­cial sys­tem un­der se­vere strain, lead­ing to the eco­nomic melt­down of 200102. How bad can Ar­gentina’s cri­sis get? The coun­try is strug­gling to stave off its fifth debt de­fault in 30 years. Last week, it said it would seek to re­struc­ture its debt with the IMF by ex­tend­ing its ma­tu­rity. This would give the coun­try more time to pay back the money it owes to the IMF. Rat­ing agen­cies, in­clud­ing Stan­dard & Poor’s and Fitch, de­cided that amounted to a de­fault and down­graded the coun­try’s credit rat­ings. What­ever hap­pens in Ar­gentina, the risk of fi­nan­cial con­ta­gion is low, say an­a­lysts. Even in the rest of Latin Amer­ica, mar­kets are un­likely to suf­fer. The US-China trade war and the slow­down in global growth are much more of a threat.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20190216,THE REAL REA­SONS BE­HIND PROS­TI­TU­TION,"univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion and fur­ther ad­vance­ment and most state that they in­tend to leave the business once they have earned the amount they want. It does not sound so cat­a­strophic when it is laid out like this, does it? In fact, it al­most glam­ourises it and de­mands re­spect to be put to it. How­ever, this is not the case with all groups of sex work­ers. A sur­vey car­ried out by sci­en­cenordic.com shows that there are a num­ber of rea­sons that rank al­most as high as money. Be­fore we go to those, let us talk about poverty and how it is leav­ing some of our sis­ters with no choice but to sell their bod­ies for as lit­tle as a $2. When the peo­ple in the work­shop de­scribed to us how and why young women in their com­mu­nity got caught up in pros­ti­tu­tion I got the sense that even though they did not agree with the act they al­most did not blame and sort of un­der­stood why these women had to do it. Of course we have your typ­i­cal “lady of the night” who is too lazy to work and think cre­atively of ways to make money con­struc­tively. On the other hand, you have a 17 year old or­phan who has to fend for her three younger sib­lings yet she still has no qual­i­fi­ca­tion. Any sort of cap­i­tal is non-ex­is­tent and the way Zim­babwe is set up for now; the op­por­tu­ni­ties are also just imag­i­nary. Be hon­est, if you found your­self in the same des­per­ate sit­u­a­tion, would you not panic and reach out to the first so­lu­tion that came your way even if it came with a nau­se­at­ing job de­scrip­tion and a $2 pay­out? It is at that point that I de­cided I would bring it up on this plat­form just to have a feel of what other Zim­bab­weans thought and felt about the is­sue. An­other rea­son for pros­ti­tu­tion that was also very com­mon was sex­ual abuse. The sur­vey showed that most women who are driven to sex work were vic­tims of some sort of sex­ual abuse in their child­hood. It is the na­ture of this abuse, more than any­thing else that seems to be at the core of how and why some of them be­come pros­ti­tutes. I am not psy­chol­o­gist but I imagine that the re­sults of the trauma they ex­pe­ri­enced dur­ing the abuse come out as un­healthy sex­ual re­la­tion­ships and sex­ual habits thus lead­ing to pros­ti­tu­tion. These are the peo­ple most likely to be ad­dicted to drugs as well be­cause of these un­der­ly­ing is­sues and are more likely to de­velop, or al­ready have, se­ri­ous health prob­lems. That is such a sad story and if it does not prove the strug­gle that is be­hind some women be­ing in this sit­u­a­tion, I do not know what will. An­other com­mon rea­son to pros­ti­tu­tion is sex traf­fick­ing. We hear about it on the news and watch doc­u­men­taries on it but for some rea­son it re­mains myth­i­cal. Sex traf­fick­ing is hu­man traf­fick­ing for the pur­pose of sex­ual ex­ploita­tion, in­clud­ing sex­ual slav­ery. A vic­tim is forced, in one of a va­ri­ety of ways, into a sit­u­a­tion of de­pen­dency on their traf­ficker and then is used to give sex­ual ser­vices to cus­tomers. I came across an ar­ti­cle that ex­plained that women in Zim­babwe’s bor­der towns like Beitbridge, Plumtree, Vic­to­ria Falls and Mutare are more sus­cep­ti­ble to be­ing lured to the neigh­bour­ing coun­tries for sex work whilst women, girls and men and boys are lured to as far as China and Egypt un­der false em­ploy­ment prom­ises only to find them­selves be­ing sex­u­ally ex­ploited. Imagine hav­ing no fam­ily or friends and no money in a coun­try whose lan­guage you do not un­der­stand and whose ge­og­ra­phy is just for­eign! How scary is that? It is only un­til we cease judg­ment and/or stereo­typ­ing and take the time to ap­pre­ci­ate that the prob­lem is not sim­ple or generic and un­der­stand the real rea­sons be­hind a woman’s de­ci­sion to trade her body for cash that we will be able to for­mu­late a so­lu­tion to end­ing pros­ti­tu­tion. That is if end­ing it is even pos­si­ble.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190706,The power of dig­i­tal me­dia in wildlife con­ser­va­tion,"WILDLIFE films can be a pow­er­ful tool in rais­ing aware­ness of con­ser­va­tion and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues. Apart from the en­ter­tain­ment value peo­ple get, the films can help cre­ate de­bate and in­spire a pos­i­tive change that can help con­serve Africa’s wildlife her­itage which is un­der se­vere pres­sure from poach­ing and the il­le­gal trade in wildlife and wildlife prod­ucts. Re­cently, the Univer­sity of Zim­babwe fac­ulty of sci­ence in part­ner­ship with the African Wildlife Foun­da­tion (AWF) pre­mièred ‘‘Sides of a Horn,” a short wildlife film that cap­tures rivet­ing scenes of poach­ing and the is­sues that drive it in most African com­mu­ni­ties rich in wildlife re­sources. The film was launched to help bring the story to the global au­di­ence through the power of story telling and di­a­logue. “This film demon­strates the po­ten­tial and power of the dig­i­tal me­dia in fight­ing wildlife crimes,” says Pa­tience Gandiwa, a se­nior of­fi­cial of the Zim­babwe Parks and Wildlife Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity. “There has been very lit­tle in­vest­ment in the dig­i­tal me­dia to cre­ate mes­sages that pro­mote con­ser­va­tion and make peo­ple to ap­pre­ci­ate the value of their wildlife her­itage.” The award win­ning short dra­matic film was writ­ten and di­rected by Toby Wosskow from ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer Richard Bran­son. It was filmed in South African town­ships and is pre­dom­i­nantly in Zulu with English sub­ti­tles. The 17 – minute film ex­plores the il­le­gal rhino horn trade, specif­i­cally look­ing at how com­mu­nity and fam­ily dy­nam­ics are dis­rupted when two broth­ers find them­selves on op­po­site sides of the poach­ing cri­sis. “Sides of a Horn is thought pro­vok­ing. It ex­plores the real is­sues be­hind the il­le­gal wildlife trade and makes it abun­dantly clear that we need to put that much more ef­fort to­wards pro­tect­ing this iconic species and en­sure that lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties can fully ben­e­fit from their wildlife and wild lands,” says AWF chief ex­ec­u­tive Kaddu Se­bunya. AWF has in­vested heav­ily in rhino con­ser­va­tion across the African con­ti­nent. Some of the projects that AWF has sup­ported in­clude rhino sanc­tu­ar­ies in South Africa, Namibia, Zim­babwe and Kenya. In March last year, the last re­main­ing north­ern white rhino in the world died, leav­ing the sub-species fac­ing ex­tinc­tion. Black rhi­nos, are crit­i­cally endangered and the AWF es­ti­mates that only 5 050 black rhi­nos re­main in the wild to­day, down from a pop­u­la­tion of 65 000 in 1964. The show­ing of the movie at the UZ gen­er­ated in­ter­est and pro­voked de­bate on poach­ing and wildlife con­ser­va­tion is­sues. UZ en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist and re­searcher, Pro­fes­sor Christo­pher Ma­gadza says poach­ing still con­tin­ues un­abated in most ar­eas ad­ja­cent to game sanc­tu­ar­ies be­cause the Communal Ar­eas Man­age­ment Pro­gramme for In­dige­nous Re­sources (CAMP­FIRE) - a Zim­bab­wean com­mu­nity-based nat­u­ral re­source man­age­ment ini­tia­tive had failed to ad­dress in­di­vid­ual poverty. “The sys­tem failed to ad­dress in­di­vid­ual poverty in ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties,” he says. “Only pri­vate con­ser­van­cies and ru­ral district coun­cils are ben­e­fit­ing. Lo­cals are not ben­e­fit­ing. Yes, clin­ics and schools have been built, but how do you ad­dress the needs of some­one who needs food, school fees and cloth­ing or money to get treat­ment? “In­di­vid­ual poverty still per­sist and it has not been ad­dressed by the Camp­fire ini­tia­tive. Lo­cals still have no say in how the wildlife is man­aged. They have no say in how they should ben­e­fit.” Lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties, he says, have been the big­gest losers in the con­flicts be­tween com­mu­ni­ties and wildlife re­sult­ing in loss of prop­erty,crops and life. The con­flicts be­tween the rangers and com­mu­ni­ties and that be­tween Zim­paks and Ru­ral District Coun­cils has also com­pounded the prob­lems. The con­flict re­volves around hunt­ing quo­tas and shar­ing of sport hunt­ing pro­ceeds. Se­bunya says apart from the need to ben­e­fit from wildlife re­sources, greater em­pha­sis should also be placed in tak­ing pride in Africa’s wildlife her­itage. “There is so much ob­ses­sion about ben­e­fits. Ben­e­fits from our wildlife should not be about money only. Not all of us are go­ing to ben­e­fit. We are not go­ing to ben­e­fit or sur­vive if the wildlife and the en­vi­ron­ment don’t sur­vive,” he says. “Con­ser­va­tion should not be an end to it­self. We need to ask our­selves what is the ben­e­fit of the wildlife to our ecosys­tem. A huge ben­e­fit to us is our ecosys­tem. The wildlife de­fines who we are as Africans, its part of us.” He says ed­u­ca­tion, in­volve­ment, di­a­logue and en­gage­ment of lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties is crit­i­cal in all ef­forts to save the wildlife. Yolanda Mutin­hima, of the Global Youth Bio­di­ver­sity Net­work says there was need for youth in­volve­ment in wildlife con­ser­va­tion mat­ters as well as im­prov­ing lo­cal par­tic­i­pa­tion in wildlife con­ser­va­tion ef­forts. “Lo­cal peo­ple are alien­ated from be­ing the cus­to­di­ans of their wildlife. They are not ben­e­fit­ing and this tends to drive up poach­ing,” she says. “Lo­cal com­mu­nity par­tic­i­pa­tion and you in­volve­ment is quite im­por­tant.” Zim­babwe and most other African coun­tries are fac­ing an un­prece­dented spike in poach­ing and il­le­gal wildlife trade which is threat­en­ing to dec­i­mate the con­ti­nent’s rich wildlife re­source base. Poach­ing is threat­en­ing the sur­vival of ele­phants, rhi­nos, chee­tahs, lions, hip­pos and a whole list of other an­i­mals still found on the con­ti­nent. Wildlife crime is now preva­lent across Africa with a com­plex web of highly dan­ger­ous in­ter­na­tional net­works. Wildlife and an­i­mal parts are be­ing traf­ficked to var­i­ous parts of the world. The poach­ing of ele­phants for ivory and other wild an­i­mals for their skins and bones has taken on new and deadly di­men­sions, with poachers us­ing chem­i­cals such as cyanide to poi­son wildlife. Count­less other species such as tur­tles, pan­golins, snakes and other wild plants and an­i­mals are be­ing caught or har­vested from the wild and then sold to buy­ers who make food, pets, or­na­men­tal plants, leather, tourist or­na­ments and medicine. Tusk Trust, a wildlife or­gan­i­sa­tion, re­ports that 100 000 ele­phants were killed in the past few years, leav­ing a pop­u­la­tion of about 400 000 — half what it was more than two-and-half decades ago. Ram­pant poach­ing in the sub-Sa­ha­ran range has re­sulted in the deaths of 100 000 ele­phants from 2011 to 2013, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Union for Con­ser­va­tion of Na­ture. Tan­za­nia’s ele­phant pop­u­la­tion plum­meted by 60 per­cent to 43 330 in the five years end­ing in 2014, ac­cord­ing to the Great Ele­phant Cen­sus, car­ried out by a coali­tion of wildlife groups while Mozam­bique lost half its ele­phants in the same pe­riod, fall­ing to 10 300. Wildlife cam­paign­ers say the sta­tis­tics “un­der­score the toxic mix of de­ter­mined crim­i­nal gangs, cor­rupt govern­ment of­fi­cials and a strong mar­ket for smug­gled ivory in Asia — par­tic­u­larly in China — which has deep­ened its eco­nomic ties to Africa in re­cent years.” An­other round cyanide poi­son­ings in Zim­babwe killed 14 ele­phants in Septem­ber 2015 while 26 more were found poi­soned at two sites in the Hwange Na­tional Park, ac­cord­ing to the Zim­babwe Parks and Wildlife Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity. In 2013, cyanide poi­son­ing dec­i­mated about 300 ele­phants in Hwange as poachers placed salt laced with cyanide near wildlife wa­ter­ing holes. This has had rip­ple ef­fects on the ecosys­tem, killing other an­i­mals too, in­clud­ing preda­tors feed­ing off the ele­phant car­casses. Zim­babwe has one of Africa’s big­gest sur­viv­ing ele­phant pop­u­la­tions and Hwange Na­tional Park is home to half of the coun­try’s es­ti­mated 100 000 ele­phants that are thought to live in this pro­tected area, west of the coun­try. The coun­try has an ele­phant pop­u­la­tion of about 100 000 against a car­ry­ing ca­pac­ity of 40 000. Zim­parks au­thor­i­ties blame over­pop­u­la­tion, in­ad­e­quate fund­ing and man­power for the spike in ele­phant poach­ing in con­ser­va­tion spots dot­ted around the coun­try. De­spite all the woes fac­ing Africa’s wildlife sec­tor, Mr Se­bunya said the sur­vival of the con­ti­nent’s wildlife will de­pend on whether Africa and its lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties ben­e­fit from it or not. “Africa needs to ben­e­fit first and fore­most from the sus­tain­able ex­ploita­tion of its wildlife re­sources,” he says. “It is not about stop­ping the traf­fick­ing of wildlife prod­ucts such as rhino but Africans need to fig­ure out how to ben­e­fit from their wildlife. There must be a ben­e­fit from con­serv­ing rhi­nos and ele­phants, it must be ex­plained.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170922,BRICS needs a new ap­proach,"Achiev­ing a just and eq­ui­table in­ter­na­tional economic or­der re­quires govern­ments to take se­ri­ously their com­mit­ment to pro­tect and pro­mote hu­man rights as set out in the UN Char­ter and other hu­man rights treaties. THE for­ma­tion of BRICS — the bloc made up of Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa — was sup­posed to be the har­bin­ger for a new ap­proach to global economic gov­er­nance. The lead­ing emerg­ing mar­kets and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries were be­com­ing ma­jor play­ers in the global econ­omy. And they ex­pected to play a com­men­su­rate gov­er­nance role. BRICS lead­ers have now been meet­ing an­nu­ally for nine years. They re­cently met for the ninth BRICS Sum­mit in Xi­a­men, China. They have po­si­tioned them­selves as a force for trans­form­ing global economic gov­er­nance so that it’s more re­spon­sive to the con­cerns of de­vel­op­ing economies. They are seek­ing a more just and eq­ui­table global econ­omy. The ques­tion is: how ef­fec­tive have they been in re­form­ing global economic gov­er­nance and the fair­ness of the global econ­omy? The hon­est an­swer is that as a group, BRICS hasn’t been an ef­fec­tive force at all. This is for a num­ber of rea­sons. What’s not hap­pened The fol­low­ing ex­am­ples il­lus­trate the point. At least for­mally the G20, which con­sists of 20 ma­jor economies in­clud­ing the five in BRICs, has sup­planted the G7, made up of Canada, France, Ger­many, Italy, Ja­pan, the UK and the US, as the premier fo­rum for global economic gov­er­nance. But the agenda in th­ese meet­ings is still largely set by the most pow­er­ful coun­tries which now in­clude China but not the other BRICS. The IMF and World Bank have both changed their vot­ing ar­range­ments to give a louder voice to de­vel­op­ing economies and emerg­ing economies. This has par­tic­u­larly ben­e­fited China, In­dia and Brazil. But BRICS hasn’t sup­ported South Africa’s call for a third African seat on the board of the IMF. This has left Africa as the most un­der­rep­re­sented re­gion on the board. BRICS coun­tries, to­gether with other G20 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, have be­come more active par­tic­i­pants in or­gan­i­sa­tions re­spon­si­ble for de­vel­op­ing in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tory stan­dards. This means that they now can par­tic­i­pate in the writ­ing of stan­dards that guide the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial sys­tem. But the sys­tem con­tin­ues to be more re­spon­sive to the in­ter­ests of the rich and pow­er­ful than those of the de­vel­op­ing world. New in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have been cre­ated, in­clud­ing the BRICS’ New De­vel­op­ment Bank and the Con­tin­gent Re­serve Ar­range­ment, which pro­vides fi­nan­cial sup­port for BRICS coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing bal­ance of pay­ments prob­lems. Un­for­tu­nately, the New De­vel­op­ment Bank op­er­ates in a less trans­par­ent and less ac­count­able way than other mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment banks. For ex­am­ple, it’s harder for out­siders to ac­cess in­for­ma­tion on the op­er­a­tional poli­cies and practices of the bank than those of the World Bank or the African De­vel­op­ment Bank. Unlike those other banks, there isn’t yet a mech­a­nism to hold the New De­vel­op­ment Bank ac­count­able if it causes harm. The New De­vel­op­ment Bank also risks re­peat­ing the tragic mis­takes of th­ese other in­sti­tu­tions, which for many years con­cen­trated only on economic is­sues in their op­er­a­tional de­ci­sion mak­ing. Fol­low­ing a num­ber of scan­dals they be­gan to pay more at­ten­tion to the so­cial, hu­man rights and en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact of their op­er­a­tions. Mem­bers of the New De­vel­op­ment Bank seem to share this con­cern. The BRICS lead­ers have re­it­er­ated their com­mit­ment to achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in its three di­men­sions — economic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal — in a bal­anced and in­te­grated man­ner. But it’s hard to see how they ex­pect the bank to meet this com­mit­ment if it con­tin­ues to place more em­pha­sis on speed in project im­ple­men­ta­tion than on iden­ti­fy­ing and man­ag­ing the ad­verse en­vi­ron­men­tal, hu­man rights and so­cial ef­fects of its projects. To ful­fil their com­mit­ment to pro­mote a more just and eq­ui­table global econ­omy the BRICS will need to up their game. How to fix the prob­lem Achiev­ing a just and eq­ui­table in­ter­na­tional economic or­der re­quires govern­ments to take se­ri­ously their com­mit­ment to pro­tect and pro­mote hu­man rights as set out in the UN Char­ter and other hu­man rights treaties. The start­ing point is a com­mit­ment to re­spect and pro­mote the rights of each in­di­vid­ual af­fected by each project, pro- gramme or pol­icy that govern­ments un­der­take or sup­port. This re­quires de­vel­op­ing a good sys­tem to fore­cast the im­pact of a project on the en­vi­ron­ment, so­ci­ety as well as hu­man rights. And to have a plan to man­age them. An­other el­e­ment is ac­count­abil­ity. Any per­son ad­versely af­fected by a project should have ac­cess to a mech­a­nism that can pro­vide them with an ef­fec­tive rem­edy. Fi­nally, the rel­e­vant de­ci­sion-mak­ers must be able to show how their pro­posed ac­tiv­ity is us­ing the max­i­mum avail­able hu­man and fi­nan­cial re­sources to ful­fil the hu­man rights of all the peo­ple af­fected by their de­ci­sions. This sug­gests that the rel­e­vant de­ci­sion-mak­ers bear the bur­den of ex­plain­ing why the pro­posed al­lo­ca­tions are the most fea­si­ble. This in­cludes govern­ments, in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions as well as pri­vate par­ties. There are rea­sons to think the BRICS lead­ers could be per­suaded to adopt a hu­man rights based ap­proach to mak­ing global economic gov­er­nance more demo­cratic and re­spon­sive to the needs of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and for a more just, eq­ui­table and sus­tain­able global econ­omy. They, and their col­leagues in other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, are gov­ern­ing so­ci­eties with con­tin­u­ing, and some cases wors­en­ing poverty, in­equal­ity, un­em­ploy­ment and en­vi­ron­men­tal degra­da­tion lev­els. And they don’t seem to have an ef­fec­tive strat­egy for meet­ing this chal­lenge. — Con­ver­sa­tion Africa. ◆ Danny Bradlow, SARCHI Pro­fes­sor of In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Law and African Economic Re­la­tions, Univer­sity of Pre­to­ria",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201208,Ad­dress­ing land in­equal­ity key to tack­ling food se­cu­rity,"LAND has since time im­memo­rial re­mained an emo­tive and sen­si­tive is­sue. Even up to now, land ten­ure se­cu­rity and ac­cess are still a burn­ing is­sue, not only in Zim­babwe, but in Africa and all over the world. The lat­est re­port, pro­duced by the tech­ni­cal spe­cial­ists at the In­ter­na­tional Land Coali­tion in part­ner­ship with Ox­fam and the World In­equal­ity Lab, shows the grow­ing gap and im­pact of land own­er­ship con­cen­tra­tion into the hands of a few. Ma­jor high­lights of the re­port in­clude the fact that the top 10 per­cent of the ru­ral pop­u­la­tion now owns or con­trols 60 per­cent of agri­cul­tural land value while the ma­jor­ity of the poor — in the lower half con­trols only three per­cent. Pub­lish­ers of the re­port say this land in­equal­ity con­tin­ues to threaten the liveli­hoods of an es­ti­mated 2,5 bil­lion peo­ple in­volved in small­holder agri­cul­ture. Ac­cord­ing to a new re­port from the Land In­equal­ity Ini­tia­tive, there is grow­ing in­equal­ity in terms of land own­er­ship based on the size and value of land that peo­ple have ac­cess to or hold, level of se­cu­rity of ten­ure that peo­ple have, ac­tual con­trol that peo­ple have in­clud­ing their de­ci­sion-mak­ing power over land and con­trol of the ben­e­fits from the land. Land in­equal­ity has tossed the ma­jor­ity of the poor into poverty and food in­se­cu­rity at a time when the world is also wit­ness­ing sharp gaps when it comes to eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal, so­cial, spa­tial and en­vi­ron­men­tal in­equal­ity. Re­searchers in this lat­est study found out that con­trol over the land has be­come far more con­cen­trated both di­rectly through own­er­ship and in­di­rectly through con­tract farm­ing, which re­sults in the loss of agri­cul­tural bio­di­ver­sity. Mono­cul­ture and the rise of small­hold­ings, is seen as be­ing de­struc­tive to crop di­ver­sity which is crit­i­cal to cli­mate re­silience. An­other glar­ing pointer is a wor­ry­ing trend show­ing that land in­equal­ity is 41 per­cent higher than pre­vi­ously thought, some­thing that in­di­cates the ris­ing num­ber of land­less pop­u­la­tions world­wide. This study which was re­leased to­wards the end of Novem­ber 2020, is based on 17 new re­search pa­pers as well as anal­y­sis of ex­ist­ing data and lit­er­a­ture. Data from the re­port shows that global land con­cen­tra­tion has in­creased con­tin­u­ously since the 1980s with the largest one per­cent of farms in the world op­er­at­ing more than 70 per­cent of the world’s farm­land. The Land In­equal­ity Ini­tia­tive re­port showed that land­less­ness was low­est in China and Viet­nam while it is high­est in Latin Amer­ica where the ma­jor­ity of the poor who con­sti­tute 50 per­cent of peo­ple owned just one per­cent of the land. Asia and Africa have the high­est lev­els of small­hold­ings, where hu­man in­put tends to be higher than chem­i­cal and me­chan­i­cal fac­tors and where time frames are more likely to be for gen­er­a­tions rather than 10-year in­vest­ment cy­cles. World­wide, be­tween 80 per­cent and 90 per­cent of farms are fam­ily or small­holder-owned and only cover a small and shrink­ing part of the land and com­mer­cial pro­duc­tion, ac­cord­ing to the re­searchers. The United States and Europe, ex­pe­ri­enced the big­gest shift from small­holder to big farm hold­ings over the past decades. Land own­er­ship in these two re­gions is in fewer hands and even in­di­vid­ual farm­ers work un­der strict con­tracts for re­tail­ers, giant trad­ing con­glom­er­ates and in­vest­ment funds. Ex­perts say these fi­nan­cial ar­range­ments are now spread­ing to the de­vel­op­ing world, which is ac­cel­er­at­ing the de­cline of soil qual­ity, the overuse of wa­ter re­sources, and the pace of de­for­esta­tion. “The con­cen­tra­tion of own­er­ship and con­trol re­sults in a greater push for mono­cul­tures and more in­ten­sive agri­cul­ture as in­vest­ment funds tend to work on 10-year cy­cles to gen­er­ate re­turns,” Ward Anseeuw, se­nior tech­ni­cal spe­cial­ist at the In­ter­na­tional Land Coali­tion, was quoted in the me­dia say­ing. The tech­ni­cal ex­perts warn of the grow­ing and over­rid­ing in­flu­ence of mar­ket forces which are weak­en­ing the ca­pac­ity of farm­ers to pro­tect crop bio­di­ver­sity and the qual­ity of farm soil. The re­port rec­om­mends greater reg­u­la­tion and over­sight of opaque land own­er­ship sys­tems, a shift in tax regimes to sup­port small­holder farm­ers and bet­ter en­vi­ron­men­tal man­age­ment and great sup­port for the land rights of lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties. “Small­holder farm­ers, fam­ily farm­ers, indige­nous peo­ple and small com­mu­ni­ties are much more cau­tious with use of land. “It’s not just about re­turn on in­vest­ment, it’s about cul­ture, iden­tity and leav­ing some­thing for the next gen­er­a­tion. They take much more care and in the long run, they pro­duce more per unit area and de­stroy less,” says Anseeuw. Land in­equal­ity for Africa means in­creased food in­se­cu­rity for the ma­jor­ity of the poor. The con­ti­nent re­mains a huge net food im­porter, at a cost of more than $47 bil­lion in 2018. Covid-19 re­stric­tions have com­pounded Africa’s food se­cu­rity po­si­tion. It has trig­gered higher lost in­come, as un­sold and rot­ting food ac­cu­mu­lates on farms. That was not what the African Union hoped for when in 2013 it adopted its Agenda 2063. Good land gov­er­nance is widely seen as an an­chor to its as­pi­ra­tions and strate­gic goals of the Agenda 2063 blueprint. Agri­cul­tural an­a­lysts say to de­crease food im­por­ta­tion and es­ca­lat­ing food prices, the im­ple­men­ta­tion of AU’s Dec­la­ra­tion on Land Is­sues and Chal­lenges at re­gional and na­tional lev­els is im­per­a­tive. In ad­di­tion, they say pro­cesses such as the Frame­work and Guide­lines on Land Pol­icy in Africa, the Vol­un­tary Guide­lines on the Re­spon­si­ble Gov­er­nance of Ten­ure of Land, Fish­eries and Forests in Con­text of Na­tional Food Se­cu­rity (VGGT), and the AU Guid­ing Prin­ci­ples on Large Scale Land Based In­vest­ments in Africa (LSLBI) pro­vide the con­ti­nent with in­stru­ments to make land a key driver of eco­nomic pros­per­ity. In many African coun­tries, it is worth­while to note that men and women have in­ad­e­quate ac­cess to se­cure rights over land, with women be­ing par­tic­u­larly dis­ad­van­taged. The In­ter­na­tional Land Coali­tion-Africa’s re­cent statis­tics re­veal that while women con­sti­tute 70 per­cent of the ac­tive ru­ral pop­u­la­tion and 80 per­cent of food pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity in Sene­gal (and most of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa), only 13 per­cent have ac­cess to land and 2,6 per­cent hold se­cure land ten­ure rights. Fur­ther­more, 61,2 per­cent of women say that lack of re­sources deep­ens in­equal­ity on ac­cess to land. Ad­dress­ing land in­equal­i­ties and dis­par­i­ties on land is­sues is a crit­i­cal step to ad­dress­ing food and nutri­tion in­se­cu­rity in Africa. Tack­ling the grow­ing men­ace of land barons who are sell­ing ru­ral land and other land on the pe­riph­ery of ur­ban ar­eas to des­per­ate peo­ple, is also vi­tal to se­cure small­holder farm lands and en­sure African coun­tries have ad­e­quate food. In the end, such re­ports as that of the Land In­equal­ity Ini­tia­tive, should pro­vide some use­ful in­sight and strate­gies for man­ag­ing our land re­form process here in Zim­babwe. It might be seen as re­mote, but it could prove strate­gic in fu­ture as we strug­gle to re­dis­tribute the land amongst our­selves as new land own­ers in the coun­try.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20200710,From a sacked Moyo to a sur­real nutty pro­fes­sor,"OBA­DIAH Moyo was in cel­e­bra­tory mood this week af­ter he was in­formed that, fi­nally, he had been re­lieved of the bur­den of hav­ing to take care of the na­tion’s health. It was clear the man was not en­joy­ing his job. Ev­ery time he ap­peared on Dead BC, he looked like some­one they had dragged from the early-open­ing bar round the cor­ner and made him a whole cab­i­net min­is­ter. Surely, the man was hap­pier at Chi­tung­wiza Hospi­tal, pri­vatis­ing health ser­vices and pre­tend­ing to be a doc­tor in peace. Now that they made him a min­is­ter, he sud­denly had to keep pre­tend­ing he knew any­thing about medicine. He sud­denly had re­porters sniff­ing around his empty cer­tifi­cate cab­i­net. So, bored by all of it, he al­legedly de­cided to have some fun by putting his hands in the cookie jar, just for en­ter­tain­ment. He is also now tak­ing the fall for al­low­ing those linked to higher au­thor­i­ties to share in the prof­its of Zim­babwe’s world-class health care. In a state­ment, Chief Sec­re­tary Misheck Sibanda an­nounced that Moyo had been fired “for con­duct in­ap­pro­pri­ate for a gov­ern­ment min­is­ter”. e con­duct be­ing re­ferred to is not cor­rup­tion.  at is al­lowed. It is the very bad con­duct of be­ing caught do­ing it. We do not ex­pect such con­duct from Zanu PF. Cheers for Mo­hadi FOR decades, schol­ars have flocked to Zim­babwe to try and un­der­stand why the coun­try is such an ut­ter fail­ure.  ou­sands of books and co­pi­ous amounts of aca­demic drivel have been spent on try­ing to un­der­stand the never-end­ing cri­sis. All the ques­tions have now been an­swered, thanks to Kembo Mo­hadi, the na­tion’s most fa­mous ax­e­man. Speak­ing to some vil­lagers, Mo­hadi said the coun­try was a mess be­cause the whites left with­out telling us how to run the econ­omy. “We got our in­de­pen­dence, but the white man never gave us knowl­edge on how to run our econ­omy.  at was it, noth­ing more than that,” Mo­hadi said. We are sure there were loud cheers af­ter this rev­e­la­tion. All this while, we thought we were poor be­cause of cor­rup­tion and in­com­pe­tence. Now it turns out it is be­cause the whites did not hold sem­i­nars to teach us how to run the coun­try. For 40 years, we still have not fig­ured out how a coun­try is run. Some of us were too busy swing­ing axes at wives to learn ba­sic eco­nomics. Fos­sil Sikhosana WHILE nurses are on strike, the Health Ser­vices Board (HSB) chair­per­son, the fos­sil Pauli­nus Sikhosana, said the com­mis­sion had re­ceived Land Rover Dis­cov­ery 6 ve­hi­cles for the board. “ e HSB con­di­tions of ser­vice for board mem­bers are stan­dard for those of other com­mis­sion­ers,” Sikhosana said while ap­pear­ing be­fore the Na­tional Assem­bly. Mean­while, in the hos­pi­tals, nurses are shar­ing cab­bages and fail­ing to save pa­tients for lack of ba­sic equip­ment and medicine. For all the love for China, Zim­bab­wean po­lit­i­cal elites have learnt noth­ing from that coun­try. e fa­mous Chi­nese philoso­pher Con­fu­cius once said this: “In a coun­try well gov­erned, poverty is some­thing to be ashamed of. In a coun­try badly gov­erned, wealth is some­thing to be ashamed of.” Which is why even the “all­weather friends” get em­bar­rassed when they see Zim­bab­wean chefs sweat­ing and heav­ing their large frames into lux­ury cars. Ar­rest­ing nurses MEAN­WHILE, still at hos­pi­tals, the gov­ern­ment fi­nally found an in­no­va­tive so­lu­tion to end­ing the nurses’ strike.  e so­lu­tion is to ar­rest the strik­ing nurses. It is a ge­nius plan. You can­not have a nurses’ strike, if you no longer have nurses. By get­ting rid of nurses, you also get rid of strikes.  ere has been no bet­ter or brainier idea than that in the his­tory of gover­nance. is is why we saw poor po­lice of­fi­cers be­ing set on poor nurses.  is way, hos­pi­tals will sud­denly fill up with medicines and mod­ern equip­ment, staff will be­come happy with their pay, and Zanu PF’s cam­paign prom­ise of world­class health­care for all will mag­i­cally come to fruition. Ne­handa statue IT was an­nounced this week that the gov­ern­ment is to build a statue of Mbuya Ne­handa in the cen­tre of Harare. is is good news for the econ­omy.  e con­struc­tion of that statue is ob­vi­ously all that we needed for the econ­omy to re­cover. True pa­tri­ots must ig­nore loud cries from third-rate pas­tors who see the statue as a form of “oc­cult wor­ship”. Do these pas­tors not have Cau­casian idols in their own churches? As for peo­ple scream­ing about pri­or­i­ties, is there ever a bet­ter time to build things so that we can wear our scarves in the sun, cut rib­bons and make speeches? Be­sides, our “all-weather friends” will spare some time from the new Par­lia­ment build­ing, which they are build­ing for free, to build this statue for us, again for free. Let us not be dis­tracted. Fo­cus should, in­stead, be on the fact that the Ne­handa statue will de­liver us from cor­rup­tion and in­com­pe­tence. A statue is what the na­tion has been wait­ing for.  e haters must now watch as the dead econ­omy rises like the bones of Ne­handa her­self. “We got our in­de­pen­dence, but the white man never gave us knowl­edge on how to run our econ­omy.  at was it, noth­ing more than that.” Nutty pro­fes­sor FI­NANCE min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube has once again shown that they do not call him the nutty pro­fes­sor for noth­ing. Ncube, who claimed that he chose which of the vul­ner­a­ble house­holds af­fected by the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to give a pal­try ZW$200 (which is now less than US$2) through “so­phis­ti­cated al­go­rithms”, stunned his au­di­ence when he was asked by jour­nal­ists about the sus­pen­sion of trad­ing on the stock ex­change and the panic among in­vestors. e fi­nance min­is­ter said that in­vestors should not worry and treat the sus­pen­sion of the lo­cal bourse as a “long hol­i­day”. Such daft ut­ter­ances are the rea­son why his pleas for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance are turned down by in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. Who can trust such in­di­vid­u­als who ex­hibit such lev­els of lu­nacy with a fi­nan­cial bailout pack­age? To have such de­luded char­ac­ters run­ning Trea­sury ex­plains why the econ­omy is in such a ruinous state. When Ncube was ap­pointed, a busi­ness­man-turned-preacher said the chap was the best fi­nance min­is­ter the coun­try has ever had. Given the out­spo­ken pas­tor’s sting­ing crit­i­cism of gov­ern­ment these days, the man of the cloth must surely be eat­ing his own words. Cry the beloved na­tional purse!",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200729,High­ways of suc­cess tak­ing new shape,"MAS­SIVE roads re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion works be­ing car­ried out in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try are an epit­ome of the progress be­ing made by the New Dis­pen­sa­tion in its com­mit­ment to chang­ing the coun­try’s eco­nomic sta­tus. The work shows a sound un­der­stand­ing of the im­por­tant link be­tween a good road net­work and de­vel­op­ment. Without a good road net­work, it will be prac­ti­cally im­pos­si­ble to at­tract vis­i­tors such as tourists and in­vestors, both with the po­ten­tial to con­trib­ute im­mensely to the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try. It will also be dif­fi­cult for peo­ple to do busi­ness among them­selves lo­cally if they can­not travel eas­ily to the next des­ti­na­tion. Those who trav­elled along the Harare-Beit­bridge High­way in re­cent times will tes­tify of the enor­mous changes that have hap­pened to some sec­tions of the busy road, al­beit us­ing lo­cal fi­nan­cial re­sources. In many other sec­tions, de­tours have been cre­ated along the road, some run­ning for sev­eral kilo­me­tres, as the orig­i­nal tarred road is be­ing com­pletely re­moved. But this is not tak­ing place on the Harare-Beit­bridge High­way alone. Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion work is un­der­way on sec­tions of the Harare-Chirundu High­way, where en­gi­neers are em­ploy­ing the lat­est tech­nolo­gies in road con­struc­tion. Ja­pan ex­tended a US$21 mil­lion grant to the Gov­ern­ment of Zimbabwe for the road project aimed at im­prov­ing the steep gra­di­ents on the Makuti-Chirundu sec­tion of the North-South cor­ri­dor. The project is ex­pected to be a turn­ing point in road con­struc­tion and up­grade as the ex­ist­ing stretch of the road will see the ap­pli­ca­tion of the ce­ment-formed as­phalt sta­bilised-base tech­nol­ogy, which is ex­pected to cut costs and speed up road projects. Roads tar­geted for re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion or al­ready be­ing re­ha­bil­i­tated in Mata­bele­land South are: Gwanda- Maphisa, Maphisa- Mpo­engs, Gwanda-Guyu-Manama-Tuli, while in Mata­bele­land North they are DeteBinga Road and Binga-Karoi Road. In the Mid­lands, the roads are Mberengwa-West Ni­chol­son, Gokwe- Siyabuwa, Kwekwe- Nkayi, Mberengwa-Mataga, Jeka Bridge, Kwekwe-Gokwe and Ka­wonga Shelvert. Mashona­land East has Hwedza­Sadza, Mushandi­ra­pamwe-Hwedza, Beatrice-Mubaira, Zaire-Chin­gondo, and in Mashona­land Cen­tral the roads are Gu­ruve-Kanyemba and Mt Dar­win-Mukum­bura. In Mashona­land West, the roads be­ing worked on are Golden Val­ley-Sany­ati, Sky­line-Mubaira-Chegutu, Alaska-Cop­per Queen, Kirk­man Road. Masvingo has Kapota-Zimuto, Chi­longa Bridge, Gutu- Buhera, Mhan­damahwe-Chivi-Tokwe, Rutenga-Zvisha­vane, Chartsworth-Gutu, Rutenga-Boli-Chicualacuala. In Man­i­ca­land, the roads are Ngundu-Tan­ganda, Nya­man­gura Bridge, Mu­ram­binda-Birchenough, Nyanga-Ruwangwe, Odzi-Marange-Zviripiri, while Mata­bele­land North has Vic­to­ria Falls-Bu­l­awayo, Bu­l­awayo-Nkayi and Bu­l­awayo-Tsholot­sho. In re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing these roads, the New Dis­pen­sa­tion is pre­cisely on point be­cause roads act like veins which carry the eco­nomic pulse that leads to de­vel­op­ment. In fact, there is a huge cor­re­la­tion be­tween a good road net­work and de­vel­op­ment, and a coun­try well linked in­ter­nally and with other coun­tries is highly rated on the ease of do­ing busi­ness in­dex. The fact that Zimbabwe’s road net­work tran­scends na­tional bound­aries, and that the coun­try is land­locked, leads to the roads re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­gramme be­ing con­sid­ered within the re­gional de­vel­op­ment con­text. There are a lot of coun­tries north of the Lim­popo River which de­pend on lo­cal roads to trans­port their goods to sea ports in Mozam­bique, South Africa and Namibia. When in­vestors in­tent to in­vest in a coun­try, one of the ar­eas they are likely to con­sider is the state of the road net­work. The in­vestors will be think­ing about how they will be able to ac­cess lo­cal and re­gional mar­kets, and how they will get peo­ple con­nected to their projects. They will also be con­cerned about how they will move their goods out of the coun­try, es­pe­cially if they in­volved in ex­port ori­ented projects. This means a good and reliable road net­work is im­por­tant to the re­vival of the econ­omy in Zimbabwe, es­pe­cially when the coun­try is em­pha­sis­ing on at­tract­ing both lo­cal and for­eign in­vestors. The strong re­la­tion­ship be­tween a good road net­work and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment brings a pos­i­tive vibe to any­one with money who might want to in­vest it in the coun­try. Emerg­ing economies in other parts of the world have used state-of-the-art road net­works as a mar­ket­ing point for the at­trac­tion of in­vestors. The road net­works are act­ing as a back-up to the in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion of the par­tic­u­lar coun­tries, es­pe­cially those re­ferred to as the Asian tigers, and China. In­dus­tries deal­ing in per­ish­ables like fish and hor­ti­cul­tural prod­ucts would feel at easy if the coun­try’s road net­work is ex­cel­lent and well con­nected with other coun­tries. As is en­vis­aged un­der Vi­sion 2030 of achiev­ing an up­per mid­dle in­come econ­omy, Zimbabwe has em­barked on an in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion process, and a good net­work will com­ple­ment this de­vel­op­men­tal tra­jec­tory. Raw ma­te­ri­als will need to be moved, es­pe­cially from farm­ing ar­eas to the in­dus­tries, and this can­not be done ef­fi­ciently without a good road net­work. Peo­ple in ru­ral ar­eas will also ben­e­fit im­mensely as goods can eas­ily be moved from pro­duc­tion cen­tres, thus help­ing bridge the gap that ex­ist be­tween them and ur­ban ar­eas. This will lead to a re­duc­tion in poverty, as many peo­ple in marginalised ar­eas are able to par­tic­i­pate and reap the ben­e­fits of eco­nomic progress. This is why it is im­por­tant that the Gov­ern­ment pro­gramme on road re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion is touch­ing on roads in all parts of the coun­try, in­clud­ing those in dis­tricts. An all-in­clu­sive econ­omy is be­ing cre­ated through the roads re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­gramme, which will re­sult in peo­ple eas­ily par­tic­i­pat­ing in de­vel­op­men­tal ac­tiv­i­ties be­cause of easy move­ment. There is a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage that comes with a good road net­work as goods are moved eas­ily, lead­ing to the growth of other sec­tors like agri­cul­ture and in­dus­try and trade. The roads re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­gramme is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s in­fras­truc­ture de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme that will re­vamp the coun­try to new stan­dards of do­ing busi­ness. A coun­try with a good in­fras­truc­ture has a solid base for start­ing its de­vel­op­men­tal jour­ney. As part of the South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC) Pro­to­col on Trans­port, Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, and Me­te­o­rol­ogy (1996), Zimbabwe is tak­ing a lead in re­form­ing its roads sec­tor in line with the as­pi­ra­tions of the re­gion. The pro­to­col com­pels mem­ber states to up their game in roads man­age­ment and main­te­nance, to en­sure easy ac­cess both lo­cally and re­gion­ally for the ben­e­fit of the econ­omy. Zimbabwe’s road net­work is about 88 133km, 14 000km of which are sur­faced, 50 000km are all-weather and the re­main­der are earth roads. The roads are clas­si­fied in re­la­tion to their func­tions. There are re­gional trunk roads which cover roughly 3 391km with 94 per­cent of them sur­faced. Se­condary roads and ter­tiary roads also make up the road net­work in Zimbabwe. Se­condary roads link re­gional, pri­mary, ter­tiary and ur­ban roads, in­dus­trial and min­ing cen­tres, mi­nor bor­ders and tourist at­trac­tions. Roads that pro­vide ac­cess to schools, health cen­tres, dip tanks and other fa­cil­i­ties in ru­ral dis­trict coun­cil ar­eas or link and give ac­cess to se­condary and re­gional roads are re­ferred to as ter­tiary roads. The road net­work is in­com­plete without bridges that en­able road and rail cross­ing of wa­ter­ways, fly­overs, in­ter­changes, road over road and road over rail. There are ap­prox­i­mately 1 051 bridges in Zimbabwe. ◆ lchiko­vahh@ya­hoo.com",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200630,Covid-19 pan­demic: Peo­ple’s life­styles changed world­wide,"THE Covid-19 pan­demic has brought panic, shock and un­prece­dented threats to hu­man sur­vival world­wide. The novel coro­n­avirus has at­tracted un­prece­dented mea­sures to curb its spread and sever­ity. Covid-19 was first dis­cov­ered in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and is caus­ing crit­i­cal chal­lenges for pub­lic health world­wide. The Covid-19 out­break has rapidly evolved into a fast-mov­ing global pan­demic, with world up­dates pro­duced on a daily ba­sis. The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) de­clared the out­break to be a Pub­lic Health Emer­gency of In­ter­na­tional Con­cern on Jan­uary 30, 2020. On March 11, 2020, the WHO de­clared Covid-19 a global pan­demic. Glob­ally, the num­ber of Covid-19 cases has reached more than seven mil­lion and killed close to a mil­lion. The first con­firmed case of Covid-19 in­fec­tion in the African re­gion was re­ported in Nige­ria on Fe­bru­ary 28. By April 1, 43 of the 46 Sub-Sa­ha­ran African coun­tries had re­ported con­firmed cases of Covid-19. Ac­cord­ing to WHO, Africa as a re­gion, has the world’s great­est con­cen­tra­tion of least de­vel­oped coun­tries, frag­ile and con­flict-af­fected states, mor­bid­ity, in­ad­e­quate hous­ing, and poor health­care. This is an in­di­ca­tion that most African na­tion­als are liv­ing in poverty and are likely to be more sus­cep­ti­ble to Covid-19 in­fec­tion, due to over­crowd­ing, poor san­i­ta­tion, food in­se­cu­rity and un­der nu­tri­tion, lack of ed­u­ca­tion and health lit­er­acy among oth­ers. Pre­vi­ous stud­ies have shown that pan­demics have dras­tic psy­choso­cial im­pacts, which even­tu­ally be­come more per­va­sive than the pan­demic it­self. Re­search shows that the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of quar­an­tine is wide-rang­ing, sub­stan­tial and can be long last­ing. Tak­ing into con­sid­er­a­tion the cur­rent lock­down sit­u­a­tion and Zim­babwe’s econ­omy stamina, it has dis­rupted so­cial sup­port net­works hence caus­ing more harm than good. The spread of covid-19 is ac­cel­er­at­ing rapidly in Zim­babwe and the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of Covid19 is scant. The gov­ern­ment re­sponded pos­i­tively by ini­tially an­nounc­ing a na­tion­wide to­tal lock­down for 21 days start­ing on March 30, which was later ex­tended in­def­i­nitely as a mea­sure to pre­vent and mit­i­gate the spread of Covid-19. The di­rec­tive re­stric­tive mea­sures by the gov­ern­ment has caused anger, frus­tra­tion, sad­ness, panic, anx­i­ety and a high rise of do­mes­tic vi­o­lence in dif­fer­ent com­mu­ni­ties. Cul­tur­ally, Zim­babwe is a col­lec­tive com­mu­nity in which the “be­ing-ness” of in­di­vid­u­als is de­fined by in­ter­ac­tion. There­fore, the pub­lic so­cial dis­tance has af­fected the norms and val­ues of Ubuntu. Re­search in­di­cates that pan­demics such as the Covid19 can re­duce qual­ity of life, eco­nomic pro­duc­tiv­ity and paral­yse so­cial sys­tems. In Zim­babwe, the first case was recorded in Vic­to­ria Falls, the tourist hub and cash cow for gov­ern­ment rev­enue. The Vic­to­ria Falls re­gion has for the long­est time also strug­gled with one of the high­est HIV preva­lence rates in the coun­try. Hav­ing the first case recorded in Vic­to­ria Falls did not come as a sur­prise with the thou­sands of in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals the town has each day. Vic­to­ria Falls re­mains one of the most vul­ner­a­ble towns to be highly im­pacted by the pan­demic with a pop­u­la­tion of over 40 000 peo­ple who all con­verge for shop­ping from two ma­jor su­per­mar­kets and one bus ter­mi­nus. With an in­creas­ing short­age of ba­sic food sup­plies, su­per­mar­kets are flooded with peo­ple queu­ing for ba­sic com­modi­ties, which ex­pose them to the dan­ger of in­fec­tion. Vic­to­ria Falls used to be a hive of ac­tiv­ity rang­ing from craft­work, cul­tural dance groups, vil­lage tours, town­ship tours and vend­ing among oth­ers. The Covid-19 lock­down and slow­down has pushed Vic­to­ria Falls into mucky-wa­ters. Tourism is the en­gine that runs the town from ser­vice de­liv­ery, eco­nomic devel­op­ment, ed­u­ca­tion and so­cial wel­fare. The ad­vent of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has left Vic­to­ria Falls in a dire sit­u­a­tion with thou­sands of peo­ple los­ing their jobs and source of liveli­hoods. Covid-19 has caused panic and fear among the res­i­dents re­sult­ing in mul­ti­ple ef­fects such as the un­cer­tain­ties with their liveli­hoods, not be­ing able to work dur­ing iso­la­tion, fear of be­ing dis­missed from work, fear of be­ing sep­a­rated from loved ones, feel­ings of hope­less­ness, bore­dom, fear of death, lone­li­ness and de­pres­sion due to iso­la­tion. Ac­cord­ing to WHO, the ef­fects of Covid-19 dif­fer ac­cord­ing to na­tions, cul­ture, and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and sup­port struc­tures among oth­ers. In Vic­to­ria Falls, Covid-19 has barred hope to the whole com­mu­nity, which be­fore the pan­demic was en­tirely de­pen­dent on tourism. The im­ple­men­ta­tion of the lock­down, slow­down and phys­i­cal pub­lic dis­tance pop­u­larly known as “so­cial dis­tance” are mea­sures to mit­i­gate the trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. In line with the above these re­stric­tive mea­sures have had sig­nif­i­cant psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pacts to the lives of peo­ple. Covid-19 leaves im­me­di­ate and long-term traces of psy­cho­log­i­cal trauma in com­mu­ni­ties like Vic­to­ria Falls. The sud­den cut of sources of sur­vival to the indige­nous peo­ple in Vic­to­ria Falls will lead to the ram­i­fi­ca­tion of psy­cho­log­i­cal dis­or­ders which can vary from de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety, panic at­tacks, so­matic symp­toms, and post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der symp­toms, to delir­ium, psy­chosis and even sui­cide. To curb these prob­lems, psy­chol­o­gists should play a her­culean role in re­spond­ing to Covid-19 in ar­eas such as Vic­to­ria Falls. Covid-19 is the busi­ness for psy­chol­o­gists as it de­mands crit­i­cal psy­cho­log­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions and aware­ness. It is im­per­a­tive to have psy­chol­o­gists sig­nif­i­cantly par­tic­i­pate in the Task Force for Covid-19 as the pre and post front­line work­force so as to fight this long-drawn bat­tle and se­cure suc­cess for the fu­ture. Ac­cord­ing to re­search, psy­cho­log­i­cal de­fense is one of the key pil­lars used in Sin­ga­pore’s To­tal De­fense strat­egy to main­tain hope, trust and faith be­tween the pop­u­la­tion and the gov­ern­ment so as to en­sure re­silience dur­ing cri­sis. The psy­chol­o­gist should be on the front­line pro­mot­ing men­tal well­ness and ini­ti­at­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal in­ter­ven­tions for in­stance cog­ni­tive be­hav­iour ther­apy (CBT) and mind­ful­ness-based ther­apy (MBT). These ther­a­pies will re­spec­tively teach re­lax­ation tech­niques to com­bat anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion and to en­hance stress man­age­ment, mit­i­gate mal­adap­tive cop­ing skills of avoid­ance and self-blame. In Vic­to­ria Falls, there is wide­spread fear of be­ing tested and quar­an­tined (in­sti­tu­tion­alised). Ev­ery­thing starts in the mind; there­fore, psy­cho­log­i­cal em­pow­er­ment is the best ap­proach to fight the spread of the novel coro­n­avirus. The Covid-19 pan­demic is there­fore a wake-up call for im­prov­ing our weak health struc­tures and re­lated in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity as well as dis­as­ter pre­pared­ness. This pan­demic is a test for na­tional health sec­tor gov­er­nance. On a tra­di­tional ap­proach, there is need to re­spect our indige­nous knowl­edge sys­tems which ce­ment our cul­tural val­ues of ubuntu. There is need to re­wire our indige­nous health sys­tems. Re­ly­ing only on the al­lo­pathic ap­proach is not enough, our an­ces­tors used to have indige­nous prac­tices of fight­ing viruses such as in­fluenza. The holis­tic ap­proach to fight the epi­demic is the best strat­egy to win the war against Covid-19. Be­hav­ior is a re­flec­tion of men­tal pro­cesses.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160614,Bam­boo: Africa’s un­tapped po­ten­tial,"THE new eco­nomic force is gen­er­at­ing in­come, cre­at­ing jobs and pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. It is a “won­der plant” that is uniquely blessed. Agron­o­mists in Africa be­lieve it can re­store de­graded land­scapes while econ­o­mists think it is a po­ten­tial “green gold,” and a sil­ver bul­let for de­sign and ar­chi­tec­ture that is al­ready at­tract­ing a global mar­ket. Bam­boo—the highly ver­sa­tile gi­ant grass that can grow in al­most any kind of cli­mate and thrive in the poor­est of soils—has been in ex­is­tence for hun­dreds of years in Asia, Latin Amer­ica and parts of Africa. Yet for a long time the po­ten­tial of this fastest-grow­ing plant on earth, with recorded growth rates of up to one me­tre per day for some species, re­mained largely un­ex­ploited. It was not un­til re­cently that wide­spread com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of bam­boo be­gan tak­ing root, spurring hopes of gen­er­at­ing in­come and cre­at­ing jobs for the ru­ral poor. The world bam­boo mar­ket is grow­ing, led by China and an in­creas­ing de­mand for sus­tain­able prod­ucts in Europe and the United States. Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Net­work of Bam­boo and Rat­tan (IN­BAR), an in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion reg­is­tered with the United Na­tions that pro­motes the grow­ing of bam­boo and rat­tan for eco­nomic and en­vi­ron­men­tal gains, the global bam­boo econ­omy is now val­ued at $60 bil­lion, and is a po­ten­tial in­come gen­er­a­tor for ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties. To tap into this lu­cra­tive green econ­omy, African gov­ern­ments and the pri­vate sec­tor have be­gun po­si­tion­ing them­selves to com­mer­cialise bam­boo. The profit po­ten­tial has be­come even greater as en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists link bam­boo with cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion, and the pos­si­bil­ity of in­creased in­come through car­bon cred­its. So far 18 African coun­tries with nat­u­ral bam­boo—Benin, Bu­rundi, Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Kenya, Malawi, Mada­gas­car, Mozam­bique, Nige­ria, Rwanda, Sene­gal, Sierra Leone, Tan­za­nia, Togo, and Uganda—have joined IN­BAR, which is as­sist­ing them with bam­boo in­for­ma­tion, tech­nol­ogy trans­fer, ca­pac­ity build­ing and pol­icy for­mu­la­tion. Other coun­tries, like An­gola, Gabon and Zam­bia, are ex­pected to join the net­work. Ac­cord­ing to IN­BAR’s di­rec­tor gen­eral, Hans Friederich, bam­boo can be a strong pil­lar of Africa’s fu­ture green econ­omy. He says it can help re­duce poverty and pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment, and that it pro­vides a prac­ti­cal and rapid so­lu­tion for some of the nat­u­ral re­source and poverty chal­lenges fac­ing many African coun­tries to­day. “It is an amaz­ing plant that pro­vides a great op­por­tu­nity for mak­ing an in­come be­cause it grows in­cred­i­bly fast and a farmer can sell it as a raw prod­uct or can make prod­ucts out of it,” Friederich told Africa Re­newal. “It also does not re­quire any fer­tilis­ers or pes­ti­cides be­cause it has no real threat from dis­eases or pests. Once it is planted, you can leave it.” Bam­boo is used to make a long list of high-value prod­ucts. In fact, ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme (UNEP), the plant has over 2,000 dif­fer­ent uses, China reck­ons there are nearly 10,000 uses and can fetch even more money if pro­cessed. Com­mer­cially bam­boo is used for fur­ni­ture and a va­ri­ety of build­ing and roof­ing ma­te­ri­als, from fenc­ing poles to ve­neer, floor tiles, pan­els for walls and ceil­ings, scaf­fold­ing ma­te­rial, door and win­dow frames and win­dow blin­ders. In the pa­per and pulp in­dus­try, bam­boo can be made into newsprint, toi­let pa­per and card­board, which would help to con­serve Africa’s fi­nite re­sources, such as its forests. The tex­tile, food and chem­i­cal in­dus­tries con­vert bam­boo into fab­rics, T-shirts, wine, vinegar, bio-chem­i­cals and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. Do­mes­ti­cally bam­boo is used to make mats, bas­kets, ca­noes, fish­ing kits, bi­cy­cles, fences, tooth­picks, school desks, pen­cils and rulers, to name just a few prod­ucts. Bam­boo is also a source of bio-en­ergy. A ma­jor­ity of sub-Sa­ha­ran African house­holds use fire­wood or char­coal made from tim­ber for cook­ing, often lead­ing to de­for­esta­tion, land degra­da­tion and in­door pol­lu­tion. As the pop­u­la­tion in Africa in­creases, the massive har­vest­ing of fire­wood and char­coal will be un­sus­tain­able, ac­cord­ing to IN­BAR. Bam­boo pro­vides a clean and re­new­able en­ergy al­ter­na­tive in the form of char­coal bri­quettes and wood for do­mes­tic and in­dus­trial use. On pro­tect­ing the en­vi­ron­ment, some swear the bam­boo plant is “magic” in mit­i­gat­ing the ef­fects of cli­mate change through rapid re­for­esta­tion, slow­ing soil ero­sion and repairing dam­aged ecosys­tems. Bam­boo also serves as an ex­cel­lent largescale car­bon sink, each plant tak­ing in al­most dou­ble the car­bon diox­ide of a tree. Com­mer­cial bam­boo farm­ers may also ben­e­fit from ac­quir­ing car­bon cred­its. IN­BAR, the China Green Car­bon Foun­da­tion and Zhe­jiang Agri­cul­ture and Forestry Univer­sity have de­vel­oped a method­ol­ogy that will en­able pro­ject de­vel­op­ers to quan­tify the car­bon fluxes within a bam­boo plan­ta­tion, which can al­low the cal­cu­la­tion of car­bon cred­its earned. This would mean more in­come bam­boo farm­ers. Com­mer­cial bam­boo farm­ing has the po­ten­tial to cre­ate thousands of jobs, since it is labour in­ten­sive. Bam­boo plants are typ­i­cally planted, main­tained and har­vested by hand. In for Ghana, about 1,500 peo­ple were em­ployed when a com­mer­cial pro­ject started re­cently. In China, the bam­boo in­dus­try em­ploys nearly 8 mil­lion peo­ple, a num­ber that is ex­pected to hit 10 mil­lion by 2020, ac­cord­ing to IN­BAR. A bam­boo plant ma­tures in four to eight years, de­pend­ing on the species; how­ever, it can be har­vested as a peren­nial crop, with­out de­for­esta­tion, three to five years af­ter ini­tial plant­ing. It can be sus­tain­ably har­vested for well over 40 years. Once it starts grow­ing, bam­boo re­mains rooted in the soil, pro­duc­ing new shoots each year. This helps se­cure the soil and main­tain slope sta­bil­ity. “Un­like forests, where ev­ery­one says, ‘Don’t cut that tree,’ bam­boo grows back fast when you cut it. The more you cut, the more it grows,” says Friederich. Africa, he says, boasts huge re­serves of largely un­tapped indige­nous bam­boo, amount­ing to some 8 per­cent of the world’s bam­boo re­sources, and ex­cel­lent weather con­di­tions for grow­ing com­mer­cial species. Chal­lenges That bam­boo is ver­sa­tile and has lots of po­ten­tial is not in doubt. So why have African coun­tries over­looked the plant’s po­ten­tial for so long? “The big­gest chal­lenge is a lack of aware­ness,” Tes­faye Hunde, the head of the East Africa Re­gional Of­fice of IN­BAR in Ad­dis Ababa, told Africa Re­newal, adding that lack of fi­nances and the ab­sence of a na­tional pol­icy and strat­egy pro­gramme to de­velop and use bam­boo re­sources were also ham­per­ing progress. As aware­ness grows, more coun­tries are turn­ing to bam­boo. “The use of bam­boo is dra­mat­i­cally in­creas­ing,” says Hunde, adding: “Up to 36 coun­tries in Africa have nat­u­ral bam­boogrow­ing re­gions and IN­BAR is work­ing with other or­ga­ni­za­tions on bam­boo tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and train­ing farm­ers in the re­gion de­vel­op­ing a bam­boo value chain—from farm­ers to mar­kets— re­quires na­tional poli­cies, tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and in­vest­ment”. African gov­ern­ments also face the chal­lenges of equip­ping farm­ers with bam­boo plant­ing and main­te­nance skills, sup­ply­ing seedlings and team­ing up with the pri­vate sec­tor for pro­cess­ing and value ad­di­tion. More­over, de­spite promis­ing mar­ket po­ten­tial, those who wish to com­mer­cial­ize bam­boo prod­ucts still face hur­dles such as a lack of re­search, prod­uct in­no­va­tion and mar­ket­ing skills. Another chal­lenge is to ac­cu­rately des­ig­nate bam­boo to meet in­ter­na­tional trade and forestry stan­dards. “Bam­boo shows big po­ten­tial but suf­fers from an im­age prob­lem,” Gary Quince, the Euro­pean Union’s am­bas­sador to the African Union, was quoted as say­ing. “Many farm­ers see it as a pest be­cause it grows fast when in fact this is its real ben­e­fit.” The ques­tion is whether bam­boo species are in­va­sive, con­sid­er­ing their char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as rapid growth. There is fear about bam­boo’s abil­ity to dis­place na­tive veg­e­ta­tion, al­ter habi­tat and up­set food chains. A state­ment by the Amer­i­can Bam­boo So­ci­ety says the plant has a low po­ten­tial for in­va­sive­ness but recog­nises that some run­ning bam­boo species can be ag­gres­sive spread­ers if not well main­tained. IN­BAR is pro­vid­ing its mem­ber states with in­for­ma­tion on the is­sue, such as what species are best for dif­fer­ent soils and how to main­tain, in­ter­crop and har­vest bam­boo plants. Other or­gan­i­sa­tions such as WWF, GIZ and SNV, and UNEP, FAO, UNDP, NEPAD and ICRAF are also show­ing in­ter­ests in bam­boo, mostly through South-South co­op­er­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to Friederich. Al­ready China and The Nether­lands have agreed to fund a joint pro­ject in Africa. IN­BAR is cur­rently talk­ing to the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the Cana­dian gov­ern­ment, the In­ter­na­tional Fund for Agri­cul­tural Devel­op­ment (IFAD) and the City Foun­da­tion about pos­si­ble col­lab­o­ra­tion. To fully ben­e­fit from the bam­boo boom, the pri­vate sec­tor needs to be at the heart of green econ­omy devel­op­ment in or­der to drive de­mand and pro­vide in­vest­ment. Again, value ad­di­tion needs to be more in­no­va­tive if African bam­boo is to take the global mar­ket by storm. How­ever, there are those on the con­ti­nent call­ing for proper plan­ning be­fore go­ing full blast on bam­boo. Nige­rian en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist Nn­immo Bassey sees a unique prob­lem: “Bam­boo, which is nor­mally a free re­source through­out ru­ral Africa, could fall into pri­vate hands that would deny vil­lagers ac­cess and use of this re­source.” — Africa Re­newal",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161214,Guter­res is a good fit for an un­com­fort­able world,"IN SEVEN weeks the White House will be oc­cu­pied by an un­known quan­tity, a busi­ness­man with no po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence who has de­voted his life to the “art of the deal” - most re­cently a pact with the an­gry vot­ers of Amer­ica to se­cure the pres­i­dency. As Don­ald Trump puts to­gether his ad­min­is­tra­tion in a tal­ent show for­mat be­hind the golden doors of his pent­house, his tran­si­tion team has not im­pressed the watch­ing world. His core vot­ers see things dif­fer­ently - they love to see the es­tab­lish­ment hu­mil­i­ated. Diplo­mats are won­der­ing where af­ter Jan­uary 20 they will find the solid ground that the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem has rested on for so many years. Even those who chal­lenge Amer­i­can supremacy have got used to the pre- dictabil­ity and rel­a­tive trans­parency of Wash­ing­ton. Global lead­er­ship is not go­ing to come from Europe. Even if An­gela Merkel, the Ger­man chan­cel­lor, is re-elected next year, the con­ti­nent will be pre­oc­cu­pied with its mount­ing in­ter­nal crises. So where to turn to? Sur­pris­ingly, thoughts are turn­ing in an un­likely di­rec­tion, to the next United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral, An­to­nio Guter­res, who takes of­fice on Jan­uary 1. This is a rare oc­ca­sion when a UN chief takes of­fice at the same time as the US pres­i­dency is in tran­si­tion. UN chiefs are usu­ally se­lected for qual­i­ties that will not dis­turb the peace of the ma­jor pow­ers, which gen­er­ally means propos­ing too ac­tive a role for the UN in places where Wash­ing­ton wants a free hand. Mr Guter­res is cut from a dif­fer­ent cloth. Mr Guter­res won his position not through usual back­room deals, but through an open con­test where, as an ex­pe­ri­enced politi­cian, he was able to out­shine ri­vals from tech­no­cratic back­grounds. It had been the con­sen­sus that the job should go to a woman - for the first time - and that she should come from Eastern Europe. But there was no real com­pe­ti­tion to a man who has served as prime min­is­ter of Por­tu­gal (the first govern­ment leader to hold the top UN job) and then as a force­ful and pas­sion­ate UN High Com­mis­sioner for Refugees. In that job he started by cut­ting head­quar­ters costs by some 20 per­cent, ar­gu­ing that the money should be spent on the refugees. He man- aged to raise funds while crit­i­cis­ing the ma­jor donors - both the United Sates and the Euro­peans - over the fail­ings of refugee poli­cies. So at a time when Wash­ing­ton is adrift, a top-qual­ity ad­min­is­tra­tor who com­bines pas­sion with prag­ma­tism is about to take over at UN head­quar­ters. His tran­si­tion team, in con­trast to the Trump show, is purring along nicely, as Mr Guter­res trav­els to visit his new bosses in Moscow and Beijing. It seems a won­der­ful op­por­tu­nity. Just as the UN seemed fated to sink into ir­rel­e­vance for its im­po­tence to heal the bleed­ing wound of the Syria cri­sis, here comes a brave operator with a record of bridge build­ing dat­ing as far back to the Por­tuguese rev­o­lu­tion of 1974. He has set his sights on a res­o­lu­tion to the Syr­ian war, a task which has de­feated diplo­mats of the cal­i­bre of Kofi An­nan, Lakhdar Brahimi and cur­rently Staffan de Mis­tura. “It is the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s first pri­or­ity to be able to end this con­flict and then use the mo­men­tum cre­ated to try to ad­dress all the other con­flicts that are in­ter­linked.” No poverty of am­bi­tion there. At this point, it is time to reel in the en­thu­si­asm. Over­bur­den­ing Mr Guter­res with un­re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tions will do no good. The Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral is the ser­vant of the mem­ber states, or more pre­cisely, the ser­vant of the UN’s most pow­er­ful body, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, which is con­trolled by the five per­ma­nent mem­bers: China, France, Rus­sia, the US and the UK. As the Rus­sian Am­bas­sador to the UN, Vi­taly Churkin, has pointed out, the UN sys­tem is im­po­tent over Syria not be­cause of the weak­ness of the out­go­ing Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral but due to “dra­matic con­tra­dic­tions in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil which can­not be bridged”. It should also be pointed out that the UN sys­tem’s le­git­i­macy is con­stantly chal­lenged by its in­abil­ity to ad­just to the changed global bal­ance of power over the past 70 years. Even worse, Mr Trump’s “Amer­ica First” pol­icy could crip­ple the UN sys­tem - the United States pro­vides 22 per­cent of the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s reg­u­lar bud­get and large vol­un­tary con­tri­bu­tions to its agen­cies. Mr Trump has not shown re­spect by ap­point­ing as his UN am­bas­sador the South Carolina gover­nor, Nikki Ha­ley, a busi­ness­woman not known for her ex­pe­ri­ence in for­eign af­fairs. For the mo­ment there is a space at the top of the diplo­matic pyra­mid for an ex­pe­ri­enced me­di­a­tor, and Mr Guter­res looks like the man to fill it. If the con­tra­dic­tions be­tween Rus­sia and the US are at the mo­ment un­bridge­able, his­tory shows that they may not be for­ever. With Wash­ing­ton draw­ing back from global lead­er­ship, there are rare op­por­tu­ni­ties for change. In Beijing, Mr Guter­res has been talk­ing about cli­mate change, which dur­ing the sec­ond Obama term was a joint US-China en­ter­prise. If Mr Trump is no longer in­ter­ested in be­ing the leader in car­bon re­duc­tion, China could step up. Success would trans­form China’s im­age as a world power com­mit­ted to mak­ing the in­ter­na­tional sys­tem work. There would be some risks - such as greater scru­tiny of ev­ery­thing China does. It was noted that Mr Guter­res did not pass through Beijing with­out a po­lite but surely un­wel­come re­minder that eco­nomic growth needed to be bal­anced with “hu­man rights and civil and po­lit­i­cal rights”. The chance that the UN un­der Mr Guter­res may rise to its pri­mary task of promoting peace is a rare chink of light in a dark­en­ing world. But it is also a pos­si­bil­ity that the world sys­tem may get more bro­ken, and will take the United Na­tions down with it. For once the UN has a leader who is up to the task be­fore him if any­one is. - then­ational.ae",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151127,Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones bill gazetted,"THE gov­ern­ment has gazetted the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones (SEZs) Bill and now awaits ap­proval of its full im­ple­men­ta­tion frame­work by Par­lia­ment, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa said yes­ter­day. SEZs are ge­o­graph­i­cal ar­eas gov­erned by one over­sight man­age­ment body that of­fers spe­cial trade in­cen­tives to firms that es­tab­lish them­selves in the des­ig­nated zones. Adop­tion of the con­cept is ex­pected to as­sist in the turn­around of the coun­try’s econ­omy and help pro­mote value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. Pre­sent­ing the 2015 na­tional bud­get yes­ter­day in Par­lia­ment, Chi­na­masa said SEZs were part of a broader na­tional eco­nomic frame­work aimed at re­ju­ve­nat­ing in­dus­try growth. “A Spe­cial Eco­nomic Bill has been ap­proved and was gazetted on Mon­day to pave way for its im­ple­men­ta­tion. The gov­ern­ment is craft­ing the nec­es­sary frame­work for cre­ation of SEZs to be ap­proved by this Au­gust house,” he said. Chi­na­masa hoped that SEZs would help pro­mote value ad­di­tion and prod­uct ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion in line with re­gional in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion ini­tia­tives un­der the Sadc and the African con­ti­nent at large. Al­ready, the gov­ern­ment has tar­geted in­dus­try and zones for SEZs, of which leather and tex­tiles would be in Bu­l­awayo. Lupane would host petro-chem­i­cals given its vast nat­u­ral gas de­posits while a tourism cor­ri­dor would stretch from Vic­to­ria Falls, Gwayi and Binga up to Kariba. The tech­nol­ogy hub, Sun­way City and di­a­mond cut­ting would be in Harare and Mutare. The gov­ern­ment also en­vis­ages that the suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of SEZs will at­tract in­creased for­eign direct in­vest­ment and help in­crease ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion. In the past, the pri­vate sec­tor has called on the gov­ern­ment to speed-up the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the SEZ con­cept. Of late, in­vest­ment in­flows have re­mained sub­dued due to per­ceived coun­try risk, poor rank­ings on the ease of do­ing busi­ness and struc­tural is­sues in the econ­omy, re­sult­ing in Zim­babwe lag­ging re­gional peers in at­tract­ing for­eign direct in­vest­ment. In 2014, Zim­babwe at­tracted $545 mil­lion while Zam­bia, South Africa and An­gola at­tracted $2,4 bil­lion, $5,7 bil­lion and $3,8 bil­lion re­spec­tively. The gov­ern­ment is on record say­ing firms that choose to lo­cate them­selves within zones would be of­fered spe­cial trade in­cen­tives. The set­ting up of SEZ is one of the key poli­cies en­shrined in Zim-As­set. Through eco­nomic zones, Zim­babwe is also ex­pected to im­prove the econ­omy’s ca­pac­ity to pro­duce and ex­port goods and ser­vices, at­tract­ing in­vest­ment in­flows from both do­mes­tic and for­eign sources. In ad­di­tion, this will see the coun­try cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment and re­duc­ing poverty. Suc­cess­ful SEZs have been es­tab­lished in coun­tries such as China, Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­dia, Poland and South Korea.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150123,How much longer shall we wait for change?,"PRES­I­DENT Robert Mu­gabe ar­rived home yes­ter­day from the Far East at the end of a lengthy hol­i­day which has re­port­edly in­cluded med­i­cal treat­ment in Sin­ga­pore. This would not be re­mark­able were the pres­i­dent a rea­son­ably ro­bust and en­er­getic ruler, but that is man­i­festly not the case. At 90, Mu­gabe is strug­gling to main­tain a level of health which would be a chal­lenge for a younger man let alone one car­ry­ing out a busy sched­ule in his 90s. Next month will see him cel­e­brate his 91st birth­day. Is he up to all this with the de­mands on what would nor­mally be ex­pected of a much younger man? The prob­lem here is not that Mu­gabe is ail­ing, although that is not de­nied. It is that he con­tin­ues to dom­i­nate the po­lit­i­cal scene with his foot so thor­oughly wedged in the po­lit­i­cal door that there is no room for other par­tic­i­pants. In ad­di­tion to a busy po­lit­i­cal sched­ule, Mu­gabe has presided over an im­pres­sive dairy farm­ing op­er­a­tion which takes scant no­tice of Zanu PF’s re­stric­tions on mul­ti­ple farm own­er­ship. Put to­gether there is a prob­lem. The coun­try needs firm and en­light­ened lead­er­ship. As it stands, the lead­er­ship com­prises greedy and un­en­light­ened lead­ers who squat across the na­tion on the farms they have taken pos­ses­sion of with dam­ag­ing con­se­quences for the agri­cul­tural econ­omy. Zim­babwe is to­day a coun­try mired in poverty and ig­no­rance be­cause lead­ers make ar­bi­trary de­ci­sions that are not of ben­e­fit to the coun­try and en­cour­age their fol­low­ers to be equally delin­quent so mis­gov­er­nance is com­pounded. A good ex­am­ple was the re­cent dis­tri­bu­tion of lux­ury ve­hi­cles to cab­i­net min­is­ters, MPs and other lu­mi­nar­ies. Con­spic­u­ous among the ben­e­fi­cia­ries were in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers who can­not be said not to know the ex­tent of the prob­lems the coun­try faces. A sim­ple com­par­i­son with Botswana, Namibia and Mozam­bique would il­lus­trate the quandary of neigh­bour­ing states that are bet­ter gov­erned de­spite less ex­pe­ri­ence and which can at­tract FDI with­out too much fuss. Nor are they sub­or­di­nate to China’s world­wide am­bi­tions. For many Zim­bab­weans, the lit­mus test will prob­a­bly be the as­cent to power of First Lady Grace Mu­gabe. Bran­dish­ing her du­bi­ous PhD, her ap­point­ment raises ques­tions of power man­age­ment in a de­clin­ing econ­omy. If the in­ten­tion was to en­able the pres­i­dent to con­tinue in of­fice for a longer pe­riod then it will fail at the pop­u­lar­ity hur­dle. It is dif­fi­cult to imag­ine any­thing more chal­leng­ing than Grace’s can­di­dacy for a min­is­te­rial post. But it is the com­bi­na­tion of cir­cum­stances that will in the end deal a pos­si­ble knock­out blow to the am­bi­tious elite which does not hide its en­thu­si­asm to sub­mit us to its yoke.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20200329,"Coro­n­avirus:
A new plan­e­tar­ity","THE coro­n­avirus pan­demic is bring­ing to the front seat what can be called a hu­man and a plan­e­tary ques­tion. As hu­man be­ings what, and who are we, in this vast planet. What power do we com­mand over na­ture and its vis­i­ble and in­vis­i­ble el­e­ments? That a virus can cause such world­wide catas­tro­phe and take so many lives, in the process caus­ing such a tragedy and a scare is a sign that the macro-uni­verse of men and women is not safe from the mi­cro-uni­verse of bac­te­ria, virus and other small but pow­er­ful mon­sters of na­ture. It is a com­mon and also prover­bial tru­ism in the jun­gle that the ele­phant, ruler of the African jun­gle, is vul­ner­a­ble to one of the small­est fig­ures of the wilder­ness, the ant. Like any other virus, the coro­n­avirus is so small as to be in­vis­i­ble but as pow­er­ful as can­not be ig­nored for the dam­age that it can do to the masters of the uni­verse, the most in­tel­li­gent an­i­mals, men and women. The small but very pow­er­ful force of the virus is, in my view, rais­ing cap­i­tal hu­man and plan­e­tary ques­tions that can only be ig­nored at our own peril. The coro­n­avirus is real; it is hu­man and has huge plan­e­tary im­pli­ca­tions. It is un­der the at­tack of such hu­man and plan­e­tary mon­strosi­ties as the coro­n­avirus that the true con­di­tion of the world and that of hu­man­ity usu­ally comes out. So­ci­eties and their hu­man be­ings can best be judged when they are un­der cri­sis and catas­tro­phe. The truth it­self might as well be the child of catas­tro­phe and cri­sis. One of the telling truths about us hu­man be­ings in the planet is that, in spite of all the in­tel­li­gence and power that we flaunt; we are a par­tic­u­larly frag­ile and vul­ner­a­ble lot. Our power and mas­tery of the uni­verse is real, ob­vi­ous, but truly fake. In that vein all forms of power and con­trol might af­ter all be fun­da­men­tally fake, and vul­ner­a­ble to the small, seem­ingly pow­er­less and in­vis­i­ble mon­strosi­ties. The coro­n­avirus is ev­i­dently deadly and openly demo­cratic in its vi­ral­ity. It is dis­re­spect­ful of hu­man class and race. Af­ter dis­miss­ing the need for quar­an­tin­ing hu­man be­ings to com­bat the pan­demic, Ira­nian Deputy Min­is­ter of Health, Iraj Harirchi humbly ad­mit­ted that he had con­tracted the virus him­self, is bat­tling the deadly ail­ment. His sober ob­ser­va­tion was that: “This virus is demo­cratic, and it doesn’t dis­tin­guish be­tween poor and rich or be­tween states­man and or­di­nary cit­i­zen.” Noth­ing, even power, priv­i­lege, promi­nence and money, can pro­tect a hu­man be­ing from this lat­est pan­demic. Ini­tially, the Pres­i­dent of the United States of Amer­ica, Don­ald Trump, was proud to dis­miss it as the “Chi­nese Virus.” He can­not say so now as the virus has proven that it is as Amer­i­can as it is a cit­i­zen of any part of the planet. That it was first de­tected in China may be credit to Chi­nese sci­ence and po­lit­i­cal alert­ness than it is proof that it orig­i­nated in China. The coro­n­avirus is med­i­cal and po­lit­i­cal. It comes and spreads in a world con­text. The eco­nomic and there­fore po­lit­i­cal war be­tween China and the USA is a real world con­text upon which the coro­n­avirus has de­posited it­self. The USA will blame China and China blame the USA. We live in a con­tested world. One won­ders if World War III is not go­ing to be a bi­o­log­i­cal and med­i­cal war. Or that the trou­bled planet upon which men and women have com­mit­ted mass mur­der, pol­lu­tion and other sins is go­ing to fight back with hur­ri­canes, tor­na­does, earth­quakes, heat­waves, cold fronts and dis­eases. In the coro­n­avirus we are to­gether; Boaven­tura San­tos re­minds us that ac­tu­ally “pan­demic” refers to “all hu­man be­ings.” Here is a plan­e­tary cri­sis that forces us to look at each other in the eye as dif­fer­ent but also the same hu­man be­ings un­der the sun. Not the Only Virus Our world, po­lit­i­cally and eco­nom­i­cally, works with fash­ion and trend. To be true, the coro­n­avirus is not the only virus. It is just the lat­est or the one that is trend­ing, has be­come vi­ral. Sci­en­tists can in­voke epi­demi­ol­ogy and ex­plain to us what is hap­pen­ing but a philoso­pher can note that there are peo­ple in the world that have, from their birth, lived pan­demic lives of mis­ery, suf­fer­ing and pre­car­ity of ex­is­tence. Poverty, ig­no­rance, and not just dis­ease, have been pan­demics that have defined the ex­is­tence of the ma­jor­ity of the peo­ple of the planet. Im­pe­ri­al­ism, slav­ery, colo­nial­ism and tyranny have been pan­demic viruses at large in the planet. What coro­n­avirus has achieved, in its mon­stros­ity is to re­mind us that in spite of the class and race dif­fer­ences that we have con­structed and used against each other in the planet, we are the same. Slavoj Zizek is right there­fore in ob­serv­ing that the coro­n­avirus comes among viruses of ide­o­log­i­cal mys­ti­fi­ca­tion, fake news and other hu­man dis­as­ters that have been go­ing on for some time now. Zizek takes it fur­ther to sur­mise that coro­n­avirus will teach cap­i­tal­ism a com­mu­nist les­son; that we be­long to­gether and any­thing else is fake, let us fairly share the world and what­ever good it can of­fer. I can add that we must stop be­ing viruses to each other po­lit­i­cally and eco­nom­i­cally be­cause there are enough viruses in na­ture to fin­ish all of us off. We as hu­man be­ings are and have been dy­ing of many other things be­fore we knew of the coro­n­avirus. But this one brings a spe­cial death that seems not to choose along the usual lines. As in the true last days, coro­n­avirus has al­most drama­tised the les­son that some­times the first may be last, and the last first. Zizek seeks to make a deeper philo­soph­i­cal ob­ser­va­tion of this. Not only is this a huge plan­e­tary catas­tro­phe but it is also an in­di­vid­ual calamity. Corona rules are de­mand­ing at plan­e­tary and in­di­vid­ual level. Strict to the rules, ac­tu­ally, one must not only iso­late him­self and her­self from oth­ers, but cer­tain parts of one’s body must not have con­tact. Coron­a­wise, our hands must not touch our mouths, eyes and other ori­fices. At the same time; the med­i­cal idea of quar­an­tin­ing peo­ple does not only col­lapse the bor­ders be­tween hos­pi­tals and pris­ons but also brings back the prob­lem of cre­at­ing bor­ders and build­ing fences to sep­a­rate hu­man be­ings from each other. In that way, the coro­n­avirus brings out telling truths about our mod­ern colo­nial world sys­tem that feeds on clas­si­fi­ca­tions and sep­a­ra­tions. Iso­la­tion is true dis­crim­i­na­tion. Zizek mourns that it has taken such a catas­tro­phe to teach us the very ba­sic truth that orig­i­nally and nat­u­rally, as hu­man be­ings in na­ture we are one. The air, wa­ter, soil, plants and wild an­i­mal life are liv­ing en­ti­ties that must be in com­mu­nion with us. What we give to na­ture, the Rasta­far­i­ans be­lieve, na­ture will give it back to us in huge quan­ti­ties. So we may ask; what have we given to na­ture as hu­man be­ings to al­low us to ques­tion what na­ture is giv­ing us? Na­ture: The Real At­ten­tion Seeker I am sure I am not the only one. As the coro­n­avirus flexes its mus­cles and shows that it can wipe help­less hu­man be­ings from the floor of the planet we all look up to sci­ence to save us. We wake up in the morn­ing to pe­ruse jour­nals, news­pa­pers and other sites to see if any scientist in the world has landed a cure or at least a vac­cine. In times of epi­demics and pan­demics, Sci­ence and God are looked and called upon to in­ter­vene. Ev­ery one of us be­comes re­li­gious and sci­en­tific in the face of a pan­demic. And both re­li­gion and sci­ence sim­ply un­der­stood and philo­soph­i­cally taken; re­fer to na­ture, the vis­i­ble, tan­gi­ble and the in­vis­i­ble uni­verse. The term En­light­en­ment that was pop­u­larised by western phi­los­o­phy and sci­ence refers to how man came to con­quer na­ture and master the uni­verse. How man brought light to the dark­ness of the world, that is. And man has done it. Gi­ant in­fra­struc­tures are here. Pow­er­ful atomic bombs that can end the earth in the press of a but­ton are here. Fast dig­i­tal and 3D, even 5D, tech­no­log­i­cal de­vices are ours. That is all true but what is not true is that we have mas­tered na­ture or con­quered the uni­verse. We are frag­ile and vul­ner­a­ble to na­ture; with all our sci­ence and might. Man has sought and found at­ten­tion as the pow­er­ful con­queror of the uni­verse and master of the earth but the real at­ten­tion seeker and finder is na­ture and its vis­i­ble and in­vis­i­ble mon­sters. We can talk of nat­u­ral re­sources that we can ex­ploit for power and profit but let us agree that it is a mon­u­men­tal fal­lacy that we have con­quered na­ture. Never must we Waste a Good Cri­sis One of my favourable philo­soph­i­cal apho­risms came from Chair­man Mao: “There is great dis­or­der un­der the heav­ens; the sit­u­a­tion is ex­cel­lent.” Ev­ery great dis­or­der and catas­tro­phe cre­ates ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­ni­ties for thought and in­ven­tion. Sus­pend­ing the be­liefs that coro­n­avirus is man-made and some­one wants to reap po­lit­i­cal and fi­nan­cial prof­its from it (in phi­los­o­phy ev­ery con­spir­acy the­ory is an­other truth), what ap­pears is that coro­n­avirus is prov­ing to man, black and white, big and small, that we are noth­ing. The virus is cre­at­ing great dis­or­der un­der the heav­ens and philo­soph­i­cally, the sit­u­a­tion is ex­cel­lent. True to Han­nah Arendt, in such Dark Times as this, we must do noth­ing but think! We live in a failed world sys­tem that has cre­ated and pro­duced failed con­di­tions and states that can­not pro­tect us from na­ture and its vi­o­lences. Coro­n­avirus pro­vides a world and hu­man cri­sis that we can­not waste. It is dis­or­der that pro­vides an ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­nity for imag­in­ing and build­ing an­other world and an­other hu­man­ity. We need a new Hu­man­ity and a new Plan­e­tar­ity. For­get the races, the tribes, the gen­ders and the bor­ders, we are one species among other species that are in trou­ble with our­selves and ul­ti­mately with na­ture.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150424,PM steps into oil dis­putes with Gabon,"Cameron writes to Pres­i­dent Bongo af­ter as­sets are ex­pro­pri­ated David Cameron has in­ter­vened in an es­ca­lat­ing row be­tween UK oil com­pa­nies and the gov­ern­ment of Gabon af­ter the petroleum min­istry ex­pro­pri­ated as­sets from the ex­plorer Tul­low Oil and threat­ened Royal Dutch Shell with a fine for non-pay­ment of back taxes. The prime min­is­ter has writ­ten to the pres­i­dent of the African coun­try, Ali Bongo Ondimba, af­ter in­ter­ven­tions from the For­eign and Com­mon­wealth Of­fice over the past year failed to re­solve the dis­pute. In a let­ter promis­ing aid for the Gabonese pres­i­dent's battle against the poach­ers dec­i­mat­ing the coun­try's un­ri­valled pop­u­la­tion of for­est ele­phants - a cam­paign sup­ported by Prince Wil­liam - Mr. Cameron stresses the im­por­tance of Bri­tain's re­la­tion­ship with the re­source-rich coun­try. The prime min­is­ter says he hopes the “com­pa­nies con­cerned and the Gabonese gov­ern­ment can come to an agree­ment” soon. The UK gov­ern­ment has en­cour­aged in­vest­ment in Gabon since Pres­i­dent Bongo was elected to suc­ceed his fa­ther, Omar Bongo, in 2009. Though his elec­tion was dis­puted and sparked protests, Mr. Bongo ini­tially won in­ter­na­tional praise for promis­ing to erad­i­cate the cor­rup­tion that had be­come a way of life un­der his fa­ther; Omar Bongo was one of Africa's rich­est men and his hold on power lasted 42 years. Gabon, with just 1.7m peo­ple, was ranked the UK's 94th largest im­port part­ner in 2013, up from 143rd in 2012. For­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in 2013 was $856m. But re­cent ac­tions by the oil min­istry have raised con­cerns in Lon­don over the cli­mate for busi­ness in Gabon, in par­tic­u­lar as the coun­try seeks in­vest­ment to de­velop off­shore re­serves. Early last year the oil min­is­ter, Eti­enne Ngoubou, locked Tul­low Oil out of ne­go­ti­a­tions on the re­newal of a li­cence on the on­shore Onal field, in ef­fect ex­pro­pri­at­ing the UK com­pany's 7.5 per cent stake. In an at­tempt to get its stake back, the oil com­pany has twice of­fered bet­ter terms, even reach­ing an agree­ment in prin­ci­ple with the oil min­is­ter. How­ever, min­is­ters are yet to give their fi­nal ap­proval. “We have been as­sured by the gov­ern­ment that our con­tract will be hon­oured,” Tul­low told the Fi­nan­cial Times. “How­ever, we are very con­cerned by the de­lay. Sanc­tity of con­tract is al­ways vi­tal but it is even more im­por­tant at this crit­i­cal and dif­fi­cult time for the oil and gas sec­tor to en­sure fu­ture in­vest­ment.” Ai­dan Heavey, Tul­low's chief ex­ec­u­tive, has in the past made dona­tions to the Con­ser­va­tive party. But the com­pany said it had not asked Mr. Cameron to write to Mr. Bongo. Mr. Ngoubou re­vealed this month that he was con­sid­er­ing levy­ing penal­ties of tens of mil­lions of dol­lars against Royal Dutch Shell for back taxes. Shell de­clined to com­ment. Gabon's oil min­istry failed to re­spond to re­quests for a com­ment.

But with all that, the Chi­nese are not about to dump Kim Jong-un. Political dis­tanc­ing, yes, but no se­ri­ous (i.e., desta­bil­is­ing) eco­nomic sanc­tions such as the US is now de­mand­ing. While in Bei­jing in late Jan­uary, Kerry threat­ened that the US, with South Korea’s pos­si­ble ap­proval (a re­ver­sal of po­si­tion), would go ahead with in­stalling a theatre mis­sile de­fence sys­tem (THAAD) that the Chi­nese have long re­garded as ac­tu­ally aimed at neu­tral­is­ing their own mis­siles rather than only North Korea’s. Rest as­sured that all such a threat will ac­com­plish is to har­den Chi­nese views of US strat­egy in Asia, lately strained fur­ther by height­ened US pa­trolling in the South China Sea, and lessen their com­mit­ment to im­pos­ing sanc­tions on the North. The DPRK’s pos­ses­sion of an in­creas­ingly so­phis­ti­cated nu­clear pro­gram that aims at minia­tur­is­ing bombs is no small mat­ter. As Sigfried Hecker, for­mer di­rec­tor of the Los Alamos Na­tional Lab­o­ra­tory, points out , the North Kore­ans “may have enough bomb fuel for 18 bombs, with a ca­pac­ity to make six to seven more an­nu­ally. That, com­bined with the in­creased so­phis­ti­ca­tion they surely achieved with this test, paints a trou­ble­some pic­ture.” Sanc­tions, threats, and “half-hearted diplo­macy,” Hecker ob­serves, have failed to change the nu­clear pic­ture. Se­ri­ous en­gage­ment with North Korea re­mains the only re­al­is­tic pol­icy op­tion for the United States and its al­lies. To be ef­fec­tive, how­ever (i.e., mean­ing­ful to the other side), en­gage­ment must be un­der­taken strate­gi­cally — as a cal­cu­lated use of in­cen­tives with ex­pec­ta­tion of mu­tual re­wards, namely in se­cu­rity and peace. And it should be un­der­taken in a spirit of mu­tual re­spect and with due re­gard for sen­si­tiv­ity in lan­guage and ac­tion. Here are three el­e­ments of an en­gage­ment pack­age: First is re­vival of the Six-Party Talks with­out pre­con­di­tions and with faith­ful­ness to pre­vi­ous six-party and North-South Korea joint dec­la­ra­tions — in par­tic­u­lar, the prin­ci­ple con­tained in the Six-Party Joint State­ment of Septem­ber 2005: “com­mit­ment for com­mit­ment, ac­tion for ac­tion.” At a new round of talks, the US and its part­ners should present a pack­age that, in re­turn for ver­i­fi­able steps to neu­tralise North Korea’s nu­clear, pro­vides the North with se­cu­rity as­sur­ances, a pro­posal for end­ing the Korean War, a nonag­gres­sion pact with big-power guar­an­tees (with China on board), and mean­ing­ful eco­nomic as­sis­tance from both NGOs and gov­ern­ments. Such a ma­jor de­par­ture from “strate­gic pa­tience” would be in line with Kim Jongil’s mes­sage to Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush in Novem­ber 2002: “If the United States recog­nises our sovereignty and as­sures nonag­gres­sion, it’s our view that we should be able to find a way to re­solve the nu­clear is­sue in com­pli­ance with the de­mands of a new cen­tury. . . .If the United States makes a bold de­ci­sion, we will re­spond ac­cord­ingly.” Se­cond is cre­ation of a North­east Asia Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue Mech­a­nism. We might re­call that such a group was an­tic­i­pated in the fi­nal state­ments of the Six-Party Talks, and that South Korea’s Pres­i­dent Park has pro­posed a sim­i­lar peace ini­tia­tive. In the ab­sence of hon­est bro­kers for dis­putes in North­east Asia, the NEASDM can func­tion as a “cir­cuit breaker,” able to in­ter­rupt pat­terns of es­ca­lat­ing con­fronta­tion when ten­sions in the re­gion in­crease — as they are now. But the NEASDM would not fo­cus ex­clu­sively on North Korean de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion. It would be open to a wide range of is­sues re­lated to se­cu­rity in the broad­est sense, such as en­vi­ron­men­tal, labour, poverty, and pub­lic health prob­lems; a code of con­duct to gov­ern ter­ri­to­rial and bound­ary dis­putes; mil­i­tary bud­get trans­parency, weapons trans­fers, and de­ploy­ments; mea­sures to com­bat ter­ror­ism and piracy; cre­ation of a nu­clear-weapon free zone (NWFZ) in all or part of North­east Asia; and ways to sup­port con­fi­dence build­ing and trust in the di­a­logue process it­self. Nor­mal­i­sa­tion of re­la­tions among all six coun­tries should be a pri­or­ity; full recog­ni­tion of the DPRK by the United States and Ja­pan costs noth­ing but is an im­por­tant in­cen­tive for mean­ing­ful North Korean par­tic­i­pa­tion. Third is sig­nif­i­cant new hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to North Korea. The US and South Korean em­pha­sis on sanc­tions pun­ishes the wrong peo­ple. Kim Jong-un’s com­plete dis­re­gard for hu­man rights, vig­or­ously con­demned in a UN com­mis­sion of in­quiry re­port in 2014, is be­fore the Gen­eral As­sem­bly and will be de­bated in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil de­spite China’s dis­ap­proval. (The vote to de­bate was 9-4 with two ab­sten­tions.) But nei­ther hu­man rights de­pri­va­tions nor nu­clear test­ing should af­fect hu­man­i­tar­ian aid to North Korea — food, medicine, med­i­cal equip­ment, tech­ni­cal train­ing — which at least helps some por­tion of its pop­u­la­tion and sends the mes­sage that the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity cares about the North Korean peo­ple. Hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance to the DPRK is piti­fully lit­tle — un­der $50 mil­lion in 2014, and de­clin­ing ev­ery year. The same kind of steady, pa­tient, and cre­ative diplo­macy that led to the nu­clear deal with Iran is still pos­si­ble in the North Korea case. As the Un­der Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral of the UN, Jef­frey Felt­man, said, Iran shows that “diplo­macy can work to ad­dress non­pro­lif­er­a­tion chal­lenges. There is strong in­ter­na­tional con­sen­sus on the need to work for peace, sta­bil­ity and de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion on the Korean Penin­sula.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150206,Africa’s devel­op­ment re­mains an illusion,"SUB-SA­HA­RAN African coun­tries have not ful­filled their po­ten­tial since in­de­pen­dence. While other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and re­gions have grown over the past 50 years, much of Africa has stag­nated. African lead­ers have be­come adept at ex­ter­nal­is­ing blame, hold­ing oth­ers re­spon­si­ble for Africa's fail­ings. Ac­cord­ing to Greg Mills, in his book, Why Africa is Poor, African lead­ers note a lack of cap­i­tal, ac­cess to world mar­kets, or tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise are to blame for the con­ti­nent's un­der­de­vel­op­ment. Can this be true? Maybe yes. Maybe not. But what is clear is Sub Sa­ha­ran Africa (SSA) is trapped in a devel­op­ment para­dox which has a his­tor­i­cal foot­print. Ex­pla­na­tions for the un­der­de­vel­op­ment in SSA are many and com­plex. Some con­tribut­ing fac­tors are in­ter­nal, some are ex­ter­nal in ori­gin. One area of con­cern that has re­ceived in­creased at­ten­tion in re­cent years is Africa's enor­mous ex­ter­nal debt and pro­grammes spon­sored by the World Bank and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) to deal with Africa's de­vel­op­men­tal chal­lenges. Many schol­ars have been grap­pling to pro­vide a com­pre­hen­sive an­swer to a com­plex is­sue of devel­op­ment in SSA. I will at­tempt to do so by iden­ti­fy­ing an FDI re­liance-re­jec­tion para­dox em­a­nat­ing from the in­com­pat­i­bil­ity be­tween colo­nial lega­cies and Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­grammes as ex­ter­nal fac­tors and also look at the Africa's eco­nomic and nat­u­ral re­source gov­er­nance as also con­tribut­ing fac­tors. It is im­por­tant to note that some parts of Africa have been at one point richer and more de­vel­oped than other parts of the world that have sur­passed Africa by a very wide devel­op­ment mar­gin in the present day. In 1962, when the World Bank ex­tended its first devel­op­ment loan to South Korea, the bank's di­rec­tors fa­mously asked their re­searcher whether there was any chance of this im­pov­er­ished and war-torn coun­try ever catch­ing up with the living stan­dards of such wealthy African coun­tries as the newly lib­er­ated re­publics of Ghana, Nige­ria and Sene­gal, with their huge en­dow­ments of gold, oil, di­a­monds and for­est prod­ucts. To­day, South Korea's na­tional in­come per head is 35 times higher than Ghana's and three times that of Africa's rich­est coun­try, Botswana. Mean­while, China, which as re­cently as 25 years ago was less pros­per­ous than even the poor­est African na­tions, now has an econ­omy five times larger than the en­tire African con­ti­nent. Scram­ble for Africa Africa's un­der­de­vel­op­ment stems from the fact that the scram­ble for Africa was partly driven by the search for raw ma­te­ri­als for the grow­ing industrial base in Europe, hence coloni­sa­tion re­mains a tool through which a devel­op­ment par­a­digm for Africa was de­vel­oped. Since the pub­li­ca­tion of the first poverty re­port by the World Bank in 1948, poverty has been de­fined as living on less than US$2 a day and ex­treme poverty as living on less than US$1 a day. This flawed def­i­ni­tion pushed devel­op­ment agents and spe­cial­ists to think that Africa needs eco­nomic growth in or­der to catch up with the so­ci­eties in the West. Guided by modernist ideas, the in­ten­tion was to let the con­ti­nent move from tra­di­tion to moder­nity. Such an evo­lu­tion­ary think­ing was prop­a­gated by global fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions like the World Bank and IMF whose re­form packages and loan con­di­tional ties have ended up in the Africa's present day debt over­hang. The devel­op­ment model adopted for Africa is there­fore a du­pli­cate of what the West­ern world used, which is the eco­nomic growth model rest­ing on the idea that the higher the GDP, the more eco­nom­i­cally well that coun­try is. A his­tor­i­cal per­spec­tive is there­fore es­sen­tial in or­der to un­der­stand why African economies have failed to take part in the in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic devel­op­ment we have seen par­tic­u­larly in the era of glob­al­i­sa­tion. State build­ing The main achieve­ment of colo­nial­ism rule was state build­ing which in­volved im­pos­ing the Euro­pean sys­tem of com­pet­ing na­tion states on the con­ti­nent through a process of con­quest that was largely mo­ti­vated by Euro­pean strate­gic in­ter­ests. The re­sult was a po­lit­i­cal map that is eco­nom­i­cally ir­ra­tional and dys­func­tional. He sums up this state of af­fairs in the ti­tle of one of his books, The Black­man’s Bur­den in Africa and the curse of the na­tion state. This, in real essence, paral­ysed the African trad­ing sys­tems that had ex­isted since the 16th cen­tury. In that re­gard, colo­nial­ism and neo-colo­nial­ism, slav­ery and the im­posed mod­erni­sa­tion pro­grammes and projects that are con­stantly and bru­tally forced on to SSA by the glob­al­i­sa­tion process con­tinue to keep the re­gion on its knees. Slav­ery took away the able bod­ied men and women of the con­ti­nent who would have worked to build it at their pace, as­pi­ra­tions and ca­pa­bil­i­ties. The colo­nial le­gacy has also left a de­pen­dence syn­drome and con­tin­u­ous re­liance on colo­nial masters lead­ing to loss of iden­tity, lack of par­tic­i­pa­tion in de­ci­sion mak­ing and ac­count­abil­ity of gov­ern­ments to their pop­u­la­tions for shap­ing de­vel­op­men­tal poli­cies. This is sup­ported by Rod­ney (1972) who ar­gued that a combi- na­tion of power pol­i­tics and eco­nomic ex­ploita­tion of Africa by Euro­peans led to the poor state of African po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic devel­op­ment ev­i­dent in the late 20th cen­tury. There has been a poor per­cep­tion by West­ern Coun­tries of Africa and Africans in gen­eral. This kind of per­cep­tion has made Africa a mill­house of eco­nomic ex­per­i­ments by the Bre­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions and the so called devel­op­ment part­ners from the donor world. Since the 1980s, In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions (IFIs), the World Bank and IMF, have come up with var­i­ous devel­op­ment and aid packages and have im­posed for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment as the main source to fi­nance the devel­op­ment of SSA, while ig­nor­ing other im­por­tant struc­tural fac­tors em­a­nat­ing from colo­nial lega­cies and the over de­pen­dence on nat­u­ral re­source ex­trac­tion. One of the many ex­am­ples is the late 1980s re­forms through the struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grammes by the IMF and the World Bank that were im­posed on the SSA as devel­op­ment in­ter­ven­tion. With­out a sound un­der­stand­ing of the cul­tural con­text of coun­tries and com­mu­ni­ties for which in­ter­ven­tion mea­sures have been de­signed, the struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grammes that were all wrapped in one- size-fits-all devel­op­ment model, re­sulted in weak SSA de­vel­op­men­tal states and wined off African gov­ern­ments from per­form­ing their ba­sic func­tions. Fol­low­ing an ide­ol­ogy known as neo-lib­er­al­ism, and spear­headed by th­ese and other in­sti­tu­tions known as the Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus, Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Poli­cies (SAPs) were im­posed to en­sure debt re­pay­ment and eco­nomic re­struc­tur­ing. It re­quired poor coun­tries to re­duce spend­ing on things like health, ed­u­ca­tion and devel­op­ment, while debt re­pay­ment and other eco­nomic poli­cies have been made the pri­or­ity. In ef­fect, the IMF and World Bank have de­manded that poor na­tions lower the stan­dard of living of their peo­ple. The IMF and World Bank pro- vided fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to coun­tries seek­ing it, but ap­plied a ne­olib­eral eco­nomic ide­ol­ogy or agenda as a pre­con­di­tion to re­ceiv­ing the money. Ex­am­ples of th­ese con­di­tions in­clude lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the econ­omy and re­source ex­trac­tion/ex­port-ori­ented open mar­kets, min­imis­ing the role of the state, pri­vati­sa­tion of paras­tatals, cur­rency de­val­u­a­tions and elim­i­na­tion of sub­si­dies. The im­pact of th­ese pre­con­di­tions on poorer coun­tries was dev­as­tat­ing. Fac­tors such as the fol­low­ing lead to fur­ther mis­ery for the de­vel­op­ing na­tions and keep them de­pen­dent on de­vel­oped na­tions: Zim­babwe is a typ­i­cal ex­am­ple of how the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion's poli­cies have im­mensely con­trib­uted to the devel­op­ment para­dox to her devel­op­ment.Zim­babwe's ex­ter­nal debts in­creased dramatically due to heavy SAP-re­lated bor­row­ing and by 2004 it stood at more than 100% of the GDP and 60% of the debt is in ar­rears. The real for­eign ex­change value of ex­ports in Zim­babwe de­clined by an an­nual av­er­age of 2, 7% while it had grown by 9% be­fore SAPs were in­tro­duced and this was mainly due to cur­rency de­val­u­a­tions. Zim­babwe's Eco­nomic Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­gramme (Esap), launched in 1990, was meant to usher in a new era of mod­ern­ized, com­pet­i­tive, ex­port-led in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. But de­spite a high-per­form­ing econ­omy in its first decade of in­de­pen­dence, the coun­try now ap­pears firmly lodged in a quandary of mount­ing debt over­hang and slug­gish growth against the back­ground of Esap-man­dated re­forms. At the same time, price con­trol re­lax­ation saw in­fla­tion ex­plode and con­sumer de­mand shrink, by as much as 30%. In­creas­ing de­pen­dency Sim­i­larly, many de­vel­op­ing na­tions are in debt and poverty partly due to the poli­cies of in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions such as the IMF and the World Bank. Their pro­grammes have been heav­ily crit­i­cised for many years for re­sult­ing in poverty. In ad­di­tion, for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, there has been an in­creased de­pen­dency on the richer na­tions. This is de­spite the IMF and World Bank's claim that they will re­duce poverty. As a re­sult of the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion process, the re­sources from the poorer re­gions be­come even cheaper, which fa­vors con­sumers in the West. One of the many things that the pow­er­ful na­tions (through the IMF, World Bank, etc.) pre­scribe is that the de­vel­op­ing na­tion should open up to al­low more im­ports in and ex­port more of their com­modi­ties. How­ever, this is pre­cisely what con­trib­utes to poverty and de­pen­dency. Trade im­bal­ance Fur­ther to that de­vel­oped coun­tries grow rich by sell­ing cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive (thus cheap) prod­ucts for a high price and buy­ing la­bor-in­ten­sive (thus ex­pen­sive) prod­ucts for a low price. This im­bal­ance of trade ex­pands the gap be­tween rich and poor. The wealthy sell prod­ucts to be con­sumed, not tools to pro­duce. This main­tains the mo­nop­o­li­sa­tion of the tools of pro­duc­tion, and as­sures a con­tin­ued mar­ket for the prod­uct. Such con­trol of tools of pro­duc­tion is a strat­egy of a mer­can­tilist process and this has re­in­forced Africa as a con­ti­nent of com­modi­ties traded un­der un­equal terms. At first glance, it may seem that the growth in devel­op­ment of ex­port goods such as cof­fee, cot­ton, sugar, and lum­ber, would be ben­e­fi­cial to the ex­port­ing coun­try, since it brings in rev­enue. In fact, it rep­re­sents a type of ex­ploita­tion called un­equal ex­change. He ar­gued that a coun­try that ex­ports raw or un­pro­cessed ma­te­ri­als may gain cur­rency for their sale, but they lose it if they im­port pro­cessed goods. The rea­son is that pro­cessed goods that re­quire ad­di­tional la­bor are more costly. Ac­cord­ingly, the World Bank in 2009 re­ported that more than 50 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries de­pend on three or fewer com­modi­ties for over half of their ex­port earn­ings. Twenty coun­tries are de­pen­dent on com­modi­ties for over 90% of their to­tal for­eign ex­change earn­ings. In ad­di­tion, as Tan (2001) of the Third World Net­work ex­plains that fall­ing com­mod­ity prices have meant that large in­creases in ex­port vol­ume by com­mod­ity pro­duc­ers have not trans­lated into greater ex­port rev­enues, lead­ing to se­verely de­clin­ing terms of trade for many com­mod­ity pro­duc­ing coun­tries. Dead-end ac­tiv­i­ties Devel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tion with in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries has so far dic­tated flawed strate­gies to solve Africa's prob­lems. Gen­er­ally, devel­op­ment is syn­ony­mous to in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. If economies in Africa do not move out of dead-end ac­tiv­i­ties that only pro­vide di­min­ish­ing re­turns over time like pri­mary agri­cul­ture, log­ging, and fish­ing, and turn to ac­tiv­i­ties that pro­vide in­creas­ing re­turns over time like man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vices, then devel­op­ment will con­tinue to re­main an illusion, and po­lit­i­cal rhetoric. From the above it can there­fore be de­duced that Africa is poor and un­der­de­vel­oped be­cause it is in­te­grated into the world on un­fa­vor­able terms. Se­condly, re­source ex­ploita­tion has failed to gen­er­ate em­ploy­ment be­cause there is no fur­ther pro­cess­ing of the raw ma­te­ri­als within the ter­ri­tory.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170817,More in­cen­tives can boost agric pro­duc­tion,"THE rev­o­lu­tion­ary na­ture of Zim­babwe’s agrarian revo­lu­tion is indis­putable and that the main ob­jec­tives of the re­forms were achieved. That is a fact! But should we sit down and re­lax now that our farm­ers, with Govern­ment sup­port, have started find­ing their feet in push­ing the fight for food self-sus­te­nance? The farm­ers have proved that they are in the game to stay and have to be kept in it for good. It is a fact that agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion is the main­stay of any coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. The Chi­nese did it af­ter Chair­man Mao’s Cul­tural Revo­lu­tion when Deng Xiaop­ing and the re­form­ers de­cided that eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment was an­chored on agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity. Daron Ace­moglu and James A. Robin­son in their book “Why Na­tions Fail: The Ori­gins of Power, Pros­per­ity and Poverty” note that when Deng and his group had ac­com­plished their po­lit­i­cal revo­lu­tion, they set their tar­gets on the econ­omy. The first port of call for Deng and the re­form­ers, ac­cord­ing to Ace­moglu and Robin­son, was agri­cul­ture which, by 1983, the house­hold re­spon­si­bil­ity sys­tem, which would pro­vide eco­nomic in­cen­tives to farm­ers, was uni­ver­sally adopted. They fur­ther state that in 1985, the manda­tory State pur­chas­ing of grain was aban­doned and re­placed by a sys­tem of more vol­un­tary con­tracts while ad­min­is­tra­tive con­trol of agri­cul­tural prices was greatly re­laxed in 1985. This led, they fur­ther noted, to mas­sive take off of the ru­ral econ­omy with the in­tro­duc­tion of in­cen­tives lead­ing to a dra­matic in­crease in agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity. By 1984, they state, grain out­put was one-third higher than in 1978, though fewer peo­ple were in­volved in agri­cul­ture. We have, as a coun­try, put China as the bench­mark for our eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment through the Look East Pol­icy. Achieve­ments made by China af­ter Deng and the Re­form­ers who took over con­trol of the party and govern­ment are still en­dur­ing with the Asian eco­nomic giant dom­i­nat­ing world eco­nomics. We also need to note that it is through agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion that the econ­omy in China rose be­cause the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship and govern­ment pri­ori­tised pro­duc­tiv­ity to kick-start de­vel­op­ment. Zim­babwe has al­ready started look­ing in the di­rec­tion of in­cen­tivis­ing pro­duc­tion through the Pres­i­den­tial In­put Sup­port Scheme and the Com­mand Agri­cul­ture Pro­gramme. The suc­cess of these pro­grammes can never be over-em­pha­sised. Word within Govern­ment cir­cles is point­ing at en­gag­ing the Di­as­pora so that it can par­tic­i­pate in pro­grammes, es­pe­cially agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. Many Zim­bab­weans, es­pe­cially those based in South Africa, have con­trib­uted im­mensely to that coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment. Zim­bab­weans work­ing in South Africa’s agri­cul­tural in­dus­try are per­form­ing won­ders that their ef­forts have been recog­nised by the high­est of of­fices in that coun­try. Pro­fes­sor Sikha­lazo Dube of the In­ter­na­tional Live­stock Re­search In­sti­tute be­lieves com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of the value chain, es­pe­cially in cat­tle pro­duc­tion, is the way to go. He says the pro­vi­sion of in­cen­tives to live­stock farm­ers, which in­cludes a re-look at the var­i­ous pro­duc­tion and mar­ket­ing costs such as levies was also nec­es­sary. “Im­prove­ment of mar­ket in­fra­struc­ture and re­duc­tion of trans­ac­tion costs is also es­sen­tial. To me de­vel­op­ment of mar­kets and mar­ket link­ages is also vi­tal,” he says. He fur­ther ar­gues that when the pro­duc­tion en­vi­ron­ment is im­proved, the live­stock pro­duc­tion-minded Di­as­pora will find its niche and use its net­works to im­prove trade in live­stock prod­ucts. “Frankly, l am more for the in­cen­tivis­ing of value chain as a whole than just for the sake of Di­as­pora par­tic­i­pa­tion,” he said. Prof Dube has in­tro­duced var­i­ous pro­grammes in Mozam­bique, Swazi­land and Malawi that have been so suc­cess­ful that farm­ers in these coun­tries re­alised thou­sands of US dol­lars through ac­tiv­i­ties such as pen fat­ten­ing. Ex­perts like South Africa-based Dr Florence V. Nher­era-Chokuda could pro­vide the nec­es­sary ex­per­tise as a se­nior re­searcher work­ing on dairy cat­tle nu­tri­tion at the ARC-An­i­mal Pro­duc­tion In­sti­tute. There is also Pro­fes­sor Kennedy Nzama of Stel­len­bosch Univer­sity in the West­ern Cape who has also led a num­ber of re­search pro­grammes we be­lieve can be of ut­most im­por­tance to Zim­babwe. There are sev­eral other pro­fes­sion­als do­ing ex­cep­tional work in the field of agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion and it’s ob­vi­ous that they do not mind as­sist­ing Zim­babwe in its en­deav­our to turn around the econ­omy. The Rhode­sian govern­ment used to sup­port farm­ers to en­sure agri­cul­ture an­chored the econ­omy. The Di­as­pora has so much to con­trib­ute to the de­vel­op­ment of our econ­omy and there is no need to hes­i­tate in en­gag­ing it for their in­put. Those abroad can send their money here, but this does not mea­sure to the ex­per­tise they pos­sess in de­vel­op­ing var­i­ous sec­tors of the econ­omy, es­pe­cially agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. In live­stock pro­duc­tion, cross breed­ing of the dif­fer­ent breeds for Zim­babwe to re­gain its Euro­pean mar­ket, and Zim­bab­wean ex­perts based out­side the coun­try can do that for us. The same can be done to var­i­ous sec­tors of our agri­cul­tural econ­omy where we keep the mo­men­tum is en­sur­ing that pro­duc­tion is main­tained. Re­gain­ing our sta­tus as the bread­bas­ket of South­ern Africa is within reach and it is only the need to in­volve all Zim­bab­weans in our ef­forts to get to the des­tiny. The Di­as­pora would also be com­pli­ment­ing ef­forts be­ing made by var­i­ous re­search in­sti­tu­tions here, in­clud­ing the Sci­en­tific and In­dus­trial Re­search and De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre (Sirdc) and the In­ter­na­tional Crops Re­search In­sti­tute for the Semi-Arid Trop­ics based in Harare and Mato­pos, re­spec­tively. We have the will, the en­ergy and all that is needed is to cap­ture ev­ery Zim­bab­wean who can con­trib­ute to the turn­around of our econ­omy. Feed­back: syd­ney.kawadza @zim­pa­pers. co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171103,Is our so­cial­ism dead?,"IT HAS to be a thor­oughly un­pleas­ant ex­pe­ri­ence, if not trau­matic, to have your par­ent(s) sit you down every evening for lessons on moral­ity. For some of us whose par­ents be­lieved in the virtues of the stick or rod as a handy aid to teach moral val­ues, we will gladly take the stick - any­time. Well, Cde Don Mu­vuti’s kids had to put up with the late com­rade’s daily lec­tures on hunhu or ubuntu. It is one of those things that as a young per­son you will have to dread­fully live through only to thank­fully re­alise its im­por­tance later in life. Moral lessons, like medicine, es­pe­cially tra­di­tional medicine, are bit­ter but very cu­ra­tive. Such traits be­gin to build up the char­ac­ter of the com­rade who was in­terred at the Heroes Acre on Wed­nes­day. Even when he had the politi­cal power and means to amass as much wealth as he pos­si­bly could dur­ing his life, Cde Mu­vuti seem­ingly lived his life on the straight and nar­row. “The President saw it fit that be­cause of his ded­i­ca­tion to duty and hard work with­out ex­pect­ing any mone­tary ben­e­fits, Cde Don Mu­vuti be buried at the Heroes Acre,” were the words de­liv­ered by ZANU-PF’s Sec­re­tary for Ad­min­is­tra­tion, Cde Ig­natius Chombo, at the late hero’s fam­ily home in St Martin’s on Mon­day. In a coun­try that has be­come de­cid­edly ma­te­ri­al­is­tic, rare com­rades such as Mu­vuti, who ob­sti­nately stuck to their ide­o­log­i­cal be­liefs, pro­vide a flicker of hope for the coun­try’s rev­o­lu­tion. Zim­babwe was born out of the bar­rel of the gun wielded by cadres, most of who had been ide­o­log­i­cally ori­ented in com­mu­nist citadels such as Rus­sia (then the Union of Soviet So­cial­ist Re­publics) and China. By im­pli­ca­tion, the na­tion state that re­sulted from the rev­o­lu­tion was a So­cial- ist Repub­lic work­ing for the good of the gen­er­al­ity of Zim­bab­weans, or so it should have been. But Zim­babwe ar­guably did not out­rightly re­pu­di­ate some of the tenets of cap­i­tal­ism, which had been in­her­ited from the Rhode­sian era. Though rev­o­lu­tion­ary lead­ers, es­pe­cially first-gen­er­a­tion rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies, have tried to preach and re­main true to their ideals, the os­ten­ta­tious wealth that comes with cap­i­tal­ism has been dif­fi­cult to re­sist. As a re­sult, the tu­nic suits - most of­ten a sym­bol of so­cial­ist cadres - have given way to tai­lor-made Gior­gio Ar­mani and Loui Vuit­ton suits. Com­mu­nity-hood, which is not only a so­cial­ist at­tribute, but a quintessen­tially tra­di­tional African con­cept, has slowly given way to in­di­vid­u­al­ism. Today, the bru­tal re­al­i­ties of the ex­cesses of cap­i­tal­ism con­front us at every turn. They con­front us in up­town restau­rants, where a mi­nor­ity de­lights in sushi and prawns, while count­less guests in down­turn restau­rants are con­tent with poorly pre­pared sadza served with a heavy dose of veg­eta­bles and charred pieces that pass for meat. They con­front us in up­town pubs where the few well-heeled in our midst are set back by thou­sands of green­backs in one night, while the bulk of down­town im­bibers have to make do with un­wieldy brown plas­tic con­tain­ers of opaque beer. They even con­front us at politi­cal ral­lies, where mon­strous cars driven by the elite are parked to form a mock car show of sorts in front of poor coun­try­men. While this is not nec­es­sar­ily crim­i­nal, such con­tra­dic­tions in a repub­lic that is sup­posed to be so­cial­ist are noth­ing short of wor­ry­ing. And this is why com­rades such as Mu­vuti and a few of his peers, liv­ing or buried at the sa­cred shrine, are so sym­bolic at this junc­ture in our rev­o­lu­tion. It is in­creas­ingly likely that ZANU-PF is go­ing to form the next Govern­ment af­ter the 2018 har­monised elec­tions, as the num­ber of po­ten­tial vot­ers reg­is­tered so far, par­tic­u­larly in the rul­ing party’s strongholds, looks omi­nous for the op­po­si­tion. The two prov­inces that the op­po­si­tion had a stran­gle­hold on in 2013 have only man­aged to reg­is­ter 273 617 po­ten­tial vot­ers, while the re­main­ing eight prov­inces - in­clud­ing Mashona­land Cen­tral, Masvingo and Mata­bele­land South, where ZANU-PF swept all seats - now have a whop­ping 1,15 mil­lion vot­ers in their book. In Mashona­land East and Mashona­land West, where ZANU-PF did not man­age to have a clean sweep, it only dropped a sin­gle seat in ei­ther prov­ince. If this is not telling enough, then noth­ing is. Most im­por­tantly, this means elec­tions no longer pose an ex­is­ten­tial ques­tion for the rul­ing party, rather the party now has to plan for a com­pre­hen­sive plan to “lift” the peo­ple from poverty. And quite in­struc­tively, this en­tails de­stroy­ing the cur­rent ar­chi­tec­ture of an ob­scenely cap­i­tal­ist sys­tem that is threat­en­ing to un­der­mine the foun­da­tions and ideals of the Zim­bab­wean State. Just be­cause the ma­jor­ity of Zim­bab­weans trust ZANU-PF with power - in the same man­ner the Chi­nese have trusted the China Com­mu­nist Party (CPC) with power since 1921v- this does not mean that they do not have griev­ances about their wel­fare. And this must be ad­dressed. Con­tra­dic­tions be­tween cap­i­tal­ism and so­cial­ism are not pe­cu­liar to Zim­babwe. When eco­nomic re­forms be­gan in China, the same con­tra­dic­tions be­came more ap­par­ent. Not only were there a threat for China’s so­cial­ism, they were also a threat to China’s eco­nomic re­form process. Try­ing to come up with an econ­omy that was planned and at the same time em­brac­ing free en­ter­prise be­came prob­lem­atic. Shen­zhen, which was des­ig­nated as a Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zone (SEZ) - where con­di­tions, as dic­tated by Com­mu­nist and So­cial­ist teach­ings, were re­laxed - evolved as cen­tre of cap­i­tal­ism, which in­evitably set tongues wag­ging. As writer Wu Xiaobo noted in his book “China Emerg­ing (1978-2008): How Think­ing About Busi­ness Changed”, “other than a five-star Chi­nese flag, you can­not even find a sin­gle bit of so­cial­ism in this place”. The Chi­nese were even warned to guard against the reap­pear­ance of “com­pradores”, those peo­ple who sold out the coun­try by serv­ing as in­ter­me­di­aries for Western busi­nesses. Thank­fully, the CPC, un­der the able lead­er­ship of its leader Deng Xiaop­ing, man­aged to clar­ify th­ese con­tra­dic­tions and pro­vide a plat­form for fu­ture Chi­nese eco­nomic growth. “The ba­sic route of the party will not change for one hun­dred years. In de­ter­min­ing the stan­dards by which we judge our work, we should con­sider whether or not the re­sult is ben­e­fi­cial to the pro­duc­tiv­ity and growth of our so­cial­ist so­ci­ety. Is it ben­e­fi­cial to raise the peo­ple’s stan­dard of liv­ing? “The ba­sic qual­ity of so­cial­ism is to re­lease pro­duc­tiv­ity, de­velop pro­duc­tiv­ity, elim­i­nate ex­ploita­tion, elim­i­nate ex­trem­ism. Its aim is to fi­nally ar­rive at com­mon pros­per­ity,” said the Chi­nese leader. He added: “China should be on guard against right­ism, but even more im­por­tantly, it should pre­vent left­ism.” Yes, as was, and still is, the as­pi­ra­tion of many ZANU-PF cadres, the rev­o­lu­tion must stay on course. ZANU-PF should, con­trary to in­di­vid­u­al­ist ten­den­cies of some com­rades we see today, “aim to ar­rive at com­mon pros­per­ity”. Also, ZANU-PF should nec­es­sar­ily re­ject right­ism (the ex­cesses of cap­i­tal­ism) and, by equal mea­sure, left­ism (im­prac­ti­cal ide­o­log­i­cal lean­ings that hold the coun­try back). Cor­rup­tion and in­dis­ci­pline are ar­guably the big­gest chal­lenges to the as­pi­ra­tions of the rev­o­lu­tion today. Sim­i­larly, the CPC has over the years faced the same chal­lenges, but it has been ruth­less, es­pe­cially un­der the lead­er­ship of Xi Jin­ping. ZANU-PF has to act and if need be “through blood and iron” to crush the two new can­cers of in­dis­ci­pline and cor­rup­tion, lest they con­tinue to eat away the party and the rev­o­lu­tion from within. It is ar­guable that the in­er­tia in im­ple­ment­ing Govern­ment pol­icy at times is blocked by com­rades who have in­ter­ests in those tar­geted sec­tors. So, it has be­come ur­gent for the party to ad­dress th­ese press­ing is­sues. The party must con­tinue to spawn self­less, blame­less and in­cor­rupt­ible cadres like Cde Don Mu­vuti, or we are doomed. ◆ Feed­back: dar­ling­ton.musarurwa@ zim­pa­pers.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20180930,Fail­ure to read the signs: Curse of a gen­er­a­tion,"DOOMS­DAY crit­ics are hav­ing a field day, es­pe­cially on so­cial me­dia. For them, signs of an im­mi­nent eco­nomic im­plo­sion they pre­dicted – which they be­lieve is a di­rect re­sult of hav­ing a Zanu-PF Gov­ern­ment in power – are ev­ery­where. For the first time last week, US$100 was be­ing ex­changed for $210 bond notes, as the lat­ter con­tin­ued to lose ground. Prices, es­pe­cially of ba­sic com­modi­ties, con­tinue to creep up. And, yes, the crit­ics also point to a grow­ing neg­a­tive trade bal­ance too. By June this year, the coun­try’s trade deficit had widened by 44 per­cent to $1,4 bil­lion from $1 bil­lion in the same pe­riod last year. All this, they say, is a sign that the sky is fall­ing. And how this is pos­si­ble, where tobacco pro­duc­tion has risen to a re­mark­able 250 mil­lion kilo­grammes – the high­est ever recorded since com­mer­cial pro­duc­tion be­gan in 1894; and maize pro­duc­tion has jumped to more than 1 mil­lion met­ric tonnes – guar­an­tee­ing food se­cu­rity and re­duced im­ports – is dif­fi­cult to rec­on­cile. Dur­ing the 2018 mar­ket­ing sea­son, cot­ton de­liv­er­ies have also risen the most in five years at 130 000 tonnes from 70 000 tonnes last year, a 76 per­cent jump. It is dif­fi­cult to also rec­on­cile how an econ­omy can tank when gold pro­duc­tion, which has head­lined a stel­lar per­for­mance in the sec­tor, has since matched last year’s out­put of 24,8 tonnes, with four months to go be­fore year-end. So, over­all, it is un­con­scionable to have an ane­mic econ­omy at a time when it is re­ceiv­ing crit­i­cal lifeblood from agri­cul­ture and min­ing. Fail­ing to read the signs That the econ­omy is not in good shape can­not be dis­puted, but that it is col­laps­ing, par­tic­u­larly when the eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals are get­ting even stronger, is im­plau­si­ble. A nu­anced in­ter­ro­ga­tion and in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the num­bers can prove quite help­ful. While the coun­try con­tin­ues to im­port more than it ex­ports, the con­sump­tion pat­terns have shifted to­wards the im­port of cap­i­tal goods. The pro-busi­ness drive of the new ad­min­is­tra­tion seems to be res­onat­ing in in­dus­try. In the six-month pe­riod to June 30, the im­port of con­sumer goods fell by 34 per­cent. The trend con­tin­ued in July, where en­ergy im­ports – fuel and elec­tric­ity – rose to $143 mil­lion, which is 42 per­cent of the monthly im­port bill. Most no­tably, ma­chin­ery im­ports jumped to $15 mil­lion from $1 mil­lion in the same pe­riod a year ear­lier. It is not sur­pris­ing that as in­dus­try re­cov­ers, it is de­vel­op­ing a glut­tonous ap­petite and de­mand for hard cur­rency, which or­di­nar­ily is not read­ily avail­able on the for­mal mar­ket. It there­fore be­comes clear that the par­al­lel mar­ket rates are mainly be­ing driven by com­pa­nies. De­mand for fuel, ac­cord­ing to en­ergy reg­u­la­tor Zim­babwe En­ergy Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Zera), has also been pro­gres­sively ris­ing since the be­gin­ning of the year. In the Jan­uary to March pe­riod, diesel and petrol con­sump­tion rose 8,5 per­cent and 22 per­cent, re­spec­tively, from the same pe­riod in 2017, while con­sump­tion of Jet A1 fuel soared by 35 per­cent. The ex­po­nen­tial growth in de­mand has since forced the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe (RBZ) to in­crease for­eign cur­rency al­lo­ca­tions for fuel im­porters from $12 mil­lion to $20 mil­lion per week. Ac­cord­ing to the time-tested law of de­mand and sup­ply, where mis­matches of de­mand and sup­ply oc­cur, ar­bi­trage nat­u­rally kicks in and, in our case, the premium that con­tin­ues to be placed on the scarce US dol­lar con­tin­ues to rise and, with it, the price of com­modi­ties. Proven eco­nomic phe­nom­ena The paradox of seem­ingly con­flict­ual eco­nomic vari­ables, where growth – as ev­i­denced by pro­duc­tion and ex­ports (which has risen 16 per­cent in the Jan­uary-June pe­riod – co-ex­ists with raw ma­te­rial short­ages and price in­creases has been stud­ied and noted by de­vel­op­ment economists. Coin­ci­den­tally, it is the same dis­ease that af­fected China when it em­barked on a mis­sion to lift its peo­ple out of poverty. Sim­i­lar to the cur­rent path that is be­ing taken by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, Deng Xiaop­ing tried to open up China to in­vest­ment and drive and am­bi­tious agenda of eco­nomic growth when he took over in March 1978. Eco­nomic con­di­tions pro­gres­sively im­proved, but in 1985, barely seven years af­ter sweep­ing eco­nomic re­forms, the Asian coun­try ran into ex­actly the same prob­lems that the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy – with the added in­con­ve­nience of sanc­tions from the US – is presently grap­pling with. As Chi­nese com­pa­nies im­ported more raw ma­te­ri­als and ma­chin­ery for in­dus­try, the coun­try trade bal­ance de­te­ri­o­rated markedly. In his book “China Emerg­ing: How think­ing about Busi­ness Changed” (2008), au­thor Wu Xiaobo aptly cap­tured this trend. “Through­out Europe, Chi­nese del­e­ga­tions can be seen with their hands clutch­ing lists of things they want to buy, look­ing for sec­ond-hand fac­to­ries and equip­ment. . . By the end of 1985, China’s neg­a­tive trade bal­ance stood at a record $13,78 bil­lion, about 52 per­cent of its ex­ports. “Due to over­heat­ing, en­ter­prises soon were fac­ing short­ages of raw ma­te­ri­als. In order to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of State-owned en­ter­prises, the gov­ern­ment fi­nally set­tled on a pol­icy of a “two-track pric­ing sys­tem”. This de­ci­sion was to lead China into a cat­a­clysmic up­heaval,” noted Wu. It got even worse three years later, in 1988, when an Amer­i­can eco­nomic ex­pert Mil­ton Friedman (a No­bel prize win­ner in eco­nom­ics), who vis­ited China in the same year, man­aged to con­vince Bei­jing to re­move price con­trols and dis­band the two-track pric­ing sys­tem, which pre­scribed dif­fer­ent prices for raw ma­te­ri­als for SOEs, on the one hand, and pri­vate en­ter­prises on the other. Adds Wu: “The pol­icy and its reper­cus­sions quickly rip­pled across the en­tire coun­try. Start­ing in May (1988), the prices of pork and other meats in the ma­jor ur­ban cen­tres rose by an av­er­age of 70 per­cent, and the price of small items rose swiftly on the heels of food prices. “Ac­cord­ing to con­tem­po­rary re­ports, “Peo­ple started buy­ing what­ever they saw in front of them, as if in a daze. They bought durables, but they also bought con­sumer goods and even what had pre­vi­ously been un­saleable items. If a tele­vi­sion screen showed any kind of im­age, they bought it. If a fan could ro­tate, they bought it. . .” China’s State Price Con­trol Bu­reau noted that prices rose by over 95 per­cent among 383 com­mod­ity prices. In Oc­to­ber, China re­versed the de­ci­sion, but con­tin­ued with its re­forms, which have since trans­formed the coun­try from an eco­nomic back­wa­ter to the world’s sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy and a global su­per­power within three decades. Stay­ing the course It should be noted that this took place 10 years af­ter the coun­try be­gan its re­forms. China’s ex­am­ple is fit­ting be­cause it is one of the coun­tries, if not the only coun­try, which has pur­sued its own course of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment that is unique to its own cir­cum­stances. De­spite ill-will from the West, who cham­pion cap­i­tal­ism as the only prac­ti­ca­ble ide­ol­ogy, China’s eco­nomic mir­a­cle is also in­struc­tive to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as Zim­babwe. Again, the Chi­nese ex­am­ple out­lined above shows that there is noth­ing pe­cu­liar to the cir­cum­stances that the coun­try cur­rently finds it­self in. There are in­her­ent speed bumps in Zim­babwe’s jour­ney to cre­ate an up­per mid­dle-in­come econ­omy by 2030. Mind­set In­stead of ex­pend­ing en­ergy on un­nec­es­sary causes, it is time for Zim­bab­weans, as Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has im­plored, to put all hands on deck. As philoso­phers have of­ten noted, any ma­jor change in his­tory must be pre­ceded by a change in the peo­ple’s con­cep­tual frame­work. Deputy Chief Sec­re­tary to the Of­fice of the Pres­i­dent and Cab­i­net (Pres­i­den­tial Com­mu­ni­ca­tions), Mr George Charamba made the same point in an in­ter­view with Cap­italk FM on Jan­uary 11 this year. “A new era is not made by dec­la­ra­tion, but by change of mind­set and rou­tine. “This is ex­actly where we’re lag­ging be­hind. We have peo­ple who are pro­claim­ing a new era but still have an old mind­set. “We just have to re-in­vent our­selves, not only as Gov­ern­ment but as the pri­vate sec­tor and every ci­ti­zen of this coun­try so that we make the new era a re­al­ity on the ground,” he said. Just as the coun­try has de­cided to pri­ori­tise ease of do­ing busi­ness re­forms, both the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors should also pri­ori­tise re­form­ing the way we do things. Restor­ing the na­tion’s work ethic and get­ting rid of sloth is an ideal start­ing point. Much is talked about the work ethic of the Chi­nese, but it should be noted that this is not an in­born at­tribute. Suf­fice to say, it is not by na­ture, but it can be nur­tured. In his book, Wu Xiaobo tells a story of a Hong Kong scholar who vis­ited Guangzhou in 1979, a year af­ter the re­forms. He no­ticed from his ho­tel room that it took three peo­ple to re­pair a plas­ter on a nearby wall. One held the bucket, an­other ap­plied the plas­ter and the third stood to watch. At­ti­tudes can­not change on their own ac­cord, but it takes a con­scious ef­fort to change them. Walk our own path It is very en­cour­ag­ing that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has made a com­mit­ment to deepen re­form and base his poli­cies on sci­en­tific- and ev­i­dence-based for­mu­las. At a time when ad­vise is be­ing vol­un­teered from every quar­ter, in­clud­ing from sus­pi­cious quar­ters, the coun­try has to chart its own path as dic­tated by its own cir­cum­stances. How China’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment al­most un­rav­eled based on ad­vice from Mil­ton Friedman – an econ­o­mist who be­lieved in “eco­nomic free­dom” and “free mar­kets” and was known for his work on “price the­ory” and “mone­tary the­ory” – is quite in­struc­tive. Of late, there have been grow­ing calls for the bond note to be scrapped sup­pos­edly be­cause it is los­ing value on the par­al­lel mar­ket. But this con­ve­niently fails to ad­dress how it can be un­wound from the mar­ket since the sur­ro­gate cur­rency was rolled out as a ex­port in­cen­tive. For ex­am­ple, is it pos­si­ble to scrap it and still main­tain the ex­port in­cen­tive of 12 per­cent for both tobacco farm­ers and gold pro­duc­ers, and af­ford to pay it in US dol­lars? Isn’t the in­crease in gold de­liv­er­ies and out­put of small-scale tobacco pro­duc­ers not linked to the in­cen­tive? The bot­tom line is, there is need for a white pa­per to pro­pose the most sci­en­tific and prac­ti­ca­ble method to im­ple­ment lo­cal cur­rency re­forms. And I have no doubt that Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube, given his com­pe­ten­cies and track record, is the right per­son to mod­er­ate this key de­bate. But there is no doubt that we are def­i­nitely on the right track. How­ever, more still needs to be done. It won’t be easy, but this doesn’t mean it can’t be done. Science and tech­nol­ogy, as has be­come ev­i­dent through the Fourth Revo­lu­tion, makes it pos­si­ble to im­prove ef­fi­cien­cies and the ef­fec­tive­ness of our na­tional sys­tems, and can help the coun­try leapfrog de­vel­op­ment. A gen­er­a­tion that can­not read the signs ul­ti­mately curses it­self. We owe it to our­selves and to pos­ter­ity to live Zim­babwe a bet­ter and pros­per­ous State. It is, there­fore, a his­tor­i­cal ex­pec­ta­tion for this gen­er­a­tion to rise above po­lit­i­cal trib­al­ism to build our own coun­try.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200210,OAFLAD seeks to im­prove women’s health,"WOMEN across Africa stand to reap im­mense ben­e­fits from the meet­ing of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African First Ladies for De­vel­op­ment(OAFLAD) un­der­way here to find ways of im­prov­ing their health, sta­tus and con­tri­bu­tion to the economies of their na­tions. The 2020 theme for OAFLAD is, “Gen­der Equal­ity and Women Em­pow­er­ment: A Path­way to the Africa We Want”, and it speaks to the need to un­lock po­ten­tial for African women. First Lady Aux­il­lia Mnan­gagwa is the vice pres­i­dent of OAFLAD, a post she got in recog­ni­tion of her un­wa­ver­ing ef­forts in im­prov­ing the health and wel­fare of women. The meet­ing of the First Ladies is tak­ing place on the side­lines of the African Union (AU) sum­mit. An in­vi­ta­tion ex­tended by Amai Mnan­gagwa to other African First Ladies to visit Zim­babwe for a two-day con­fer­ence on bil­harzia has since been ac­cepted. Yes­ter­day, the OAFLAD mem­bers held a closed-door meet­ing to brain­storm on rec­om­men­da­tions pre­sented to them by the tech­ni­cal ad­vi­sory team. They are ex­pected to con­vene again to­day for their 24th Or­di­nary Gen­eral As­sem­bly where they will de­lib­er­ate on key is­sues and agree on a roadmap that will guar­an­tee gen­der equal­ity. Ac­cord­ing to ex­perts, an in­crease in aware­ness for women’s lib­er­a­tion, changes in prac­tices and me­dia ad­vo­cacy with re­spect to their rep­re­sen­ta­tion, have as yet failed to yield the de­sired re­sults in Africa mainly be­cause of the re­sis­tance to change that is firmly en­trenched in pa­tri­ar­chal ide­olo­gies. Fem­i­nists ar­gue that op­pres­sion of women is rooted in class struc­ture, un­paid labour, sex and re­pro­duc­tion. Women in Africa have al­ways been noted for ac­tiv­i­ties such as pro­cre­ation, child care and house­hold chores. The roles of women have been lim­ited to the home while eco­nomic and cul­tural is­sues are at the mercy of men. Ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP), gen­der inequal­ity re­mains a ma­jor bar­rier to hu­man de­vel­op­ment. UNDP says girls and women have made ma­jor strides, but they have not yet gained gen­der eq­uity. The or­gan­i­sa­tion fur­ther high­lighted that dis­ad­van­tages fac­ing women and girls were a ma­jor source of inequal­ity adding that women and girls are dis­crim­i­nated against in health, ed­u­ca­tion, po­lit­i­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tion and labour mar­ket with neg­a­tive con­se­quences. In a ban­ner on dis­play here, Amai Mnan­gagwa has cap­tured the imag­i­na­tion of var­i­ous guests through her mes­sage: “We should stand against in­tim­i­da­tion of women for their choice to con­trol their health and fer­til­ity.” The state­ment is loaded and ad­dresses the treat­ment of women across Africa. Driven by a pas­sion to eco­nom­i­cally em­power women in Zim­babwe, Amai Mnan­gagwa has, through her An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion, of­fered ed­u­ca­tional schol­ar­ships to girls so that they can re­alise their dreams. She has also helped women across the coun­try to start in­come-gen­er­at­ing projects. The First Lady has also gone out of her way to in­volve ex­perts and hold coun­selling ses­sions to in­fer­tile cou­ples, a chal­lenge which so­ci­ety as­cribes to women. She en­cour­ages women to take up lead­er­ship po­si­tions even at work­places so that their voices are heard. Amai Mnan­gagwa also roped in ex­perts and lawyers to ad­dress com­mu­ni­ties on the is­sue of in­her­i­tance as a way of em­pow­er­ing mostly women. Most fam­i­lies have been left wal­low­ing in poverty fol­low­ing the death of the bread­win­ners where­upon rel­a­tives grab prop­erty from the fam­i­lies. Wid­ows and or­phans have had houses, ve­hi­cles and other valu­ables snatched from them by greedy rel­a­tives who also of­ten chase them away from their mat­ri­mo­nial homes. As a way of em­pow­er­ing women, busi­ness-wise, the First Lady has taken women busi­nessper­sons to var­i­ous sum­mits to ex­pose them to var­i­ous trends like the women in tourism whom she re­cently took on a trip to Ghana. She also took women in busi­ness to China where they met and shared notes with their coun­ter­parts on how best they could con­trib­ute mean­ing­fully to the coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. OAFLAD plays a crit­i­cal role in ad­vo­cat­ing the em­pow­er­ment of women and fundrais­ing for var­i­ous causes like health, HIV/Aids and nat­u­ral dis­as­ters.",津巴布韦

While it pro­poses that gov­ern­ments as­sist to­bacco pro­duc­ers, as­sum­ing that they will be un­der long-term im­pacts with the re­duc­tion in de­mand for to­bacco, WHO has not in­cluded the same farm­ers in the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process de­spite re­peated ap­peals. In­stead, farm­ers’ pleas have been dis­missed as “in­ter­fer­ences”. This prompted demon­stra­tions by In­dian farm­ers against what they call a “non- demo­cratic” way of fram­ing poli­cies at the on­go­ing global con­fer­ence. They said that WHO’s FCTC con­fer­ence will neg­a­tively im­pact the lives and liveli­hoods of mil­lions of In­di­ans as­so­ci­ated with the to­bacco in­dus­try. “To­bacco con­trol mea­sures need to be more in­clu­sive and should not be de­cided only by health of­fi­cials and ac­tivists, but should al­low par­tic­i­pa­tion from to­bacco grow­ers and re­al­is­ti­cally ac­knowl­edge the prob­lems they face,” said Mu­rali Babu, gen­eral sec­re­tary of Fed­er­a­tion of All In­dia Farmer As­so­ci­a­tions. While In­dian farm­ers were at the front and cen­tre at the demon­stra­tions in Greater Noida, mil­lions more to­bacco farm­ers, par­tic­u­larly in Africa, are sim­i­larly piqued that their fate could be sealed by peo­ple who do not have their in­ter­ests at heart. The In­ter­na­tional To­bacco Grow­ers As­so­ci­a­tion has also ex­pressed its con­cern with the WHO FCTC not­ing that grow­ers are seek­ing proper con­sul­ta­tion and ac­tive par­tic­i­pa­tion in the devel­op­ment of poli­cies di­rectly af­fect­ing them. “Grow­ers also want recog­ni­tion of the sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic con­tri­bu­tion to­bacco grow­ing brings to their na­tional economies, and solid im­pact as­sess­ments to be car­ried out when the Con­ven­tion pro­poses mea­sures. To­bacco is not only an im­por­tant, but in most cases, the main cash crop for many agri­cul­ture-based economies, and it helps to en­hance the liveli­hoods of mil­lions of farm­ers, ru­ral work­ers and their fam­i­lies across the globe,” said the ITGA in a state­ment. South­ern African coun­tries have been ma­jor pro­duc­ers of to­bacco over the past decades and have markedly in­creased re­liance on ex­port re­ceipts from the crop. Zim­babwe, Zam­bia and Malawi are among the high­est pro­duc­ers of the golden leaf in the world. Malawi has be­come one of the five largest to­bacco pro­duc­ers in the world, with sales con­sti­tut­ing 70 per­cent of Malawi’s in­come. But 10 years af­ter the sign­ing of the treaty, some of Malawi’s ma­jor to­bacco buy­ers have started im­ple­ment­ing the FCTC, ob­vi­ously lead­ing to re­duced de­mand. With al­ready high lev­els of poverty, Malawi could plunge deeper into poverty af­fect­ing mil­lions of ru­ral folk who work in to­bacco field. The same ap­plies to Zam­bia. Zam­bia has come out and said ban­ning to­bacco pro­duc­tion and trade is not an op­tion con­sid­er­ing the num­ber of ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties who rely on the crop for sur­vival. Ear­lier this year, Zam­bia’s agri­cul­ture deputy min­is­ter Maxas Ng’onga said a ban on to­bacco pro­duc­tion and trade would worsen poverty. Ac­cord­ing to him, Zam­bia can­not man­age to ig­nore the to­bacco in­dus­try which con­trib­utes three per­cent to GDP and em­ploys more than 450 000 peo­ple gen­er­at­ing much­needed for­eign ex­change through ex­ports. Zim­babwe to­bacco in­dus­try of­fi­cials have also said adopt­ing anti-to­bacco poli­cies will crip­ple the econ­omy.The country com­mands an im­por­tant po­si­tion in the global to­bacco mar­ket ac­count­ing for 20 per­cent of the world’s f lue- cured to­bacco out­put. To­bacco has earned the country more than US$600 mil­lion in ex­port rev­enues as at Novem­ber 10 this year. It con­trib­utes about 30 per­cent of to­tal ex­ports and nearly 10 per­cent of GDP to di­rectly ben­e­fit more than a mil­lion peo­ple. The num­ber of to­bacco grow­ers has grown sig­nif­i­cantly in the past two decades to reach 100 000. With so many African peo­ple re­ly­ing on pro­ceeds from to­bacco, an­a­lysts have ques­tioned if African pro­duc­ers did not shoot them­selves in the foot by sign­ing the anti-to- bacco treaty. Be­cause in the years since the adop­tion of the treaty, Chile, Rus­sia and China among many other ma­jor to­bacco con­sumers, have put in place tough reg­u­la­tions to re­duce pub­lic smok­ing which has seen the de­mand for cig­a­rettes go­ing down sig­nif­i­cantly. It is not sur­pris­ing that rev­enues from to­bacco could start de­clin­ing and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that rely on to­bacco will be the first to suf­fer. What the FCTC is re­ally seek­ing is to even­tu­ally phase out to­bacco pro­duc­tion. But with­out any fall back so­lu­tions, Africa is doomed. De­spite ac­knowl­edg­ing the health con­cerns sur­round­ing smok­ing to­bacco, which is among the dead­li­est killers glob­ally, African economies need to sur­vive. Con­sid­er­ing the slump in prices of min­er­als, which has af­fected most African economies’ growth, a to­bacco ban could bring economies to their knees. So this could be the wake-up call that these na­tions need to start di­ver­si­fy­ing away from min­er­als and to­bacco. But for that to hap­pen, Africa needs new strate­gies go­ing for­ward. Al­though Ar­ti­cles 17 and 18 fo­cus on the pro­vi­sion of eco­nom­i­cally sus­tain­able al­ter­na­tives to to­bacco grow­ing and pro­tec­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment, very lit­tle re­search on al­ter­na­tive, eco­nom­i­cally vi­able crops has been un­der­taken. Farm­ers need vi­able so­lu­tions to en­sure a sus­tain­able fu­ture for them and their fam­i­lies. If those so­lu­tions do not come from the FCTC con­fer­ence, then Africa could have a prob­lem where poli­cies keep be­ing im­ple­mented with no end to the prob­lem in sight. “Grow­ers and their as­so­ci­a­tions recog­nise the need to try to curb to­bacco con­sump­tion but, for more than a decade since its in­cep­tion, de­spite re­peated re­quests to par­tic­i­pate in the bi­en­nial FCTC COP meet­ings, they have not been af­forded one sin­gle op­por­tu­nity to present the re­al­i­ties of their sec­tor. “The con­ven­tion con­tin­ues to grossly un­der­es­ti­mate the con­se­quences of the mea­sures it pro­poses, re­fus­ing to ac­knowl­edge that most will ir­repara­bly dam­age liveli­hoods of mil­lions of to­bacco-grow­ers and their fam­i­lies — of­ten in the world’s poor­est coun­tries — while still fail­ing to curb con­sump­tion,” read the ITGA state­ment. Maybe, just maybe, pro­hi­bi­tion of to­bacco prod­ucts might not the best so­lu­tion.This will just re­sult in to­bacco prod­ucts be­ing smug­gled through other chan­nels into those coun­tries that have en­forced pro­hibitory mea­sures. And they will still have many smok­ing re­lated deaths.

zw,The Manica Post,20180518,Huge progress on dam: Hail new dis­pen­sa­tion,"PRES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa’s ad­min­is­tra­tion must be hailed for its pri­ori­ti­sa­tion and de­sire to com­plete Marowany­ati Dam in Buhera. The dam project had stalled for the past 10 years de­spite its po­ten­tial to pos­i­tively im­pact ru­ral de­vel­op­ment. It is Buhera’s flag­ship of hope as its in­tended pur­pose is to pro­vide do­mes­tic, in­dus­trial wa­ter sup­ply to Mu­ram­binda and ir­ri­ga­tion of 3 650ha of agri­cul­tural land. The con­tract was awarded to China Jiangxi In­ter­na­tional Corporation (CJIC) at a price of Z$2,096,519,660.00 in Au­gust 2002 and con­struc­tion com­menced in Novem­ber 2003 amid pomp and fun-fare. It was ex­pected to be com­plete in 2009, but it stalled in Novem­ber 2007 due to lack of fund­ing. The vil­lagers, who re­lied on donor-aid, hail the new dis­pen­sa­tion for its vi­sion to ad­dress peren­nial wa­ter short­age in the dis­trict by mo­bil­is­ing ad­e­quate fi­nan­cial re­sources to com­plete the project by the end of the year. It was al­lo­cated $8.2 mil­lion and Gov­ern­ment has re­li­giously paid more than $19,5m to the CJIC and as­sured the con­trac­tor that more funds will be availed. Con­struc­tion is in full throt­tle, with the project now at 47 per­cent. At least $33 mil­lion is re­quired. Im­proved wa­ter avail­abil­ity will en­able the com­mu­nity to es­tab­lish gar­dens to ad­dress food se­cu­rity and nu­tri­tional needs; em­bark on aqua­cul­ture and ir­ri­ga­tion schemes; en­sure ad­e­quate live­stock drink­ing wa­ter sup­plies as well as wash down sup­ply for in­dus­tries, among oth­ers chief ben­e­fits. Buhera is a drought prone dis­trict, and the gi­gan­tic wa­ter body will store wa­ter when it is more plen­ti­ful in the wet sea­son for use dur­ing the dry sea­son or droughts. Only a small pro­por­tion of dam wa­ter will come from di­rect rain­fall, there­fore har­ness­ing runoff from the peren­nial Mw­er­i­hari River catch­ment is nec­es­sary. The scarcity of wa­ter re­sources in Buhera for hu­man, cat­tle, and farm­ing has been se­verely ac­cel­er­ated by neg­a­tive cli­mate change. This has brought about eco­nomic prob­lems for ru­ral so­ci­ety, as some fields are con­tin­u­ously aban­doned as they can­not be cul­ti­vated with­out ir­ri­ga­tion. De­mand for fresh wa­ter is very high in Buhera, mak­ing the engi­neer­ing of the dam a vi­tal part of the civil­i­sa­tion. Cer­tainly, Marovany­ati will be a vi­tal cog in the de­vel­op­ment Buhera — an en­tirely com­mu­nal dis­trict — whose quest for growth is stam­peded by a deadly blend of er­ratic rains and bru­tal dry spell. The im­pact of in­vest­ing in this gi­gan­tic wa­ter reser­voir and its po­ten­tial to ame­lio­rate de­vel­op­ment and over­haul­ing the agri­cul­tural com­plex­ion of the dis­trict is in­escapable. The fu­ture wealth of Buhera hinges on Marovany­ati Dam and new dis­pen­sa­tion must be ap­plauded for its fu­tur­is­tic vi­sion. De­mand for wa­ter is a ba­sic hu­man right, and we ap­pre­ci­ate Gov­ern­ment’s sen­si­tiv­ity in this re­gard. Ir­ri­ga­tion projects span­ning 3 600 hectares are ear­marked on its com­ple­tion. This will cre­ate em­ploy­ment, im­prove food and nu­tri­tional se­cu­rity and help pre­vent the mi­gra­tion of ru­ral peo­ple to the cities. Ex­pan­sion of Mu­ram­binda into a town en­tails high pop­u­la­tion growth and a cor­re­spond­ing de­mand of wa­ter to equalise ba­sic civic ser­vices — like tap wa­ter, san­i­ta­tion, in­dus­trial use and food pro­duc­tion. The link be­tween poverty and de­fi­cient wa­ter re­sources is ob­vi­ous. Buhera is one dis­trict with folks that sur­vive on less than $1,25 per day and this co­in­cides with the num­ber of those with­out ac­cess to multi-pur­pose wa­ter re­sources.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20170813,Trade as an en­gine for in­clu­sive growth in Africa,"IN eco­nomic terms, as de­fined by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-oper­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD), in­clu­sive growth means growth that cre­ates op­por­tu­nity for all seg­ments of pop­u­la­tions and dis­trib­utes the div­i­dends of in­creased pros­per­ity, in non-and mon­e­tary terms, fairly across so­ci­ety. The is­sue of “in­clu­sive growth” has be­come eco­nom­i­cally and po­lit­i­cally im­por­tant in Africa’s con­ti­nen­tal, re­gional and na­tional dis­cus­sions, just as in re­cent global meet­ings of the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF), OECD, the World Bank, the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) and the World Eco­nomic Forum (WEF), among oth­ers. Key to this is the in­creas­ing fo­cus on achiev­ing in­clu­sive growth — which re­lates to in­ter alia, poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, em­ploy­ment gen­er­a­tion, youth and women em­ploy­ment and de­vel­op­ment as well as even dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth. The African Union has con­sis­tently ac­cen­tu­ated the need to achieve in­clu­sive growth in the con­ti­nent and, ac­cord­ingly, in­cluded it in pol­icy in­stru­ments such as the Agenda 2063 and the Dec­la­ra­tion and Plan of Ac­tion on Em­ploy­ment, Poverty Erad­i­ca­tion and In­clu­sive De­vel­op­ment of 2014, among oth­ers. How­ever, the topic of achiev­ing in­clu­sive growth re­mains more of an as­pi­ra­tion or dis­cus­sion than an ac­tion agenda in many oc­ca­sions. The African Eco­nomic Out­look (2017) shows that un­em­ploy­ment, in­come and gen­der in­equal­ity, poor in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment and poverty con­tinue to re­main high in Africa. Trade has been iden­ti­fied as a key tool for in­clu­sive growth by global lead­ers. Nonethe­less, there are dif­fer­ent views on the role of trade in driv­ing in­clu­sive growth. For in­stance, op­po­nents of free trade doubt trade as an en­gine for in­clu­sive growth and, in fact, view it as a threat to do­mes­tic jobs and firm pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity, and in­come growth. These sen­ti­ments have caused some coun­tries (e.g. Kenya, Nige­ria, South Africa, the United States and Zim­babwe) to im­ple­ment in­ward-look­ing or pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies with a view to pro­tect­ing do­mes­tic jobs and firms. On the other hand, cham­pi­ons of free trade, ar­gue that trade is a key driver to achieve eco­nomic growth, pros­per­ity and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment for all – in­clu­sive growth. A joint pub­li­ca­tion by the WTO, IMF and the World Bank (2017) pro­vides em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence of how trade has cre­ated jobs, growth and de­vel­op­ment in both de­vel­op­ing and de­vel­oped coun­tries, at the same time leav­ing out many in­di­vid­u­als and com­mu­ni­ties. The pub­li­ca­tion notes some down­side ef­fects brought by trade such as dis­lo­ca­tion of firms and work­ers. Be that as it may, the down­side ef­fects of trade should not be over­stated to un­der­mine the ben­e­fits of trade. Ac­cord­ing to the WTO, with ap­pro­pri­ate sup­port­ing poli­cies, the down­side ef­fects of trade can be off­set, thus lift­ing those left be­hind and en­abling them to reap fully the ben­e­fits of trade. Trade re­form and fa­cil­i­ta­tion poli­cies, global and re­gional in­te­gra­tion — plus rules-based trade gover­nance are some of the things that are needed to en­sure that trade ben­e­fits are in­clu­sive. It should also be em­pha­sised that pro­tec­tion­ist mea­sures are not the so­lu­tion to off­set the hu­man and eco­nomic down­side ef­fects of trade. Rather, em­pir­i­cal stud­ies demon­strate that, pro­tec­tion­ist mea­sures hurt those they are sup­posed to pro­tect. For ex­am­ple, the OECD study shows that pro­tec­tion­ism makes do­mes­tic firms less com­pet­i­tive in the ex­port mar­ket and stunts eco­nomic growth. Trade re­form and fa­cil­i­ta­tion poli­cies Trade poli­cies that are pro-poor — to the ex­tent they are con­sis­tent with the in­ter­na­tional trade rules — have the po­ten­tial to en­hance trade-led in­clu­sive growth. Pro-poor trade poli­cies en­tail poli­cies not only con­cerned with poverty al­le­vi­a­tion but also pro­vid­ing fairer and more ac­cess to ben­e­fits of eco­nomic open­ness, and pre­vent­ing the poor (in­clud­ing SMEs and women and young en­trepreneurs) from bear­ing the bur­den of trade lib­er­al­i­sa­tion. They also in­clude poli­cies that fa­cil­i­tate the adap­ta­tion and move­ment of work­ers (in­clud­ing women and youth) and SMEs to­wards sec­tors with grow­ing de­mand and the in­cor­po­ra­tion of new tech­nolo­gies with the ob­jec­tive of pro­mot­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity and em­ploy­ment growth of a wide group of work­ers and firms. Trade re­forms should also fo­cus on gen­der in­clu­sion. For in­stance, trade re­forms have been as­so­ci­ated with re­duced gen­der and racial wage gap in the US and Ger­many, and has also in­creased gen­der bal­ance (par­tic­u­larly women in­volve­ment) in the trade ac­tiv­i­ties in Le­sotho ap­parel and tex­tile in­dus­try. Trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion mea­sures are key to achieve in­clu­sive growth. The mea­sures sim­plify trade pro­ce­dures, re­duce trade costs, and en­hance ac­cess and ef­fi­ciency of trade-re­lated ser­vices (e.g. fi­nan­cial ser­vices and lo­gis­tics). The sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of pro­ce­dures ben­e­fits SMEs through cre­at­ing a level play­ing field for them and en­cour­ag­ing their par­tic­i­pa­tion in re­gional and global trade. Other trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion mea­sures such as ac­cess to fi­nance and trade-re­lated in­for­ma­tion ben­e­fit SMEs and may en­cour­age or en­able women and the youth to ac­tively par­tic­i­pate in trade. SMEs are very im­por­tant be­cause they ac­count for most jobs (even in Africa), and if they boost ex­port po­ten­tial, com­pet­i­tive­ness and con­nect to value chains, they gen­er­ally reg­is­ter par­tic­u­larly high pro­duc­tiv­ity, wage, and em­ploy­ment gains. Re­duc­tion in trade costs fa­cil­i­tates the ex­pan­sion of re­gional and global value chains, which are strong driv­ers of pro­duc­tiv­ity and man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­ports. They can also sup­port eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion de­pend­ing on the sup­ply-re­sponse, skills and ca­pa­bil­i­ties of the pri­vate sec­tor. How­ever, trade in Africa is met with high trans­ac­tion, trans­port, cus­toms and ad­min­is­tra­tive costs — plus de­lays at ports, bor­der posts and var­i­ous road­blocks as well as in­ef­fi­cient pay­ment systems. At this junc­ture, Africa’s trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion per­for­mance could be en­hanced quickly by im­ple­ment­ing the WTO Trade Fa­cil­i­ta­tion Agree­ment (al­beit with chal­lenges,) which is ex­pected to greatly re­duce trade costs and fa­cil­i­tate trade. To date only a few African coun­tries have rat­i­fied the Agree­ment. Mov­ing in to man­u­fac­tur­ing value chains is also crit­i­cal for in­clu­sive growth. Coun­tries (such as China, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Viet­nam and East­ern Europe) with greater in­volve­ment in man­u­fac­tur­ing value chains have re­alised a rapid in­crease in man­u­fac­tur­ing out­put and em­ploy­ment. How­ever, man­u­fac­tur­ing em­ploy­ment may be dif­fi­cult to achieve in coun­tries with un­skilled or less skilled work­ers and some job will be lost to tech­nol­ogy change, so skills ed­u­ca­tion and labour man­age­ment will be im­por­tant. In the EU, the US and Mex­ico, for ex­am­ple, smooth ad­just­ment and in­clu­sive growth was pro­moted via trade ad­just­ment pro­grammes. Ca­pac­ity build­ing is also key to en­sure that SMEs bol­ster their com­pet­i­tive­ness In­ter­na­tional and re­gional in­te­gra­tion Along with do­mes­tic poli­cies, in­ter­na­tional and re­gional in­te­gra­tion is also vi­tal in achiev­ing in­clu­sive growth. Thus, global and re­gional in­te­gra­tion can pro­mote in­clu­sive growth when work­ers and SMEs are able to ad­just to en­ter into grow­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties and adopt tech­nolo­gies availed through re­gional and in­ter­na­tional trade. In ad­di­tion, ac­tive trade (labour-mar­ket) poli­cies are also key to eas­ing work­ers’ mo­bil­ity across firms, in­dus­tries and re­gions – for in­stance, that ease move­ment of pro­fes­sion­als. Fur­ther­more, co­her­ence be­tween do­mes­tic, re­gional and in­ter­na­tional trade poli­cies is also im­por­tant for en­sur­ing that the ben­e­fits of trade are more evenly dis­trib­uted. Re­gional in­te­gra­tion can boost in­tra-re­gional trade, gen­er­ate higher scale of pro­duc­tion, and de­velop vi­brant value chains rel­e­vant to do­mes­tic firms (in­clud­ing SMEs). It would also pro­vide Africa the scale of economies that al­low it ben­e­fit fully from the grow­ing global value chains. Re­gional in­te­gra­tion can be sig­nif­i­cant for small ac­tors such as SMEs, women and young en­trepreneurs who are not able to op­er­ate fully at global level. Africa’s quest for re­gional in­te­gra­tion is be­com­ing salient with the an­tic­i­pated Tri­par­tite Free Trade Area (TFTA) and the Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (CFTA). In the face of these re­gional in­te­gra­tion ar­range­ments, it is there­fore im­por­tant for African lead­ers to con­sider ways in which these ar­range­ments can de­liver the frame­works needed for in­clu­sive growth in Africa. Talk­more Chid­ede is a re­searcher at the Trade Law cen­tre, is a ca­pac­ity-build­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion de­vel­op­ing trade-re­lated ca­pac­ity in East and South­ern Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20180420,King Mswati re­names Swazi­land to ‘ESwa­tini’,"THE king of Swazi­land, one of the world’s few ab­so­lute monar­chs, an­nounced yes­ter­day that his coun­try had changed its name to eSwa­tini to mark 50 years since in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tish rule. Mean­ing “place of the Swazi”, eSwa­tini is the Swazi lan­guage name for the tiny na­tion land­locked be­tween South Africa and Mozam­bique. Un­like some coun­tries, Swazi­land did not change its name when it gained in­de­pen­dence in 1968 af­ter be­ing a Bri­tish pro­tec­torate for more than 60 years. King Mswati III de­clared the name change dur­ing in­de­pen­dence day cel­e­bra­tions at a packed sports sta­dium in the sec­ond city of Manzini. “I would like to an­nounce that Swazi­land will now re­vert to its orig­i­nal name,” he said, wear­ing red mil­i­tary uni­form. “African coun­tries on get­ting in­de­pen­dence re­verted to their an­cient names be­fore they were colonised. So from now on the coun­try will be of­fi­cially be known as the King­dom of eSwa­tini.” The name Swazi­land angers some cit­i­zens as it is a mix of Swazi and English. The move has been mooted for sev­eral years, with law­mak­ers con­sid­er­ing the is­sue in 2015. Mswati III has used the new name in pre­vi­ous of­fi­cial speeches. The king, who was crowned in 1986 aged 18, rules by de­cree and has of­ten been crit­i­cised for his lav­ish life­style de­spite the grind­ing poverty suf­fered by many of his cit­i­zens. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties are banned from tak­ing part in elec­tions and only can­di­dates ap­proved by chiefs loyal to the king can stand for of­fice. The coun­try, which has a pop­u­la­tion of about 1.3 mil­lion peo­ple, suf­fers the high­est HIV rate in the world, with 27% of adults in­fected. The name change could mean that the coun­try’s con­sti­tu­tion is re-writ­ten, as well as changes for the Royal Swazi­land Po­lice Force, the Swazi­land De­fence Force and the Uni­ver­sity of Swazi­land. de­scribed her as “a re­mark­able woman” who brought to­gether “grit and grace, brains and beauty”. “She showed us what an hon­est, vi­brant, full life looks like.” Bar­bara met her hus­band-to-be at age 16 when she was a school­girl and he was a stu­dent at an elite Mas­sachusetts prepara­tory school. They mar­ried in 1945 while he was on leave from wartime ser­vice. She made his­tory as one of just two women to be wife and mother to two US pres­i­dents. Abi­gail Adams, who died in 1818, was the other. Her son Jeb, a two-term Florida gov­er­nor who also ran for pres­i­dent, hailed “the ex­cep­tion­ally gra­cious, gre­gar­i­ous, fun, funny, lov­ing, tough, smart, grace­ful woman who was the force of na­ture known as Bar­bara Bush”. Bar­bara Bush was her hus­band’s com­pan­ion and ad­vi­sor, trav­el­ling the world as he rose from Texas oil­man to con­gress­man, US am­bas­sador to China, di­rec­tor of the CIA and even­tu­ally to the vice pres­i­dency and the White House. But she avoided di­rect in­volve­ment in pol­i­tics, and the pos­tur­ing that comes with it – gain­ing a rep­u­ta­tion for tough­ness, wry hu­mour and straight-speak­ing. “I’m not run­ning for pres­i­dent; Ge­orge Bush is,” she said at the 1988 Re­pub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion. “What you see with me is what you get.” — Al Jazeera",津巴布韦

Rtd Col Dube said he was con­fi­dent of re­tain­ing the seat, which he won dur­ing par­lia­men­tary by-elec­tions held in 2015 fol­low­ing the re­call­ing of law­mak­ers linked to the Move­ment for Demo­cratic Change Re­newal Team by Mr Mor­gan Ts­van­gi­rai’s MDC-T. “I’m very con­fi­dent of win­ning this time around be­cause ev­ery­thing seems to be go­ing well, judg­ing from the re­sponse we are get­ting from our cam­paign. If one en­ters a race just like what an elec­tion is, they have to look at the cal­i­bre of the op­po­si­tion and suf­fice to say none of them has the qual­i­ties I have, but ob­vi­ous they are con­fi­dent in their own right,” he said. Rtd Col Dube said he was seek­ing a full term as Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment (MP) to en­able him to ful­fil his long time dream of en­sur­ing de­vel­op­ment in the constituency, which is home to one of the coun­try’s old­est town­ships, Makokoba. “Peo­ple have to ap­pre­ci­ate that I have only been an MP for three years and in those few years I have man­aged to do a lot in my Constituency, which turned around lives of mul­ti­tudes for the bet­ter. I’m call­ing on peo­ple to se­ri­ously scru­ti­nise the other can­di­dates whom I’m con­test­ing with and see if they are wor­thy. All I’m ask­ing for is to run a full term and ev­ery­one will see the de­vel­op­ments I will bring in the constituency,” he said. Rtd Col Dube has in the last two elec­tions lost the constituency’s seat to op­po­si­tion party can­di­dates. He is how­ever, one of the few politi­cians in the coun­try that has over the years been in­stru­men­tal in en­sur­ing pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment in his constituency through im­ple­ment­ing a num­ber of pro­jects as well as par­tic­i­pat­ing in char­ity work. “I have over the years spear­headed nu­mer­ous de­vel­op­men­tal pro­jects which have been quite ap­pre­ci­ated by the com­mu­nity and through this I have cre­ated a very close bond with the elec­torate. Though I have been ini­ti­at­ing a lot of pro­jects, I must say it took time for peo­ple to em­brace them and to ap­pre­ci­ate their im­pact on their liveli­hoods,” said Rtd Col Dube. He said Makokoba constituency was one of the few ur­ban con­stituen­cies in Bu­l­awayo and the coun­try as a whole whose ma­jor­ity of its pop­u­lace was liv­ing in ab­ject poverty. “Most of our peo­ple in the constituency live un­der squalid con­di­tions and are vul­ner­a­ble and there is re­ally a need to change their lives for the bet­ter.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20160916,Brazil after Dilma Roussef,"LAST week Tues­day for­mer Brazil­ian pres­i­dent Dilma Rouss­eff (pic­tured) left the pres­i­den­tial palace in Brasilia and boarded a plane for her adopted home city of Porto Ale­gre. She leaves be­hind a suc­ces­sor who risks in­dict­ment for far worse of­fences than the ones that brought her down and a coun­try that has lost its right to a place among the Brics. The Brics be­gan as a col­lec­tion of large, fast-grow­ing coun­tries in the poorer parts of the world that Jim O’Neill of Gold­man Sachs iden­ti­fied as emerg­ing global pow­ers in 2001: Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia and China. (South Africa and the cap­i­tal S were added in 2010.) The Brics even started hold­ing an­nual sum­mits, although they were rarely more than or­gies of self-con­grat­u­la­tion. No­body en­joyed their new sta­tus more than the Brazil­ians, but it was al­ways an il­lu­sion. China and In­dia, with 1,3 bil­lion peo­ple each, were in­dis­putably great pow­ers. Rus­sia was a re­cov­er­ing great power, not a new one. But Brazil, like South Africa, was an im­poster, lack­ing the crit­i­cal com­bi­na­tion of pop­u­la­tion, re­sources and in­dus­try that en­ti­tles a coun­try to a place in the first rank. Brazil was a fairly plau­si­ble im­poster dur­ing the years of the great boom in com­mod­ity prices, but for the past two years it has been in deep eco­nomic trouble. It was Rouss­eff’s mis­for­tune to win the 2014 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion just as the bot­tom dropped out of the coun­try’s eco­nomic “mir­a­cle”. Her pre­de­ces­sor Luiz Ina­cio “Lula” da Silva, ex­ploited the boom to build a mod­est wel­fare state that lifted 50 mil­lion Brazil­ians out of poverty. Rouss­eff strug­gled to main­tain those gains in the midst of Brazil’s worst re­ces­sion since the 1930s — the econ­omy shrank by al­most 4% last year — and be­came the least pop­u­lar pres­i­dent in Brazil­ian his­tory. Her un­pop­u­lar­ity, plus a huge cor­rup­tion scan­dal that im­pli­cated some mem­bers of her Work­ers’ Party (though not her­self per­son­ally), cre­ated the at­mos­phere in which it be­came pos­si­ble for the Brazil­ian Congress to im­peach her. She de­scribes it as a “con­sti­tu­tional coup” de­signed to re­move an elected left-wing govern­ment from power and she is quite right. Rouss­eff was not im­peached for cor­rup­tion. She was found guilty of win­dow­dress­ing govern­ment ac­counts be­fore the last elec­tion, in or­der to min­imise the im­pact of the col­lapse in Brazil’s ex­port earn­ings on her spend­ing prom­ises. It was a petty mis­de­meanour for which she re­ceived a grave pun­ish­ment at the hands of a Congress full of peo­ple who have com­mit­ted ac­tual crimes. It is uni­ver­sally ac­knowl­edged that the Brazil­ian Congress is one of the most cor­rupt leg­is­la­tures on the planet. Fifty-eight per­cent of the mem­bers are cur­rently un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for in­volve­ment in the “Lava Jato” (car wash) scan­dal, in which they al­legedly got kick­backs on con­tracts with the huge, state-owned Petro­bras oil mo­nop­oly. Few of these peo­ple are as­so­ci­ated with Rouss­eff, since the Work­ers Party holds less than one-tenth of the seats in Congress and de­pends on coali­tions for a ma­jor­ity. A cynic might say that that’s why Rouss­eff has sup­ported fed­eral prose­cu­tors who are in­ves­ti­gat­ing Lava Jato — but the same cynic would also have to ac­knowl­edge that one of the mo­tives for im­peach­ing Rouss­eff is to shut the in­ves­ti­ga­tion down. In­deed, the ma­jor­ity leader in the Se­nate, Romero Juca, was se­cretly recorded dis­cussing pre­cisely that goal — and he is a close po­lit­i­cal ally of Michel Te­mer, Rouss­eff’s for­mer vice-pres­i­dent (from an­other party), one of the lead­ers of the cam­paign against her and now her suc­ces­sor as pres­i­dent. Pres­i­dent Te­mer him­self has been accused of skim­ming US$300 000 off a nu­cle­aren­ergy con­tract, so it shouldn’t be too long be­fore some kind of amnesty is cob­bled to­gether for ev­ery­body who faces in­dict­ment in the Lava Jato case. Un­der Te­mer, a cen­tre-right politi­cian, it also shouldn’t be long be­fore aus­ter­ity mea­sures be­gin to cut into the in­creased spend­ing on ed­u­ca­tion and wel­fare that has trans­formed the lot of the Brazil­ian poor since the turn of the cen­tury. Money is scarcer now, of course, but there are other pos­si­ble ways of cop­ing with it than just im­pos­ing more sac­ri­fices on the poor. So what kind of Brazil emerges from this sorry story? It will be a much di­min­ished coun­try in wealth, in rep­u­ta­tion and in in­ter­na­tional in­flu­ence, and the so­cial and eco­nomic gulf be­tween the rich and the rest will widen once again. None of the Brics, apart from In­dia, is do­ing very well at the mo­ment: Rus­sia’s oil in­come has col­lapsed, China’s claims of con­tin­u­ing eco­nomic growth are deeply sus­pect and South Africa’s eco­nomic growth last year was 0,5%. As War­ren Buf­fet once said, it’s only when the tide goes out that you find out who has been swim­ming naked. Ev­ery­body, it turns out. What is espe­cially sad about Brazil is that it re­ally did use its boom to res­cue a gen­er­a­tion of the very poor from mis­ery and was start­ing to ad­dress the ex­treme cor­rup­tion of its po­lit­i­cal sys­tem as well. Now most of that will be rolled back. The crooks are back in charge.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200809,Farewell to four African heroes,"THIS is the week of Heroes in Africa and the Di­as­pora. It comes with the re­cent death of four men who made a dif­fer­ence. They fought for free­dom and stood large in their dif­fer­ent places. They all were vi­sion­ar­ies who were in­spired by an ear­lier gen­er­a­tion of men­tors. These men will be re­mem­bered for their hon­esty, dig­nity and de­ter­mi­na­tion. They span three gen­er­a­tions. All four were still ac­tive in mak­ing so­ci­eties a bet­ter place and all were role mod­els for their peers. All four passed on in the last days of July 2020. These heroes were quiet, prin­ci­pled peo­ple who spoke their mind and learned to speak bluntly in a quiet voice so peo­ple lis­tened. They fought for hu­man rights and democ­racy, for gen­der equal­ity and ad­vance­ment of women, and against racial seg­re­ga­tion and op­pres­sion. And all of these are role mod­els who should have a place of pride in our his­tory books. Per­rance Shiri A hero who was shaped by Julius Ny­erere’s Tan­za­nia and Samora Machel’s Mozam­bique. Per­rance Shiri, Air Chief Mar­shall (Rtd) and Zim­babwe’s Min­is­ter of Lands, Agri­cul­ture, Wa­ter and Ru­ral Re­set­tle­ment was a top com­man­der of the lib­er­a­tion war. He was a leader who served and worked hard to achieve the goals he had fought for. He trained at Mga­gao camp in Tan­za­nia and then trained oth­ers who be­came com­man­ders them­selves. He was a mem­ber of the mil­i­tary High Com­mand of the Zim­babwe African Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion Army (ZANLA) and com­man­der of the North-East op­er­a­tional area known as Tete Prov­ince. Cde Shiri, who died on July 29, was a free­dom fighter, Air Force com­man­der, min­is­ter, farmer and me­di­a­tor. He was in­volved in build­ing the new Air Force of Zim­babwe (AFZ). Hav­ing aban­doned his stud­ies to join the war of lib­er­a­tion, he used every op­por­tu­nity to study un­til he achieved two Masters De­grees while con­tin­u­ing to un­der­take na­tional du­ties. Cde Shiri fought for the lib­er­a­tion of his coun­try and won, as a re­spected guer­rilla com­man­der un­der Gen­eral Josiah Ton­gog­ara, in the fight for land and ed­u­ca­tion, in­still­ing the same lib­er­a­tion val­ues. His most re­cent achieve­ments of many were in land, wa­ter and food se­cu­rity. The last one was for­malised on the day that he passed, when an agree­ment was signed by the Gov­ern­ment with the white former com­mer­cial farm­ers for com­pen­sa­tion for land im­prove­ments, a mile­stone in re-en­gage­ment and bring­ing clo­sure to this as­pect of the land re­form. The Zim­babwe Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion War Vet­er­ans As­so­ci­a­tion said Cde Shiri was “an ex­cep­tional war strate­gist” who trained the young guer­rilla fight­ers who moved un­no­ticed into then Sal­is­bury and fired rock­ets into the oil stor­age tanks in the Souther­ton In­dus­trial Zone, caus­ing them to burn for sev­eral days, mark­ing a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone in the lib­er­a­tion war. Cde Shiri (65) was the youngest of these four heroes who died in the last days of July 2020. Ben­jamin Mkapa Ben­jamin Wil­liam Mkapa, third Pres­i­dent of the United Repub­lic of Tan­za­nia and stu­dent of Julius Ny­erere. When he died on July 23 at age 81, his peers eu­lo­gised him as a ded­i­cated builder of African unity, re­gional in­te­gra­tion and peacemaker. He of­ten quoted his men­tor in urg­ing the youth of Africa and the di­as­pora to take on im­pos­si­ble tasks and to run while oth­ers walk, say­ing, “It can be done, play your part.” His gen­er­a­tion did it, ded­i­cat­ing their lives to lib­er­a­tion and in­de­pen­dence. He was a young boy born in south­ern Tan­za­nia, who grew up in a colo­nial state. He left the coun­try and earned a de­gree in English Lit­er­a­ture be­fore re­turn­ing home to be­come a jour­nal­ist, am­bas­sador, Cab­i­net min­is­ter and Pres­i­dent. He be­lieved pas­sion­ately in African unity and in­te­gra­tion, eco­nomic devel­op­ment and peace. He showed us how it can be done. He was cho­sen by his party Chama Cha Mapin­duzi (CCM) to con­test the Pres­i­dency in 1995, which he won hand­ily and served two terms. His sup­port in­creased when he con­tested for the sec­ond term in 2000. He fo­cused mainly on re­or­gan­is­ing and lib­er­al­is­ing the econ­omy to func­tion more ef­fi­ciently. He was the first Pres­i­dent to work with a post-colo­nial and post-apartheid con­ti­nent of Africa. He de­scribed good lead­er­ship as “a leader who wants to serve, rather than be served”. The last line of Mkapa’s mem­oirs, pub­lished last year, states: “I will leave it to my God and you to de­cide what dif­fer­ence I have made in this world.” An­drew Mlan­geni A lit­tle fur­ther south, South Africans were bury­ing an­other hero who fought for free­dom and against apartheid. An­drew Mokete Mlan­geni, at age 95, was the last liv­ing mem­ber of the Rivo­nia tri­al­ists in­clud­ing Nel­son Man­dela and oth­ers, who ded­i­cated their youth to fight against apartheid and jus­tice. Mlan­geni is a hero for Africans and the world. He is a role model for hon­esty and com­mit­ment. He was born in the Free State and grew up in South West Town (Soweto), Johannesburg. He got his first job as a bus driver. Mlan­geni joined the African Na­tional Congress (ANC) start­ing with the Youth League. He was a branch del­e­gate to the fa­mous Congress of the Peo­ple that ap­proved the Free­dom Char­ter. He be­came a jour­nal­ist and was among the first ANC cadres to go for mil­i­tary train­ing in China. On his re­turn, fol­low­ing a po­lice raid on Lil­liesleaf Farm at Rivo­nia, Mlan­geni was charged with sab­o­tage and con­spir­acy at a time when most of the uMkhonto weSizwe High Com­mand were ar­rested. Eight of the Rivo­nia tri­al­ists were sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment and Mlan­geni spent 27 years on Robben Is­land. Soon af­ter his re­lease, he was elected Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment in the new South Africa where he served for 15 years be­fore re­tir­ing and con­tin­u­ing to ad­vo­cate for jus­tice and peace. He died in Tsh­wane on July 21. John Lewis The fourth free­dom fighter is John Robert Lewis, a serv­ing United States Con­gress­man born into poverty in the south­ern state of Alabama dur­ing the height of racial seg­re­ga­tion and op­pres­sion, who cam­paigned for civil rights with the Rev­erend Martin Luther King Jr. He was one of the young ac­tivists who tested the strict and vi­o­lent seg­re­ga­tion in the south by go­ing into re­stricted ar­eas, in­clud­ing buses, press­ing for vot­ing rights. At that time, vot­ing in the US was for whites only, a demo­cratic right won by black vot­ers in 1968. Leader of the march across the Ed­mund Pet­tus Bridge in Selma, Alabama to the State capi­tol Mont­gomery at the age of 25, Lewis was se­verely beaten by state troop­ers in a vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion known as Bloody Sun­day. Although still a youth, he helped to or­gan­ise the march on Washington, when Martin Luther King made his fa­mous speech, “I have a dream . . . that my four lit­tle chil­dren will one day live in a na­tion where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the con­tent of their char­ac­ter.” He was first elected to the US Congress in 1986 and was re-elected 16 times rep­re­sent­ing At­lanta, Ge­or­gia, and de­scribed as “At­lanta’s ser­vant leader”. Lewis died on July 17 at age 80 and was the first black law­maker to lie in state in the US Capi­tol Ro­tunda. The eu­logy at Ebenezer Bap­tist Church in At­lanta was de­liv­ered by former US Pres­i­dent Bar­rack Obama. In at­ten­dance were four former US Pres­i­dents. The web­site of the Na­tional Mu­seum of African Amer­i­can His­tory and Cul­ture said sim­ply, “Thank You, Rep. John Lewis”. So we will add: Thank You, Air Chief Mar­shall Per­rance Shiri. Thank You, An­drew Mlan­geni. Asante Sana, Ben­jamin W. Mkapa.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160420,Let’s build on the gains of in­de­pen­dence,"ON Mon­day, Zim­bab­weans from all walks of life con­verged at dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions around the country to cel­e­brate In­de­pen­dence Day. The 36th an­niver­sary of Uhuru came as the country is con­sol­i­dat­ing the gains of in­de­pen­dence through forg­ing ahead with poli­cies meant to eco­nom­i­cally em­power the pre­vi­ously marginalised ma­jor­ity black pop­u­la­tion. The suc­cess­ful im­ple­men­ta­tion of the land re­form pro­gramme has seen the emer­gence of a new crop of farm­ers to oc­cupy the space left by white com­mer­cial farm­ers. Zim­babwe’s new farm­ers are grow­ing mas­sive amounts of to­bacco and some of them are earn­ing more than they ever dreamed pos­si­ble. Zim­babwe is the largest pro­ducer of flue-cured to­bacco in Africa and oc­cu­pies fifth po­si­tion in the world be­hind the United States, Brazil, In­dia and China. In­dus­try spe­cial­ists es­ti­mate that pro­duc­tion has been in­creas­ing steadily since 2010 when farm­ers har­vested 58,5 mil­lion kilo­grammes of to­bacco. Zim­babwe pro­duced more than 220 mil­lion kgs of to­bacco be­fore the land re­form pro­gramme and the 2014 fig­ure of 216 mil­lion kgs shows that the country will soon sur­pass the amount of to­bacco which white com­mer­cial farm­ers used to pro­duce. Be­sides to­bacco, there have been re­mark­able suc­cesses recorded by maize, Soya bean and wheat farm­ers on farms for­merly owned by whites. The govern­ment has also been sup­port­ing new farm­ers by avail­ing equip­ment and in­puts. The In­di­geni­sa­tion and Eco­nomic Em­pow­er­ment Act has spawned a new breed of in­dus­tri­al­ists in ar­eas pre­vi­ously re­served for whites. The pro­gramme has also em­pow­ered com­mu­ni­ties through the Com­mu­nity Share Own­er­ship Trust(s) where com­pa­nies, mostly mines, are en­joined to con­trib­ute to a fund to ben­e­fit lo­cals in which they op­er­ate. Thirty-six years af­ter in­de­pen­dence, the lot of the gen­er­al­ity of Zim­bab­weans has im­proved tremen­dously un­der the cur­rent govern­ment de­spite the eco­nomic chal­lenges wrought by sanc­tions. The re­silience of the peo­ple of Zim­babwe has been re­mark­able in the face of naked ag­gres­sion by Bri­tain and its al­lies and we sa­lute the as­tute lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe who has steered the ship with aplomb since in­de­pen­dence in 1980. We also call on Zim­bab­weans to con­tinue sup­port­ing the govern­ment as it strives to eco­nom­i­cally em­power them. By im­ple­ment­ing pro-peo­ple poli­cies like the in­di­geni­sa­tion drive and land re­forms, the govern­ment is com­plet­ing a nat­u­ral process of de­coloni­sa­tion which be­gan with self-rule in 1980. We are glad that Zim­babwe’s poli­cies are find­ing res­o­nance in the re­gion and con­ti­nent with Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s chair­man­ship of both the African Union and Sadc en­sur­ing that value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion cen­tral planks of the country’s eco­nomic blue­print Zim-As­set cascade to the two blocs. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties like the Eco­nomic Free­dom Fight­ers in South Africa also share Zim­babwe’s dream of eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment of the ma­jor­ity black pop­u­la­tion and in its in­de­pen­dence con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage, the EFF said the country re­mained an in­spi­ra­tion to the South African lib­er­a­tion strug­gle. “The EFF is in­spired by the Zim­bab­weans and their his­tor­i­cal les­son shall in­form how we en­gage in our own strug­gle to re­turn the land to its right­ful own­ers for the to­tal eman­ci­pa­tion of our peo­ple‚” the party’s spokesper­son, Mbuyiseni Nd­lozi, said. He said‚ de­spite “all its weak­nesses‚ Zim­babwe stood the test of time re­gard­less of be­ing iso­lated by world big forces (through sanc­tions) for its in­sis­tence on re­turn­ing the land to its na­tive pop­u­la­tions”. “To­day‚ many Zim­bab­wean black fam­i­lies own and work their lands‚ some­thing many in the con­ti­nent do not share. Zim­babwe re­mains an in­spi­ra­tion to the South African lib­er­a­tion strug­gle in par­tic­u­lar the les­son that with­out the land‚ de­coloni­sa­tion is in­com­plete and a so­cial time bomb.” We are happy that the dream of the pi­o­neers of the African lib­er­a­tion move­ment lives on through par­ties such as the EFF and ANC of South Africa. We also urge Zim­bab­weans to rally be­hind their govern­ment and ex­er­cise pa­tience as it works to­wards grow­ing the econ­omy. In his In­de­pen­dence Day speech, Cde Mu­gabe im­plored Zim­bab­weans to work for the good of the country and cher­ish their free­dom which did not come on a sil­ver plat­ter. He said the govern­ment was com­mit­ted to im­prov­ing the wel­fare of civil ser­vants by match­ing their salaries to the Poverty Da­tum Line. “Govern­ment will also con­tinue to find ways of im­prov­ing the wel­fare of civil ser­vants,” he said. “It is the de­sire of Govern­ment that salaries pro­gres­sively match the Poverty Da­tum Line. Govern­ment apol­o­gises for the late dis­burse­ment of salaries, bonuses and monthly pay­ments to pen­sion­ers but, be rest as­sured that Govern­ment is work­ing flat out to im­prove the sit­u­a­tion. Now that the work­ers have be­gun con­tribut­ing to­wards the pen­sion fund, pay­ment of pen­sion­ers will be more pre­dictable and on time.” We agree with the Pres­i­dent and call on Zim­bab­weans to jeal­ously safe­guard the legacy of the strug­gle by sup­port­ing govern­ment ini­tia­tives to im­prove their lives.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20210122,Zam­bezi project: Only per­ma­nent so­lu­tion to Bu­l­awayo wa­ter woes,"MORE than a cen­tury ago in 1912, peo­ple of Mata­bele­land were promised that they will draw wa­ter from the Zam­bezi River, through the Mata­bele­land Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project (MZWP). Ev­ery year, they have been hop­ing that this mas­sive project, which will draw wa­ter from Gwayi-Shangani Dam will ma­te­ri­alise. But it has proved to be just a hoax as Mata­bele­land and Bu­l­awayo con­tinue to suf­fer peren­nial wa­ter short­ages. The project was mooted more than a hun­dred years ago dur­ing the colo­nial era. It was later to be adopted by the Zanu gov­ern­ment af­ter in­de­pen­dence in 1980. De­spite the hope that this wa­ter project was go­ing to be the panacea to the Mata­bele­land and Bu­l­awayo peren­nial wa­ter prob­lems, the wa­ter sit­u­a­tion in the re­gion has fur­ther wors­ened and is ex­ac­er­bated by an in­crease in pop­u­la­tion in the re­gion. Bu­l­awayo Wa­ter Ac­tion group sec­re­tary Khum­bu­lani Maphosa, who is also the co-or­di­na­tor for the Mata­bele­land In­sti­tute for Hu­man Rights, blamed the fail­ure to com­plete the wa­ter project on what he termed as “hy­dro-pol­i­tics”. Maphosa said in 1912, the to­tal cost of the project was es­ti­mated at 60 000 pounds only. It was ex­pen­sive then. “Twenty years later, then Rhode­sian Prime Min­is­ter Godfrey Hug­gins said the coun­try couldn’t af­ford the 60 000 pounds needed for the project. “Sim­i­lar cost jus­ti­fi­ca­tion was given in the 1950s by Prime Min­is­ter Edgar White­head when 60 000 pounds was then pro­posed cost for the project,” Maphosa said. “Fast track it to now, we are told of progress be­ing stalled due to lack of fund­ing, or that the con­trac­tor has downed tools due to lack of fund­ing,” he said. Maphosa opines that the is­sue of fund­ing is now be­ing used as a scape­goat for fail­ure to im­ple­ment the project. He said there was no ex­cuse for fail­ing to im­ple­ment the MZWP be­cause gov­ern­ment had en­sured that sim­i­lar wa­ter projects like Tugwi-Mukosi were fully im­ple­mented and well-funded. Maphosa said gov­ern­ment was also show­ing se­ri­ous­ness in fund­ing the con­struc­tion of the new Par­lia­ment Building at a cost of US$140 mil­lion, which means that the is­sue is about pri­or­i­ties and the MZWP is not among top pri­or­ity projects. In his 2021 Na­tional Bud­get state­ment, Fi­nance min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube al­lo­cated $4,5 bil­lion to­wards the Gwayi-Shangani Dam for its com­ple­tion. But Maphosa said the money would be af­fected by in­fla­tion, as well as Trea­sury’s fail­ure to dis­burse the financial al­lo­ca­tions on time, and lack of trans­parency in terms of dis­clo­sure of the fi­nal cost of the project. He said the wa­ter short­ages in Mata­bele­land and Bu­l­awayo were now a hu­man rights is­sue. “The gov­ern­ment needs to be held ac­count­able both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally be­cause the re­al­i­sa­tion and ful­fil­ment of the right to wa­ter (for potable and de­vel­op­ment use) is not only guar­an­teed in the Con­sti­tu­tion of Zim­babwe but also in in­ter­na­tional laws which Zim­babwe is sig­na­tory to. Bu­l­awayo and Mata­bele­land (like the rest of Zim­babwe) have a wa­ter cri­sis be­cause a se­ri­ous lead­er­ship cri­sis is man­i­fest­ing it­self in wa­ter short­ages.” The hu­man rights de­fender also de­cried the fact that peo­ple are made to pay for wa­ter from es­ti­mated bills, which he de­scribed as “rob­bing cit­i­zens of their hard­earned money”. He said there was no rea­son why gov­ern­ment should fail to en­sure the com­ple­tion of MZWP be­cause one of Zim­babwe’s neigh­bours — Botswana com­pleted a 450-kilo­me­tre Zam­bezi wa­ter pipeline four years ago, and was in the process of com­plet­ing an­other 100-kilo­me­tre pipeline. “Namibia, Egypt and Botswana are all lo­cated in desert ar­eas but they are able to pro­vide their cit­i­zens with wa­ter. That is a sign of good lead­er­ship. Ours is a lead­er­ship cri­sis be­cause the Vic­to­ria Falls is on the Zam­bezi River, but the coun­try suf­fers from wa­ter prob­lems. It is a lead­er­ship prob­lem,” he said. Maphosa said the Zim­babwe Na­tional Wa­ter Au­thor­ity (Zinwa) should be dis­banded as it was a failed en­tity which was wast­ing the coun­try’s re­sources. “We also need to build the ca­pac­ity of res­i­dents to force their elected of­fi­cials to hold the ex­ec­u­tive to ac­count over wa­ter is­sues. As long as res­i­dents are not hold­ing the gov­ern­ment ac­count­able, there won’t be any progress. Right now we are told that $4,5 bil­lion has been al­lo­cated for Gwayi-Shangani dam. “We need our coun­cil­lors and MPs to es­tab­lish whether it is enough, how much will be dis­bursed and when, as well as the project com­ple­tion time­lines.” He said civil so­ci­ety, elected rep­re­sen­ta­tives and cit­i­zens were to blame for fail­ing to de­mand wa­ter rights. “Civic so­ci­ety and the me­dia as the fourth es­tate have failed to hold politi­cians and gov­ern­ment ac­count­able. As part of agenda set­ting, they need to gal­vanise the res­i­dents to non-vi­o­lently de­mand that this project be pri­ori­tised and com­pleted,” he said, adding that the Mata­bele­land Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project was a na­tional pri­or­ity. Na­tional Con­sumer Rights As­so­ci­a­tion (Na­cora) ad­vi­sor Effie Ncube said the only rea­son why the MZWP had not been im­ple­mented was to en­sure the Mata­bele­land re­gion re­mained marginalised. “They know that without wa­ter Mata­bele­land will for­ever re­main poor and they want it that way. Re­mem­ber wa­ter is not only es­sen­tial for the dayto-day lives of the peo­ple but it is also a key driver of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. “There is no mean­ing­ful eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity that can take place without ad­e­quate wa­ter sup­ply. Very lit­tle re­sources have been chan­nelled to­wards the start and com­ple­tion of the project. It is all talk, yet there is no bud­getary ac­tion. “The lit­tle that has been di­rected to the project is only enough for a few bore­holes, not a project of the size and com­plex­ity that the Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project is,” Ncube said. He said the wa­ter prob­lems in Mata­bele­land and Bu­l­awayo would re­sult in food in­se­cu­rity, lack of jobs and poverty, and dis­eases such as cholera and dysen­tery. Ncube said deal­ing with pan­demics like COVID-19 would be im­pos­si­ble without wa­ter. “Zanu PF doesn’t care and will never care. There­fore, if peo­ple want to see the Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project com­ing to fruition they must vote Zanu PF out of power,” he said. Ncube said the wa­ter pipes were also too old, and needed re­fur­bish­ment, adding that this re­quires po­lit­i­cal will. “We need to put aside tens or hun­dreds of mil­lions of US dol­lars ev­ery financial year, and to en­sure we have the right peo­ple win­ning the ten­ders, not the usual po­lit­i­cal crooks that are milk­ing the coun­try dry.” The con­sumer rights ac­tivist said at its com­ple­tion, the Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project should have canals and pipe­lines con­nect­ing Binga and even Beit­bridge. Mata­bele­land North Pro­vin­cial Af­fairs min­is­ter Richard Moyo, who is also the Zanu PF pro­vin­cial chair­man, dis­missed the claims that gov­ern­ment was to blame for the project de­lays. He claimed that Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s new dis­pen­sa­tion con­structed the Gway­iShangani Dam to 40% com­ple­tion a few years af­ter com­ing into power. “Re­mem­ber that the Zam­bezi Wa­ter Project was started over one hun­dred years ago, but also take note that the first brick of the project was laid by the new dis­pen­sa­tion. Maybe the old dis­pen­sa­tion can be blamed for the de­lay. We ex­pect the project to be com­plete by end of this year,” Moyo said. He said the project had been stalled by the COVID-19 lock­down reg­u­la­tions which forced the con­trac­tor to cease op­er­a­tions and go back to China. “If not for the lock­down, they would have com­pleted it by now.” Moyo said gov­ern­ment re­leased US$58 mil­lion, $200 mil­lion and $600 mil­lion to­wards the con­struc­tion of the project, bring­ing the whole fund­ing to $800 mil­lion and US$58 mil­lion. But Mata­bele­land Zam­bezi Wa­ter Trust (MZWT) chair­man Richard Ndlovu said the de­lays in the com­ple­tion of the project were due to short­age of funds. The po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship has re­alised the im­por­tance of the project to the re­gion and the coun­try at large in terms of the econ­omy,” Moyo said. “The de­lays might have been due to pol­i­tics in the past, but now it’s be­yond that. The new dis­pen­sa­tion is com­mit­ted to com­plete the project. Mnan­gagwa is a lis­ten­ing pres­i­dent. In two years time I see this project be­ing com­pleted,” Moyo said.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171006,Trade can help poor coun­tries cope with wa­ter,"MANY peo­ple be­lieve that wa­ter short­ages will threaten global food se­cu­rity. That is not true. The world is not short of wa­ter. Even with cli­mate change, there will be enough to grow all the food needed by the 10 bil­lion peo­ple ex­pected to pop­u­late the earth by 2050. Or even the 11 bil­lion ex­pected by the end of the 21st cen­tury. But global food se­cu­rity will re­main a mas­sive chal­lenge, and wa­ter pro­vides us with a use­ful lens through which to view the prob­lem. An anal­y­sis of the wa­ter chal­lenges sug­gests that the real ob­sta­cles to greater food se­cu­rity are the un­even dis­tri­bu­tion of land, peo­ple, pro­duc­tive cap­i­tal – and wa­ter. Bridg­ing the gaps that arise be­cause of this un­even dis­tri­bu­tion will re­main the pri­mary chal­lenge. And trade poli­cies must help, not hin­der this process. Why this con­clu­sion? In a re­cent re­port “Wa­ter and Trade”, we sought to un­der­stand how wa­ter con­trib­utes to, and is af­fected by, trade rules and prac­tices. Specif­i­cally, we asked whether trade pol­icy could help to re­solve lo­cal wa­ter prob­lems. Wa­ter is a very bulky low value com­mod­ity which can­not be eas­ily dis­trib­uted. So lo­cal dif­fer­ences in wa­ter avail­abil­ity high­light the larger dis­tri­bu­tional chal­lenges. We did not think that pro­pos­als to re­strict trade in goods from wa­ter-scarce coun­tries would be ef­fec­tive or fair. En­vi­ron­men­tal ad­vo­cates have sug­gested that coun­tries should meet ex­ter­nally im­posed wa­ter ef­fi­ciency stan­dards if they want to ex­port their pro­duce. The most ex­treme pro­posal is to reg­u­late the amount of wa­ter that a coun­try can use to pro­duce goods and ser­vices, so-called “vir­tual wa­ter”, and en­force such lim­its through trade reg­u­la­tions. We sug­gest that at­tempts to solve wa­ter prob­lems through such trade pro­cesses would be un­help­ful and un­work­able. Cities tak­ing up more wa­ter So what should be done? While there is no global wa­ter short­age, there are many lo­cal chal­lenges. Many places will have to limit their use of wa­ter for food pro­duc­tion so that they can sup­ply the needs of cities and in­dus­tries and pro­tect the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment. China is the most ob­vi­ous ex­am­ple. Its eco­nomic growth has been ac­com­pa­nied by mas­sive mi­gra­tion from coun­try­side to cities and ur­ban wa­ter de­mand for do­mes­tic and eco­nomic uses is soar­ing. Greater pros­per­ity also drives de­mand for more and dif­fer­ent food­stuffs, which in turn need more wa­ter. A choice has to be made be­tween peo­ple in cities, farm­ers and the en­vi­ron­ment. Many other coun­tries face sim­i­lar chal­lenges, al­beit at a smaller scale. Mod­el­ling work has shown that food pro­duc­tion in the dry north of China will fall as wa­ter is di­verted to cities and in­dus­tries. Peo­ple will lose their liveli­hoods. Given its still rapidly grow­ing econ­omy, and low pop­u­la­tion growth, China will be able to of­fer them al­ter­na­tives. This is not so easy in other coun­tries with less di­verse and dy­namic economies. If wa­ter short­ages mean that food can­not be pro­duced lo­cally and there are no al­ter­na­tive sources of in­come, the log­i­cal re­sponse is for peo­ple to mi­grate else­where. It has al­ready been sug­gested that cur­rent waves of mi­gra­tion from the Mid­dle East, Syria in par­tic­u­lar, were driven by con­flict that was orig­i­nally trig­gered by a long drought. Deal­ing with short­falls Trade could help to solve this prob­lem. Glob­ally there is enough un­der-used land and wa­ter to pro­duce more than enough food to meet the world’s needs. For a start, farm­ers in places like Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the US would be happy to pro­duce and sell far more food than they do to­day. So the food needs of places with wa­ter (or land) stress could be met through trade. This ap­proach is at­trac­tive for coun­tries that want to pro­tect and ex­pand their cur­rent agri­cul­tural mar­kets. But it does not ad­dress the over-arch­ing chal­lenge which is to en­sure that peo­ple in poorer coun­tries can earn enough to af­ford the food (and other things) that they need. How will farm­ers who have to give up their wa­ter to the cities make a liv­ing? What will hap­pen in coun­tries that need to im­port food but where many peo­ple are too poor to buy it? And crit­i­cally, will coun­tries trust the world’s trade sys­tem to pro­vide re­li­able sup­plies in times of po­lit­i­cal stress and cli­matic un­pre­dictabil­ity? We con­cluded that trade has helped main­tain food se­cu­rity in coun­tries where wa­ter avail­abil­ity lim­its do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion. This is ex­actly how the oil-rich coun­tries of the Mid­dle East have man­aged to over­come their nat­u­ral re­source con­straints. Closer to home, the ex­pe­ri­ence of South Africa and other South­ern African Devel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (SADC) coun­tries is that we im­port grains when drought cuts lo­cal pro­duc­tion. This shows that trade and in­vest­ment in agri­cul­ture can help coun­tries buf­fer the im­pact of cli­mate vari­abil­ity and shocks, such as floods and droughts. It can also pro­vide an im­por­tant mech­a­nism to off­set cli­mate change-in­duced pro­duc­tion de­creases and im­prove ac­cess to food. But in some cases trade will make only a lim­ited con­tri­bu­tion to ad­dress­ing wa­ter short­ages. Coun­tries with very large pop­u­la­tions such as In­dia and China will be con­cerned about the abil­ity of global food trade to sup­ply the huge quan­ti­ties needed by their mas­sive pop­u­la­tions. For poorer coun­tries, in­clud­ing many in Africa, our other con­clu­sion is that trade poli­cies should help and not hin­der peo­ple to im­prove their liveli­hoods from agri­cul­ture. Trade pol­icy should en­cour­age agri­cul­tural sup­port mech­a­nisms that help to achieve ef­fi­cient and sus­tain­able wa­ter use and of­fer liveli­hoods to poor peo­ple. Too of­ten, they do the op­po­site. For ex­am­ple, sub­si­dies to help In­dian farm­ers im­prove their ir­ri­ga­tion ef­fi­ciency are tech­ni­cally il­le­gal in terms of WTO rules. Trade pol­icy should also sup­port the long-term ef­forts by African govern­ments to at­tract in­vest­ment aimed at in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity of do­mes­tic agri­cul­ture, in­clud­ing greater wa­ter use ef­fi­cien­cies. For­eign in­vest­ment in African agri­cul­ture is some­times char­ac­terised as “land grab­bing”, prompt­ing con­cerns that it will place ad­di­tional stress on lo­cal wa­ter re­sources. But in many cases, ex­ter­nal in­vest­ment can en­able un­der-utilised re­sources to be pro­duc­tively mo­bilised. This kind of in­vest­ment has helped Kenya and Ethiopia be­come ma­jor ex­porters of cut flow­ers and fresh veg­eta­bles, re­duc­ing ru­ral poverty.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190811,Glob­al­i­sa­tion will not sur­vive Trump,"ZIM­BABWE’S Vi­sion 2030 can­not be achieved if women are not given equal op­por­tu­nity to par­tic­i­pate fully in all spheres of so­ci­ety on the ba­sis of equal­ity with men. This in­cludes par­tic­i­pa­tion in cor­po­rate boards, which is the fo­cus of this ar­ti­cle. The Con­sti­tu­tion — the supreme law in the land — un­der Ar­ti­cle 17, man­dates the State to pro­mote full gen­der bal­ance in Zim­babwe, in­clud­ing full par­tic­i­pa­tion of women in all spheres of so­ci­ety on the ba­sis of equal­ity with men. How­ever, the Con­sti­tu­tion does not stop there: it also man­dates the State to take all rea­son­able mea­sures, in­clud­ing leg­isla­tive mea­sures, to en­sure that both gen­ders are equally rep­re­sented in all in­sti­tu­tions and agen­cies of Govern­ment, at ev­ery level. The Con­sti­tu­tion made a dec­la­ra­tion — there shall be equal rep­re­sen­ta­tion be­tween men and women in all spheres of so­ci­ety; the is­sue is set­tled, it is not con­testable — pe­riod! In view of this, what we can de­bate on is this: does in­clu­sion of women on boards im­prove per­for­mance or it is a ne­ces­sity to achieve so­cial co­he­sion in so­ci­ety? Cor­po­rate Boards In the cor­po­rate board­room, gen­der di­ver­sity is about lev­el­ling the field of play and cre­at­ing equal rep­re­sen­ta­tion be­tween men and women. It is about hav­ing bal­anced boards — 50-50 par­ity — in terms of gen­der com­po­si­tion. Cor­po­rate boards glob­ally are pre­dom­i­nantly male dom­i­nated, with women tak­ing mi­nor­ity seats on boards. From an evo­lu­tion­ary per­spec­tive, all male boards are fast dis­ap­pear­ing across the globe. The UK June 2018 Cran­field FTSE Fe­male Re­port shows that all-male boards have now dis­ap­peared from the top FTSE 100 com­pa­nies by rev­enue. AS was the case in the 1930s, the seem­ingly in­ex­orable drift to­wards pro­tec­tion­ism is part of a deeper cri­sis of the in­ter­na­tional sta­tus quo. When Bei­jing this week (last week) ac­cused the US of “de­lib­er­ately de­stroy­ing the in­ter­na­tional or­der”, it was re­ally say­ing that US hege­mony will no longer go un­chal­lenged. Glob­al­i­sa­tion as we have known it is com­ing to an end and that is by no means un­wel­come. Hailed as the ul­ti­mate in hu­man progress, a model based on loos­en­ing the con­trols on cap­i­tal and the con­struc­tion of global sup­ply chains has spawned re­cur­rent fi­nan­cial crises, fos­tered cor­ro­sive in­equal­ity and wors­ened the cli­mate emer­gency. True, mil­lions of peo­ple have been lifted out of poverty in the past 25 years, but The link be­tween hav­ing more women on boards and com­pany per­for­mance has been opened for de­bate and is prov­ing to be highly con­testable. In other words, there is no sci­en­tif­i­cally proven pos­i­tive cor­re­la­tion be­tween the two. most of them live in a coun­try — China — that has kept the mar­ket at arm’s-length. The world’s stock mar­kets see things dif­fer­ently. They trem­ble ev­ery time Don­ald Trump tweets a paean to pro­tec­tion­ism. Like­wise, multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions fret about the pos­si­ble dam­age that trade bar­ri­ers might cause to global sup­ply chains. It is clear that those who have done best out of glob­al­i­sa­tion tend to be the rich and pow­er­ful, and they are not go­ing to give up their priv­i­leges with­out a fight. Noth­ing in this is new. Through­out his­tory there have been suc­ces­sive waves of glob­al­i­sa­tion fol­lowed by a back­lash when the model over-reached it­self. This is one of those oc­ca­sions and all the in­gre­di­ents are in place for a strug­gle be­tween the de­fend­ers of the sta­tus quo and those who say that re­cent trends in pol­i­tics, tech­nol­ogy and the cli­mate point to the need for a new world or­der fo­cused more on lo­cal so­lu­tions, stronger na­tion states and a re­formed in­ter­na­tional sys­tem. It is quite a stretch to imag­ine that Trump has this in mind when he is bash­ing China, but the eco­nomic cri­sis of the 1930s — of which pro­tec­tion­ism was one part — led even­tu­ally, al­beit af­ter the war, to re­forms that made the world a sounder and safer place. The chal­lenge is to make sure cri­sis again leads to change, and that process starts with an hon­est ap­praisal of the mess we are in. For more than a decade, ever since the fi­nan­cial crash of 2008, there has been a fran­tic at­tempt to put glob­al­i­sa­tion back on its feet and re­turn to the sta­tus quo ante. Trump is proof that those at­tempts have ended in fail­ure. In ret­ro­spect, the early 1990s marked glob­al­i­sa­tion’s high point. Some women in the US have voiced anger to what they view as a “tick-box” ap­proach to gen­der di­ver­sity on com­pany boards. In a Boards Re­search ar­ti­cle en­ti­tled “When and Why Di­ver­sity Im­proves Your Board’s Per­for­mance” by S.J. Creary, M.H. The Soviet Union had col­lapsed, for­mer com­mu­nist coun­tries were be­com­ing mar­ket economies, in­de­pen­dent cen­tral banks were all the rage and a mul­ti­lat­eral trade deal was con­cluded af­ter more than seven years of ne­go­ti­a­tions. Europe’s in­te­gra­tionist pro­ject was in full swing, with prepa­ra­tions un­der way for a sin­gle cur­rency. Pol­i­tics dur­ing the 1990s was dom­i­nated by par­ties of the cen­tre right and cen­tre left, pur­su­ing broadly sim­i­lar eco­nomic poli­cies: bud­getary dis­ci­pline, lib­er­al­is­ing cap­i­tal flows, en­cour­ag­ing the in­cur­sion of the mar­ket into sec­tors hith­erto off lim­its. Whether in the de­vel­oped coun­tries of Europe or the emerg­ing mar­kets of Latin Amer­ica, or­tho­doxy reined supreme. Sure, it was ac­cepted that there were teething prob­lems with the new world or­der, but the cold war was over and Rus­sia no longer a threat. Amer­ica would use its un­chal­lenged mil­i­tary might to po­lice the world and keep fac­to­ries boom­ing in­ter­na­tion­ally through its will­ing­ness to act as the con­sumer of last re­sort. Lit­tle of this utopian vi­sion has sur­vived. There has not been a com­pleted set of mul­ti­lat­eral trade talks since the Uruguay round was wrapped up in late 1993, in large part be­cause this was the last time the US and the EU were able to carve out a deal to their mu­tual in­ter­est and then im­pose it on the rest of the world. The G7 — the US, Canada, Japan and the four big­gest economies of Europe — no longer call all the shots at in­ter­na­tional sum­mits. The in­de­pen­dence of cen­tral banks is threat­ened. The US is un­will­ing to soak up all the world’s ex­cess pro­duc­tion and in­stead de­mands that coun­tries such as Ger­many run down their trade sur­pluses. Europe’s drive for in­te­gra­tion has stalled. Par­ties of the cen­tre have been hol­lowed out, ei­ther be­cause they failed to spot the weak­nesses in­her­ent in glob­al­i­sa­tion or were too timid to act if they did. The Wash­ing­ton con­sen­sus — that there was a one-size-fits-all so­lu­tion to the prob­lems of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that in­volved pri­vati­sa­tion, aban­don­ing cap­i­tal con­trols and bud­getary rec­ti­tude — has fallen into dis­re­pute. And Rus­sia is not the busted flush it was sup­posed to be. The risk that the cur­rent it­er­a­tion of glob­al­i­sa­tion could end in mil­i­tary con­flict is much higher than gen­er­ally ac­knowl­edged. To pre­vent such an out­come, there needs to be change at all lev­els, start­ing with the lo­cal one. Even dur­ing its hey­day, large chunks of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity re­mained un­touched by glob­al­i­sa­tion and that seg­ment is likely to grow as economies be­come more ser­vice-sec­tor dom­i­nated. In ad­di­tion, coun­tries such as the US are al­ready bring­ing pro­duc­tion back within its bor­ders — in part be­cause of the high cost of trans­port­ing goods around the world, and in part be­cause tech­no­log­i­cal change — greater use of ro­bots and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence — has re­duced the fi­nan­cial in­cen­tive to off­shore. There is also go­ing to be an en­hanced role for the na­tion state, the death of which has been ex­ag­ger­ated. It will no longer be good enough for politi­cians to fob off vot­ers with the idea that glob­al­i­sa­tion is an un­stop­pable force of na­ture against which they are pow­er­less. Telling the pub­lic that in­equal­ity, in­dus­trial de­cay and stag­nant liv­ing stan­dards are some­thing they have to suck up is ask­ing for big pop­ulist trou­ble. China’s Belt and Road ini­tia­tive is an ex­am­ple of how coun­tries are start­ing to op­er­ate at a sub-global level. Bei­jing’s net­work of in­fra­struc­ture projects across Asia and Europe has a dual pur­pose: to pro­vide a mar­ket for Chi­nese goods and to ex­tend Bei­jing’s reach in parts of the world where Amer­ica’s hard and soft power is weak. Sim­i­larly, trade deals are likely to be ne­go­ti­ated bi­lat­er­ally or among coali­tions of the will­ing. Fi­nally, there’s a need for re­form at a global level: to mo­bilise ef­fec­tive cli­mate-change ac­tion, to meet the United Na­tions’ sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals, to rein in the power of global fi­nance through curbs on cap­i­tal flows, and to piece to­gether a sys­tem of rules-based, but man­aged, trade. None of this will be easy — in fact, it will be hellishly dif­fi­cult. But three de­vel­op­ments pro­vide cause for op­ti­mism. The first is that the fail­ings of the cur­rent sys­tem have be­come too big to ig­nore. The sec­ond is that fail­ure has, as ever, led to new think­ing. The third is that the new ideas are start­ing to in­flu­ence pol­icy.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160524,17 girls die as fire rips through Thai school,"AT least 17 young girls died af­ter a fire swept through the dor­mi­tory of a school for chil­dren of hill tribes in north­ern Thai­land, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day, adding sev­eral oth­ers were ei­ther miss­ing or in­jured. The fire started late at night, mean­ing many of the chil­dren were asleep and un­able to es­cape as flames en­gulfed the two-storey build­ing. “The fire broke out at 11PM on Sun­day (1600 GMT). Seven­teen girls were killed and two are still miss­ing, with five in­jured,” Colonel Prayad Singsin of the po­lice in Chi­ang Rai told the AFP news agency. Two of the in­jured are in a se­ri­ous con­di­tion, he said. “The fire is out, but the cause of the blaze is still un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” Prayad said, adding that forensic of­fi­cers were due to ar­rive yes­ter­day. A Chi­ang Rai pro­vin­cial of­fi­cial con­firmed the death toll, adding that the pri­vately run school was home to girls aged be­tween six and 13, drawn mainly from the de­prived lo­cal hill tribes. “There were 38 stu­dents in­side the dor­mi­tory when the fire broke out. Some weren’t yet asleep so they es­caped,” the prov­ince’s deputy gover­nor, Arkom Suka­pan, told AFP. “But oth­ers were asleep and couldn’t es­cape, re­sult­ing in the large num­ber of ca­su­al­ties.” Pho­to­graphs on the school’s Face­book page showed fire­fight­ers strug­gling to douse the flames as they tore through the wooden build­ing. Thai me­dia showed a fire en­gine spray­ing wa­ter on to the blaze as the up­per storey of the school was con­sumed by the fire. Res­cue work­ers picked through the de­bris late on Sun­day and into yes­ter­day morn­ing. Thai­land is home to a patch­work of hill tribes who mainly live in the re­mote north­ern area bor­der­ing Laos and Myan­mar. Many are de­scen­dants of refugees from Myan­mar or China and live in sub­sis­tence farm­ing com­mu­ni­ties that are be­yond the reach of state re­sources. Hill tribe chil­dren suf­fer at school, as well as in health and de­vel­op­ment. Poverty means adults are easy prey for drug gangs who pay them to smug­gle nar­cotics - in­clud­ing heroin and am­phet­a­mines - across a zone known as the Golden Tri­an­gle. Thai se­cu­rity forces fre­quently en­gage in deadly gun bat­tles with hill tribe drug mules in the re­gion. That link en­gen­ders prej­u­dice among many Thais, and hill tribes are of­ten por­trayed neg­a­tively in the me­dia. Chi­ang Rai town and the sur­round­ing hills are pop­u­lar with for­eign tourists for hik­ing and ad­ven­ture sports. Tourists can go on tours to the visit the iso­lated tribes, al­though the prac­tice of pos­ing for pho­to­graphs at vil­lages has come in for crit­i­cism for de­grad­ing their unique cul­ture and treat­ing the eth­nic groups ex­hibits in “hu­man zoos”.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180921,Can a ban on sec­ond-hand im­ports solve Africa’s clothes prob­lem?,"Many con­sumers in Africa shun new prod­ucts from China and other coun­tries be­cause of their per­ceived poor qual­ity. THE move to not ban the sale of sec­ond-hand cloth­ing was a re­lief to petty traders. In 2015, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tan­za­nia agreed on a three-year plan to grad­u­ally phase out the im­por­ta­tion of sec­ond-hand clothes and ap­parel from the United States in par­tic­u­lar. Taxes were in­creased ex­po­nen­tially on sec­ond-hand clothes to de­ter more im­ports and a com­plete ban was to take ef­fect in 2019. But the ban would have come at a heavy price. Sens­ing the dan­ger, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion acted fast and is­sued an ul­ti­ma­tum for Fe­bru­ary 23 2018, for these lead­ers to re­scind their plan or face the con­se­quences. The US did this to pro­tect its sec­ond-hand ex­port sec­tor. And on that date be­fore the ul­ti­ma­tum ex­pired, lead­ers from the East Africa re­gion, with the ex­cep­tion of Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, met in Kampala to dis­cuss the reper­cus­sions. In the end they caved in to US de­mands. How­ever, the trade deficit for many African coun­tries is in­stantly recog­nis­able. Im­ports from Rwanda, Tan­za­nia, and Uganda to the US to­talled $43 mil­lion (€34 mil­lion) in 2016, while US ex­ports to the same coun­tries amounted to $281 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the of­fice of the United States Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive (USTR). This is not fair trade as preached by the Amer­i­cans and Euro­peans, and this is why pro­po­nents of this ban ar­gue that these coun­tries have not ben­e­fited much from the African Growth and Op­por­tu­ni­ties Act (AGOA), a brain­child of former US Pres­i­dent Ge­orge W Bush, that was meant to en­able coun­tries in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa to ex­port tex­tiles to the United States. AGOA iron­i­cally ended up ben­e­fit­ing the United States. A ban on sec­ond-hand clothes is premised on the fact that pro­mot­ing East Africa’s tex­tile in­dus­tries will pro­vide thou­sands of jobs. And with this idea at the back of their minds, the lead­ers wanted to bring an end to the pro­tec­tion­ist pol­icy be­ing pushed by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. Now that they have swal­lowed the bit­ter pill, it’s a par­tial vic­tory for the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and busi­ness will con­tinue as usual. To un­der­stand the ef­fect of such a ban if it was to be im­posed, one has to be con­ver­sant with the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and so­cial dy­nam­ics of or­di­nary peo­ple in the three coun­tries. Firstly, down­town mar­kets that serve as the main hubs of sec­ond-hand clothes and shoes em­ploy thou­sands and are a source of much-needed rev­enue for lo­cal gov­ern­ments. Mil­lions in taxes are col­lected on a daily ba­sis, which in re­turn fi­nance projects and other in­fra­struc­ture that the peo­ple also need. And be­sides that, both the poor and the rich buy from these mar­kets, with the lat­ter pre­fer­ring to use mid­dle­men who do the shop­ping for them. The com­mon de­nom­i­na­tor is the quest for qual­ity brands from well-known de­sign­ers like Yves Saint Lau­rent, Gucci, and Dolce &amp; Gab­bana etc. Many con­sumers in Africa shun new prod­ucts from China and other coun­tries be­cause of their per­ceived poor qual­ity. Se­condly, as much as the strug­gle for self-de­pen­dence and liv­ing a dig­ni­fied life is un­der­stand­ably the way to go - coun­tries in East Africa don’t have enough fac­to­ries that can sat­isfy the de­mand for stylish clothes. Africa’s cel­e­brated de­sign­ers also have chal­lenges cater­ing to all styles and wishes. It will take some time be­fore Africans start ap­pre­ci­at­ing the work of their own fashion de­sign­ers. In ad­di­tion to that, many Africans live in ab­ject poverty, and in ru­ral ar­eas, peo­ple live off their small plots of land. How can they af­ford new gar­ments if sur­vival is an­other daily strug­gle? At a lead­er­ship re­treat ear­lier this year in Rwanda, Pres­i­dent Paul Kagame, who never minces his words, put his city may­ors to task to ex­plain why there were mal­nour­ished children who were not at­tend­ing school in some ar­eas? In Rwanda, the gov­ern­ment pro­jected that a ban on sec­ond-hand clothes would cre­ate at least 25 000 jobs. But this fig­ure could be much lower than the num­ber of peo­ple who ac­tu­ally feed their fam­i­lies by sell­ing sec­ond-hand clothes. In the near fu­ture, if Kagame was to im­pose the ban on sec­ond-hand clothes, per­haps Rwan­dans would com­ply be­cause they are known to obey di­rec­tives from their lead­ers. But in neigh­bour­ing Uganda, if the coun­try’s pres­i­dent Yow­eri Mu­sev­eni was to im­pose such a ban, the story would be dif­fer­ent. For many con­sumers, af­ford­abil­ity is what mat­ters most and this is not the time for their gov­ern­ments to start think­ing oth­er­wise. In a con­ti­nent where many peo­ple still live on un­der one dol­lar day, a sec­ond-hand clothes ban cre­ates more prob­lems than so­lu­tions. - DW.",津巴布韦

Min­is­ter Mzembi told the mag­a­zine dur­ing the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly in New York that he was hum­bled and priv­i­leged to have been cho­sen by Zim­babwe, Sadc and the AU as the con­ti­nent’s can­di­date. “Since the es­tab­lish­ment of the UNWTO in 1974, no African has ever be­come its Sec­re­taryGen­eral. Al­most all the ge­o­graph­i­cal ar­eas of the world have pro­duced a sec­re­tary-gen­eral, ex­cept Africa. In fact in 42 years, three sec­re­taries-gen­eral have come from Europe, while one each has come from the Amer­i­cas and Asia. I am there­fore de­lighted to be rep­re­sent­ing my re­gion as the con­ti­nent’s united can­di­date.” Min­is­ter Mzembi is touted as Africa’s long­est-serv­ing tourism min­is­ter. If elected, the mag­a­zine said, Min­is­ter Mzembi would come on board in 2017, dur­ing the “In­ter­na­tional Year of Sus­tain­able Tourism for De­vel­op­ment”. Min­is­ter Mzembi fur­ther told the mag­a­zine that his plan would be to align the three tourism-spe­cific Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals on “de­cent work and eco­nomic growth”, “re­spon­si­ble con­sump­tion and pro­duc­tion” and “life below wa­ter”. Re­gion­ally, he said, he would fur­ther em­bed tourism’s in­ter­ven­tion in the African Union’s Agenda 2063. A for­mer mem­ber of the UNWTO’s Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil, and cur­rent chair­man of the UNWTO’s Com­mis­sion for Africa, Min­is­ter Mzembi was in­stru­men­tal in con­ven­ing the 20th UNWTO Gen­eral Assem­bly in 2013. This global con­fer­ence, which was hosted jointly by Zim­babwe and Zam­bia was de­scribed by the cur­rent Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral, Dr Taleb Ri­fai, as “the best at­tended ever” in the his­tory of the or­gan­i­sa­tion. Dr Ri­fai, a Jor­da­nian na­tional, re­tires next year. Mem­ber­ship of the Madrid­based UNWTO, one of the 17 spe­cialised agen­cies of the United Na­tions, cov­ers 157 coun­tries, six ter­ri­to­ries and 480 af­fil­i­ate groups rep­re­sent­ing the pri­vate sec­tor, ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions, tourism as­so­ci­a­tions and lo­cal tourism author­i­ties. The or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­motes re­spon­si­ble, sus­tain­able and uni­ver­sally ac­ces­si­ble tourism and works to make tourism an ef­fec­tive tool for de­vel­op­ment. “The UNWTO is the world’s lead­ing in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion pro­mot­ing tourism as a driver of eco­nomic growth, en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity and in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment. My vi­sion has al­ways been to use tourism to pro­mote peace, se­cu­rity and so­cial har­mony and if I am ap­pointed, I hope to be able to steer tourism de­vel­op­ment to­wards cli­mate change adap­ta­tion and mit­i­ga­tion, and ul­ti­mately re­duce poverty among com­mu­ni­ties,” Min­is­ter Mzembi told the mag­a­zine. Tourism re­mains one of Africa’s most im­por­tant strate­gic sec­tors, both in terms of em­ploy­ment, for­eign ex­change rev­enues as well as open­ing up the con­ti­nent and its op­por­tu­ni­ties to the world. The UNWTO is set to an­nounce the new sec­re­tary-gen­eral at 22nd Gen­eral Assem­bly in China.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170524,African coun­tries urged to go back to source,"AFRICAN coun­tries should fol­low the foot­prints of the con­ti­nent’s found­ing fathers and drive the African agenda in unity to over­come the chal­lenges they are fac­ing, diplo­mats have said. Speak­ing ahead of Africa Day cel­e­bra­tions to­mor­row, African diplo­mats ac­cred­ited to Zim­babwe said the con­ti­nent should re­main stead­fast and ward off neo-colo­nial­ism, which im­peded de­vel­op­ment. The am­bas­sadors’ sen­ti­ments dove­tail with Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s con­stant re­frain that African lead­ers need to go back to source to avoid sell­ing out the cause of the found­ing fathers who spear­headed the de­coloni­sa­tion of the con­ti­nent. Africa’s found­ing fathers, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said, never vac­il­lated on mat­ters of prin­ci­ple like some in­cum­bents who had lost ground and were al­low­ing their erst­while colonis­ers to dom­i­nate them. Africa Day, which is ob­served on May 25 an­nu­ally, was set aside to com­mem­o­rate the for­ma­tion of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity (OAU) in 1963, which is now known as the African Union. Namib­ian Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Ms Bal­bina Daes Pien­aar said only Africans would de­ter­mine their destiny. She said Africa had suc­cess­fully erad­i­cated colo­nial rule and should now work to­wards eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. “Africa Day is a spe­cial day not only to Africans, but all those who as­so­ciate them­selves with us,” Ms Pien­aar said. “When­ever we talk of Africa Day, our lead­ers have al­ways re­ferred us to the year 1963 when the OAU was born. “With­out the ef­forts of the AU found­ing fathers, I don’t think today we would have emerged. So, it’s time to re­in­force that and work col­lec­tively in unity to take the con­ti­nent to the level of the Africa we want.” Added Ms Pien­aar: “It is time to cel­e­brate the foot­prints of the found­ing fathers bear­ing in mind that we also have our agenda, which should be a suc­cess.” Among other de­vel­op­men­tal poli­cies, Africa is pur­su­ing Agenda 2063 whose thrust is to en­sure all coun­tries on the con­ti­nent en­joy some form of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion by that year that would lead to so­cio-eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. Demo­cratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe and Dean of Diplo­matic Corps, Mr Mwanananga Mwawampanga said Africa Day was time for in­tro­spec­tion. “The day is a spe­cial one to the peo­ple of Africa as it is time to re­flect,” he said. “It is time for us to look at where we are com­ing from, where we are and where we are go­ing. “It is not a day about the lead­ers, it is a day about the youths and the peo­ple of Africa. It is us who should take Africa to where we de­sire. We are a rich con­ti­nent, Africa is the cra­dle of mankind and it is us who should use the re­sources to de­ter­mine our destiny. Fo­cus is not on the lead­ers, but us work­ing as a united front to achieve our goals.” Mr Mwawampanga said African lead­ers had al­ready played their part in terms of pol­icy for­mu­la­tions and what re­mained was for peo­ple to work and cre­ate wealth for their coun­tries. Lead­ers col­lab­o­rate un­der the AU to col­lec­tively ad­dress the chal­lenges the con­ti­nent faces, such as armed con­flict, cli­mate change, dis­eases and poverty. Kenyan rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Harare Am­bas­sador Lucy Che­limo said Africa was be­gin­ning to reap re­wards for fol­low­ing in the foot­steps of its found­ing fathers. “We are be­gin­ning to see an in­creased African voice in the global arena,” she said. “We are see­ing an in­creased voice when it comes to the push for United Na­tions re­forms, an in­creased voice in the United Na­tions World Tourism (UNWTO) and an in­crease in the num­ber of agree­ments like the China-Africa and Euro­pean Union-Africa agree­ments. “Africa Day is a day we must cel­e­brate with pride be­cause our im­por­tance is be­ing put to a higher scale be­cause of the African Union. With­out the found­ing fathers, we would not be cel­e­brat­ing.” On Zim­babwe, Am­bas­sador Che­limo said: “As we cel­e­brate the day, I want to say spe­cial thanks to Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe for shap­ing of the vi­sion of Agenda 2063. It is from 2015 when he was AU chair­man that we now have a more fo­cused pro­gramme. “We thank him for the guid­ance. He gave us a foun­da­tion of thought and now we are be­gin­ning to see so­lu­tions be­ing sought to African prob­lems.” Am­bas­sador Che­limo said more re­sources should be chan­nelled to­wards em­pow­er­ing youths. Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs of the Republic of Turkey H.E.Mev­lut Cavu­soglu said Africa’s fu­ture was promis­ing. ‘’Africa is un­der­go­ing im­mense change. The pos­i­tive trans­for­ma­tion is fu­elled by the hard work, re­silience and per­se­ver­ance of Africans young and old who are de­ter­mined to turn the page of poverty. “We have ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve that Africa’s fu­ture looks promis­ing. In fact, we can see the pos­i­tive mo­men­tum re­flected through re­duced geopo­lit­i­cal risks, sus­tained sta­bil­ity, eco­nomic growth, ex­pand­ing trade, en­hanced wel­fare and bet­ter liv­ing con­di­tions across the Con­ti­nent. Chal­lenges to peace and se­cu­rity still ex­ist. But they can cer­tainly be over­come,’’ he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170110,"Africa poised for sus­tain­able growth, but . . .","AS WE know, growth ac­cel­er­a­tions are pretty com­mon­place among de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. Economist Ri­cardo Hauss­man and his col­leagues iden­ti­fied 83 growth ac­cel­er­a­tions of eight con­sec­u­tive years at 2 per­cent higher than the five-yearly av­er­age be­tween the mid-1950s and early 2000s. But most growth ac­cel­er­a­tions, and es­pe­cially those in Africa, were short­lived. They did not form the foun­da­tion of a long-term step-change to a more di­ver­si­fied growth path. Draw­ing on the lan­guage of Amer­i­can economist W. W. Ros­tow, most growth ac­cel­er­a­tions don’t amount to a “take-off”. The risk fol­low­ing the re­cently ended booms is that, due to in­suf­fi­cient plan­ning and ex­ces­sive op­ti­mism, the wind­falls of growth ac­cel­er­a­tions were wasted. Have the growth ac­cel­er­a­tions com­pletely fiz­zled out? Have some African coun­tries used the op­por­tu­ni­ties in re­cent decades to im­ple­ment ef­fec­tive longer term growth and de­vel­op­ment strate­gies? Growth pat­terns over three decades Since the early 1990s many African coun­tries have been on a tra­jec­tory of higher growth. To the sur­prise of many ob­servers the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2007-2009 did not spell the end of Africa’s growth surge, though the rate of growth moder­ated. More re­cently African growth has slowed fur­ther. At around 4 per­cent in GDP terms it is con­sid­er­ably lower than the 6 per­cent plus for emerg­ing Asia. Yet growth re­mains stronger than in the “lost decades” be­tween the mid-1970s and mid1990s. And Africa’s de­vel­op­men­tal per­for­mance has im­proved con­sid­er­ably since the early 1990s. It is ev­i­dent that African poverty and in­fant mor­tal­ity, while still lag­ging, have im­proved sig­nif­i­cantly. There have been sim­i­lar im­prove­ments in ed­u­ca­tion ac­cess and im­prove­ments in in­fras­truc­ture such as roads and elec­tric­ity. The higher rate of growth has been a valu­able as­set, though it is by no means the only fac­tor which has al­lowed de­vel­op­men­tal im­prove­ments. While these have them­selves con­trib­uted to growth, the cur­rent rel­a­tively low growth rate in­hibits the pace of the im­prove­ment in the lives of peo­ple. As Amadou Sy points out: “If the re­gion was able to re­gain its 2004-2014 growth rate GDP per capita could be dou­bled in 20.5 years, by 2036. In con­trast, at a [per capita] growth rate of 1,4 per­cent as cur­rently pre­dicted, this achieve­ment would only be re­alised in 50 years, by the year 2065.” Why growth has slowed To get a real sense of why growth has slowed, we first need to ask why the pe­riod since the mid-1990s was so much bet­ter than the pre­vi­ous two decades. The com­mod­ity su­per-cy­cle, cen­tred on China’s huge pub­lic and pri­vate in­vest­ments, was the stand­out eco­nomic fac­tor due to the de­mand for African prod­ucts. Later China’s cap­i­tal sur­plus al­lowed it to of­fer huge cred­its for in­fras­truc­ture in­vest­ments. But in­di­ca­tors show that growth and de­vel­op­ment im­prove­ments be­gan in Africa be­fore the com­mod­ity su­per-cy­cle, other fac­tors were also at play. Clearly im­por­tant was the com­ple­tion of Africa’s lib­er­a­tion - par­tic­u­larly the demo­cratic tran­si­tions in south­ern Africa. South Africa’s post-demo­cratic growth had sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the rest of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. This was mostly through out­ward in­vest­ment by South Africa’s multi­na­tion­als, but also through ris­ing trade. The South Africa fac­tor is a sub­set of the pos­i­tive im­pact of the end of the Cold War. This al­lowed greater do­mes­tic ac­count­abil­ity and im­proved gov­er­nance in many African coun­tries. The im­prove­ments in gov­er­nance in turn cre­ated an en­vi­ron­ment that fre­quently en­cour­aged direct and in­di­rect in­vest­ment. Eco­nomic pol­icy risks African growth slowed af­ter the global cri­sis. But the slow­down was not as rapid as ini­tially feared. This was partly be­cause of global mit­i­ga­tion mea­sures (for ex­am­ple trade credit liq­uid­ity) and partly be­cause African growth was also driven by ris­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion and in­vest­ment. Growth has slowed down more in re­cent years in most African coun­tries un­der the shadow of sev­eral eco­nomic pol­icy risks. By these, I mean risks which can be less­ened or deep­ened, de­pend­ing on the qual­ity of eco­nomic pol­icy. Even af­ter the global eco­nomic cri­sis, sev­eral African coun­tries were able to em­bark on sov­er­eign bond is­sues for the first time. Be­fore 2006, only South Africa had is­sued a sov­er­eign bond in Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Since 2009, 14 other coun­tries have is­sued a to­tal of US$17 bil­lion in sov­er­eign bonds. In 2014 alone sub-Sa­ha­ran sov­er­eigns, ex­clud­ing South Africa, is­sued US$6,3 bil­lion of for­eign-cur­rency de­nom­i­nated bonds. Ex­cept in South Africa, the bonds were gen­er­ally is­sued in for­eign cur­ren­cies on ex­pec­ta­tion of re­ceipts from the con­tin­ued ex­port of com­modi­ties. But faced with lower than ex­pected tax rev­enues as com­mod­ity prices fell, sev­eral coun­tries used bond fi­nance for cur­rent ex­pen­di­ture rather than cap­i­tal in­vest­ments. It is ar­guable that by 2014 in­vestors should have been wary of high-yield sov­er­eign bond sales. The In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) is much busier than it has been in Africa since the height of the debt for­give­ness pro­gramme. It has gone as far as to call for a “pol­icy re­set” on the con­ti­nent. The im­pact of twin deficits - for­eign cap­i­tal ac­count and fis­cal - is po­ten­tially greater than sim­ply a sharp and tem­po­rary slow­down. Since the early 1990s, demo­cratic gov­ern­ments in Africa have de­rived some of their le­git­i­macy from slowly but steadily im­prov­ing liv­ing con­di­tions. Cut-backs po­ten­tially threaten the le­git­i­macy of open democ­ra­cies. The Zam­bian gov­ern­ment de­layed en­ter­ing into ne­go­ti­a­tions for re­lief from the IMF un­til af­ter re­cent elec­tions. If the in­evitable debt re­struc­tur­ings are not care­fully de­signed there are po­ten­tial risks to po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity. The sec­ond ma­jor eco­nomic pol­icy risk is that growth is tem­pered with high lev­els of in­equal­ity. High in­equal­ity re­duces the im­pact of growth on poverty, and grow­ing in­equal­ity is slow to re­verse. Africa has a high­est Gini co-ef­fi­cient among con­ti­nents. If these in­equal­ity lev­els can­not be re­duced, the sus­tain­abil­ity of growth in the re­gion will be com­pro­mised. Fi­nally, is it fea­si­ble that Africa will meet, let alone beat the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goal of dou­bling the share of em­ploy­ment and out­put at­trib­ut­able to the in­dus­trial sec­tor? Much of the in­crease in em­ploy­ment and value added in re­cent decades has come from the ser­vices sec­tor - now over 50 per­cent of value added. In a study of 72 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries span­ning 1996 to 2012, the UNU-Wider project found that 66 (or 88 per­cent) had be­come more de­pen­dent on ex­trac­tives dur­ing the com­mod­ity su­per­cy­cle. De­vel­op­ing a man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor re­quires man­age­rial com­pe­tence, suf­fi­ciently skilled work­ers and a good or im­prov­ing in­fras­truc­tural en­vi­ron­ment.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201024,‘Zim needs sanc­tions lifted to de­velop’,"PRES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa has called on the world to rally be­hind SADC’s quest to have il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe by the West re­moved to en­able the coun­try to re­alise its full po­ten­tial. In his vir­tual ad­dress to the United Na­tions Di­a­mond An­niver­sary to­day, the Pres­i­dent said coun­tries like Zim­babwe were sur­viv­ing un­der dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances be­cause of the eco­nomic sanc­tions that also af­fect their ef­forts, in this crit­i­cal Decade of Ac­tion, to­wards achiev­ing the 2030 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. His ad­dress comes a day be­fore Zim­babwe is joined by SADC coun­tries in an un­prece­dented re­gional show of sol­i­dar­ity in call­ing for the United States and her al­lies, that uni­lat­er­ally im­posed the il­le­gal sanc­tions to im­me­di­ately lift the puni­tive eco­nomic em­bar­goes. “The peo­ple of Zim­babwe re­main bur­dened and ham­strung by the un­just uni­lat­eral il­le­gal eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed by West­ern coun­tries. The im­pact of th­ese mea­sures on af­fected coun­tries is well doc­u­mented and con­firmed by UN ex­perts and hu­man­i­tar­ian prac­ti­tion­ers. “As the world marks the 75th an­niver­sary and cel­e­brates UN Day un­der the theme, ‘The fu­ture we want, the UN we Need’, and within the con­text of the call for a Decade of Ac­tion and mea­sures for a post-Covid-19 world; let us re­main mind­ful of the dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances faced by the peo­ple and the coun­tries liv­ing un­der sanc­tions. “With re­gards to Zim­babwe, there­fore, this time is most op­por­tune for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to rally be­hind the call by SADC for the un­con­di­tional re­moval of all il­le­gal eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed on our coun­try.” He added, “This is the only way to en­able the coun­try to fully par­tic­i­pate and im­ple­ment the very no­ble pro­grammes be­ing cham­pi­oned by the UN and other in­ter­na­tional part­ners; at na­tional, re­gional and global lev­els.” Un­der the spite­ful sanc­tions, im­posed at the turn of the mil­len­nium by West­ern coun­tries as pu­n­ish­ment for the land re­form pro­gramme, Zim­babwe has lim­ited ac­cess to mul­ti­lat­eral and fi­nan­cial sup­port from in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions, with dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects on or­di­nary peo­ple espe­cially chil­dren and women. The il­le­gal eco­nomic sanc­tions, that are blind to the Sec­ond Repub­lic’s re-en­gage­ment ef­forts and the far reach­ing po­lit­i­cal re­forms that have been un­der­taken to en­trench con­sti­tu­tion­al­ism, have lim­ited Zim­babwe’s ca­pac­ity to re­spond to the cur­rent Covid-19 pan­demic. How­ever, only a few West­ern coun­tries re­main ob­sti­nate to the progress be­ing un­der­taken by the Sec­ond Repub­lic, with SADC na­tions in the spirit of sol­i­dar­ity to­mor­row tak­ing a bold stance for the sec­ond in two years in call­ing for the un­con­di­tional re­moval of sanc­tions. In Zim­babwe the rul­ing Zanu PF party has been joined by the coun­try’s main op­po­si­tion MDC party in the call for the re­moval of sanc­tions with op­po­si­tion par­ties, churches and civic or­gan­i­sa­tions ex­pected to take part in the anti-sanc­tions day to­mor­row. The Pres­i­dent told the fam­ily of na­tions that the eco­nomic shocks caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic are yet again a re­minder to the world of the need for mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism as op­posed to uni­lat­er­al­ism. “Go­ing for­ward, Zim­babwe reaf­firms its com­mit­ment to con­tinue work­ing with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity in fight­ing the pan­demic, in­formed by the de­sire to en­sure that no one is left be­hind.” The Pres­i­dent added that Zim­babwe was in sup­port of calls by the UN sec­re­tary gen­eral An­tónio Guter­res and World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) di­rec­tor Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus for the Covid-19 vac­cine to be treated as a global pub­lic good, with guar­an­teed dis­tri­bu­tion and mech­a­nisms to en­sure equal ac­cess. To­mor­row Zim­babwe marks the sec­ond an­niver­sary of the SADC Anti-Sanc­tions Day in full ob­ser­vance of the Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions as the coun­try con­tin­ues to ob­serve the WHO rec­om­mended guide­lines. “Zim­babwe is re­form­ing, but we are be­ing held back from truly thriv­ing as a coun­try. I in­vite the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to see the re­moval of in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions not as an act of char­ity but as an op­por­tu­nity to see Zim­babwe re­alise its full po­ten­tial,” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. FOR two decades, Zim­babwe has been placed un­der il­le­gal, uni­lat­eral sanc­tions. Th­ese sanc­tions are hurt­ing. They are not just hurt­ing the so called “tar­geted in­di­vid­u­als and en­ti­ties” as falsely claimed by their en­forcers, but also hurt­ing the en­tire coun­try and its or­di­nary peo­ple. For a coun­try to de­velop, a nor­mal and con­ducive ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment is es­sen­tial. Sanc­tions tar­nish Zim­babwe’s in­ter­na­tional im­age, spook in­vestors, dis­rupt fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions be­tween Zim­babwe and for­eign coun­tries and dis­able Zim­babwe from ac­cess­ing lines of credit from In­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions, which are es­sen­tially needed for the de­vel­op­ment of a coun­try. Th­ese are facts be­yond dis­pute. The sanc­tions pro­duced de­bil­i­tat­ing ef­fects on the econ­omy and gen­eral pop­u­lace, not re­lent­ing even as in­no­cent Zim­bab­weans suf­fered from nat­u­ral dis­as­ters such as Cy­clone Idai, se­vere drought, and a global pan­demic. Their spillover ef­fects in the re­gion are vis­i­ble. While there has been a heart­en­ing, re­ver­ber­at­ing call for an end to them across the con­ti­nent and be­yond, de­ci­sion-mak­ers in some cap­i­tals re­main re­cal­ci­trant. But Zim­babwe trudged on with dig­nity. The Gov­ern­ment ac­tively pro­motes a com­pre­hen­sive re­form agenda. Against the odds of man­made hur­dles and ad­verse nat­u­ral forces, it has man­aged to bring about or­der in the econ­omy and pro­tect its peo­ple fairly well from a pan­demic that has rocked even the rich­est coun­tries. Iron­i­cally, those who wield uni­lat­eral sanc­tions do not hes­i­tate to use mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions to crit­i­cise Zim­babwe for some of th­ese ef­forts. This re­veals a deeper, struc­tural prob­lem in our world to­day: a few pow­ers re­main con­vinced they can dic­tate how other coun­tries de­velop; they are not bound by in­ter­na­tional law, the ba­sic norms of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, or the pur­poses and prin­ci­ples of the UN Char­ter. Rather, they can se­lec­tively ap­ply th­ese in­ter­na­tional in­stru­ments and values when it is con­ve­nient and abuse them when nec­es­sary. Dan­ger­ous, but not new. For a con­sid­er­able pe­riod in his­tory, the tram­pling th­ese sacro­sanct values set free the all too fa­mil­iar evils of im­pe­ri­al­ism, colo­nial­ism, and slav­ery. Th­ese ter­ri­ble hu­man in­ven­tions have been pro­nounced dead on pa­per as we mark the 75th an­niver­sary of the UN and the vic­tory over fas­cism this year. But, as the case of Zim­babwe shows, they still lurk deep in some minds and in the global ar­chi­tec­ture of power. All those who have been sub­jected to their bru­tal­ity can­not af­ford to not be vig­i­lant. But the days when de­vel­op­ing na­tions suf­fered silently and sep­a­rately are gone. To­day, we are united in our voices and ac­tions. On 6 Oc­to­ber, the Chi­nese rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­liv­ered a state­ment on be­half of a group of coun­tries at the UN Gen­eral As­sem­bly. The state­ment crit­i­cized the uni­lat­eral coercive mea­sures for im­ped­ing the full re­al­iza­tion of so­cial and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and hin­der­ing the well-be­ing of the pop­u­la­tion in the af­fected coun­tries, par­tic­u­larly the vul­ner­a­ble. It reaf­firmed China’s call for the com­plete and im­me­di­ate lift­ing of uni­lat­eral coercive mea­sures for a full, ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient re­sponse of all mem­bers of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to COVID-19. It ex­pressed deep re­gret for the loss of vul­ner­a­ble lives to racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity and the dis­pro­por­tion­ately high mor­tal­ity rates of peo­ple of African des­cent in places where they are a mi­nor­ity. It urged the full im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Hu­man Rights Coun­cil res­o­lu­tion which pro­vides for “the pro­mo­tion and pro­tec­tion of the hu­man rights and fun­da­men­tal free­doms of Africans and of peo­ple of African des­cent against ex­ces­sive use of force and other hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions by law en­force­ment of­fi­cers”. Say­ing no to in­jus­tices is not enough. De­vel­op­ing coun­tries must also com­bine their forces to make our world a fair and re­spect­ful place. Last month at the UN, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pro­posed China’s vi­sion for the role of the or­gan­i­sa­tion in the post-Covid 19 world. He called on the UN to stand firm for jus­tice, up­hold the rule of law, pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion, and fo­cus on real ac­tion. Th­ese prin­ci­ples also work in a larger con­text in terms of what kind of a world we should as­pire to build. To pro­mote jus­tice, there must be mu­tual re­spect and equal­ity among all coun­tries. No coun­try has the right to dom­i­nate global af­fairs, con­trol the des­tiny of oth­ers, or keep ad­van­tages in de­vel­op­ment all to it­self. Even less should one be al­lowed to do what­ever it likes and be the hege­mony, bully or boss of the world. Uni­lat­er­al­ism is a dead end. It is im­per­a­tive that the rep­re­sen­ta­tion and voice of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries be in­creased. To up­hold the rule of law, the pur­poses and prin­ci­ples of the UN Char­ter must be the fun­da­men­tal guide­lines for han­dling in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. Re­la­tions among coun­tries and co­or­di­na­tion of their in­ter­ests must only be based on rules and in­sti­tu­tions; they must not be lorded over by those who wave a strong fist at oth­ers. There must be no prac­tice of ex­cep­tion­al­ism or dou­ble stan­dards. Nor should in­ter­na­tional law be dis­torted and used as a pre­text to un­der­mine other coun­tries’ le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests or world peace and sta­bil­ity. To pro­mote co­op­er­a­tion, the Cold War men­tal­ity, ide­o­log­i­cal prej­u­dice and zero- sum game should be re­jected. In place of con­flict, co­er­cion, and zero-sum game, there should be di­a­logue, con­sul­ta­tion and win-win re­sults. We need to pur­sue the com­mon in­ter­ests of all as we each work to safe­guard our own in­ter­ests. We need to ex­pand the con­verg­ing in­ter­ests of all and build a big global fam­ily of har­mony and co­op­er­a­tion. To take real ac­tion, we must get down to solv­ing prob­lems and mea­sure our­self against tan­gi­ble out­comes. Se­cu­rity, de­vel­op­ment as well as hu­man rights should be ad­vanced in par­al­lel. The is­sue of de­vel­op­ment should be high­lighted in the global macro frame­work; and there should be a greater em­pha­sis on the pro­mo­tion and pro­tec­tion of the rights to sub­sis­tence and de­vel­op­ment. His­tor­i­cally, in­jus­tices in in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions forced the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries into sub­ju­ga­tion and poverty. To­day, they are still hold­ing them back in in­de­pen­dently choos­ing a path of de­vel­op­ment. This has to change. Push­ing for the re­moval of uni­lat­eral sanc­tions on Zim­babwe is a good start­ing point. ◆ Guo Chaochun is Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe. Niko­lai V. Krasil­nikov 2020 is a spe­cial year since all the good­will peo­ple cel­e­brate the 75th an­niver­sary of the vic­tory in the Sec­ond World War, the 75th An­niver­sary of es­tab­lish­ing the United Na­tions and the 60th an­niver­sary of the UN dec­la­ra­tion on the grant­ing of in­de­pen­dence to colo­nial coun­ties and peo­ple. Rus­sia be­lieves it is un­ac­cept­able to turn a blind eye to at­tempts of pro­mot­ing neo-colo­nial prac­tices. It is ob­vi­ous that one of such ways of mak­ing neg­a­tive im­pact on so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ments is the mech­a­nism of uni­lat­eral coercive mea­sures de­signed to force regime change, such as sanc­tions im­posed on the Repub­lic of Zim­babwe for al­most 20 years and main­tained by the Unites States and the Euro­pean Union. Th­ese re­stric­tions are il­le­git­i­mate as they by­pass the United Na­tions. Amid global econ­omy cri­sis uni­lat­eral po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated re­stric­tive mea­sures block ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional credit mar­kets and ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies, in­clud­ing in health care. At the dark time of the pan­demic their im­moral and in­hu­man char­ac­ter is high­lighted. The Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion and like­minded states as well as mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions have been con­stantly call­ing for abol­ish­ing the un­law­ful mea­sures. As the Pres­i­dent of the Rus­sian Fed­er­a­tion Vladimir Putin em­pha­sized at Rus­sia-Africa Sum­mit in Sochi last year; “We in­vari­ably ad­vo­cate the prin­ci­ple stip­u­lat­ing African so­lu­tions for African prob­lems”. We ex­press sol­i­dar­ity with SADC coun­tries in ob­serv­ing Oc­to­ber 25 as Anti-Sanc­tions Day to pro­vide the strong sup­port to the Repub­lic of Zim­babwe. Rus­sia’s prac­ti­cal as­sis­tance in this re­gard is be­ing re­vealed in the United Na­tions where we raise the voice against uni­lat­eral coercive mea­sures as well as through in­vest­ments and trans­fer of tech­nolo­gies into Zim­babwe. The Rus­sian-Zim­bab­wean joint ven­ture, Great Dyke In­vest­ments ( GDI), is de­vel­op­ing one of the world’s largest plat­inum group met­als ( PGM) de­posits in Dar­wen­dale on the ba­sis of the 2014 In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Agree­ment ex­pects to pro­duce the first con­cen­trate in 2022. The Gov­ern­ment of the Repub­lic of Zim­babwe em­pha­sizes the key role of Dar­wen­dale in at­tain­ing the 2023 mile­stone of US$ 12 bil­lion ex­ports from the min­ing sec­tor. The GDI man­age­ment pays spe­cial at­ten­tion to dis­charg­ing so­cial obli­ga­tions. To date, more than 300 res­i­dents of Mashona­land West province have been em­ployed. As­sis­tance has been pro­vided to the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion on a reg­u­lar ba­sis, in­clud­ing pre­ven­tion of the coron­avirus and pro­tec­tion of the en­vi­ron­ment. The Al­rosa Zim joint ven­ture launched prospect­ing works this year. In July 2020 ge­ol­o­gists started sam­pling in Mali­pati zone, with ground geo­phys­i­cal sur­vey to fol­low. It is ex­pected that to­wards the end of year the same prospect­ing op­er­a­tions will be con­ducted in the Mait­engwe area. Bulk sam­pling and drilling are to com­mence in 2021. The ven­ture en­vis­ages US$ 12 mil­lion in­vest­ment up to 2022. Rus­sian fer­tiliser com­pany Ecorost has started im­port­ing or­ganic fer­til­iz­ers made of peat. Rus­sian and Zim­bab­wean busi­ness­men are pre­par­ing to in­crease the sup­ply and to set up a man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in Mutare. The ex­per­i­ments of the Ecorost prod­ucts will be con­ducted on the sites of the De­part­ment of Agri­tex with the as­sis­tance of the De­part­ment of Re­search and Spe­cial­ist Ser­vices to iden­tify the agro­nomic ef­fi­ciency in cul­ti­va­tion of dif­fer­ent crop plants and forestry as well as to es­ti­mate the ca­pac­ity of man­u­fac­tur­ing in Zim­babwe.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170620,Back to the fu­ture for ANC foreign pol­icy?,"LATER this month South Africa’s rul­ing party be­gins its five-yearly pol­icy con­fer­ence to de­ter­mine the di­rec­tion to be taken by the new African Na­tional Congress (ANC) pres­i­dent who will be elected in De­cem­ber. This is as­sum­ing that that per­son also be­comes South Africa’s pres­i­dent af­ter the 2019 na­tional elec­tions. Last week Edna Molewa, chair of the ANC’s sub-com­mit­tee on in­ter­na­tional relations (and na­tional en­vi­ron­ment min­is­ter), pre­sented the party’s draft in­ter­na­tional relations doc­u­ment to be dis­cussed at the pol­icy con­fer­ence. The doc­u­ment will then be adopted at the na­tional elec­tive con­fer­ence in De­cem­ber. The doc­u­ment is founded on the over­ar­ch­ing prin­ci­ple of “pro­gres­sive in­ter­na­tion­al­ism”. This is de­fined as “a rad­i­cal per­spec­tive of in­ter­na­tional relations that the lib­er­a­tion move­ment de­vel­oped out of the strug­gle for lib­er­a­tion . . . it en­tails op­po­si­tion to the per­pet­u­a­tion of the legacy of global im­pe­ri­al­ism man­i­fest in the global power asym­me­try, the dom­i­nance of the global North over the South and the world, struc­tural global in­equal­ity and poverty”. Etcetera. You can feel the nos­tal­gia. As three no­table foreign pol­icy an­a­lysts wrote in a provoca­tive re­sponse to the pol­icy pa­per, the ANC’s “per­spec­tives on power dy­nam­ics in the world have trav­elled back in time, and are frozen in a world that no longer ex­ists”. Chris Lands­berg and Mzuk­isi Qobo of the Uni­ver­sity of Jo­han­nes­burg and Fran­cis Korne­gay of the In­sti­tute for Global Di­a­logue con­tin­ued that since 2009 (the year Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma came to power) “the ANC has failed to of­fer an­i­mat­ing ideas about the coun­try’s place in the world”. And, later, “the party sees the world as static and the tools with which to deal with the world look the same as those that were ap­pli­ca­ble over six decades ago. The party seems to have sleep­walked through the changes of the 1980s and the 1990s. There is an ob­ses­sion in the pa­per with state sovereignty, but noth­ing of the rights of peo­ple against ex­cesses by the very state elites who use the cover of sovereignty against state pow­ers”. The au­thors also ac­cuse the drafters of blam­ing an un­favourable in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment — of ris­ing na­tion­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism — for South Africa’s eco­nomic ills, rather than the ANC govern­ment’s own in­ter­nal po­lit­i­cal fac­tion fight­ing and pol­icy am­biva­lence. Last week, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (the foun­da­tion of Ger­many’s So­cial Demo­cratic Party — a his­toric ANC ally) and the ANC (led by Molewa) held a sem­i­nar in Jo­han­nes­burg to dis­cuss the party’s pol­icy doc­u­ment. To be fair to the ANC, a few an­a­lysts pointed out that the doc­u­ment was an im­prove­ment on pre­vi­ous it­er­a­tions. Though “unashamedly” still rooted in so­cial­ist ide­ol­ogy, as an ANC rep­re­sen­ta­tive said, the pa­per does ac­knowl­edge some con­tem­po­rary re­al­i­ties. It gives greater em­pha­sis, for ex­am­ple, than pre­vi­ous ver­sions to the con­tin­u­ing im­por­tance of the North (aka the West) in South Africa’s foreign relations. That’s hardly sur­pris­ing when the Euro­pean Union (EU) is still by far South Africa’s largest trad­ing part­ner and aid donor and when South Africa ex­ports more value-added goods to the EU and US by far than to its close ally China. And where pre­vi­ous foreign pol­icy dis­cus­sion doc­u­ments railed at the US Africa Com­mand (AFRICOM) — an ob­vi­ous light­ning rod for ide­o­log­i­cal in­dig­na­tion — this year’s pa­per takes a more nu­anced view. On the one hand, it warns that: “We must be wary of coun­tries in the North, par­tic­u­larly the United States (and its al­lies) as well as France in its for­mer colonies, in­volv­ing it­self by mil­i­tary means on the con­ti­nent.” On the other, it ad­vises that the ANC ex­am­ine AFRICOM more closely, “since it may take the form of mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion in the form of the war against ter­ror­ism or drugs, as op­posed to a United States mil­i­tary base be­ing es­tab­lished”. Also, to be fair, the ANC pol­icy doc­u­ment ac­knowl­edges that the world has changed in other ways from the grand ide­o­log­i­cal set piece bat­tle scene it paints in its pre­am­ble. It recog­nises that its great Southto-South cham­pion BRICS (Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa) is fray­ing at the edges. A con­ser­va­tive lead­er­ship has re­placed the Work­ers’ Party in Brazil and another con­ser­va­tive party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is tak­ing over from the ANC’s his­tor­i­cal ally, the In­dian Na­tional Congress, in New Delhi. — ISS Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190809,Will CITES fail Africa for the 44th year?,"Cur­rently, most SADC ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties shar­ing their land with wildlife are show­ing signs that it is too late to achieve sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment by 2030. They go bare­foot, poor, hungry, and hope­less, with­out clean drink­ing wa­ter, de­cent health­care or ad­e­quate ed­u­ca­tional fa­cil­i­ties. They suf­fer th­ese con­di­tions be­cause African wildlife can’t pay for it­self while the ban on ivory and rhino horn trade, and lim­i­ta­tions on hunt­ing, re­main in force. DI­VI­SIONS among Africans coun­tries were signed and sealed at the Berlin Con­fer­ence in 1884-1885 that par­ti­tioned Africa into colonies un­der dif­fer­ent Western Euro­pean gov­ern­ments’ con­trol. The Berlin Con­fer­ence reg­u­lated Euro­pean coloni­sa­tion and trade in Africa. Even in cases where Africans try to unite Western pow­ers al­ways want to di­vide them, in or­der to ex­ploit them. To­day, Africa has never re­cov­ered from such di­vi­sions even in the area of wildlife con­ser­va­tion and trade in its wildlife prod­ucts such as ivory and rhino horns. African coun­tries are made to op­pose one an­other for no good rea­son. There­fore, it is un­sur­pris­ing that Western an­i­mal rights groups and some Western coun­tries con­tinue to suc­cess­fully in­flu­ence West, North and East African coun­tries to op­pose SADC coun­tries’ bid to trade in ivory and rhino horn even to hunt ele­phants and rhi­nos. This year, SADC coun­tries have made pro­pos­als to trade in ivory, rhino horn and hunt rhino to the UN Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional in En­dan­gered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). The fi­nal de­ci­sion will be made at the CITES 18th tri­en­nial meet­ing that will be held in Geneva, from Au­gust 17-28, 2019. Sadly, a group of 10 coun­tries (com­pris­ing nine African coun­tries and one Arab na­tion) have al­ready op­posed their fel­low South­ern African coun­tries’ bid to ben­e­fit from their wildlife through trade. They have in­cred­i­bly sug­gested in a counter pro­posal that the ele­phant pop­u­la­tions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zim­babwe be moved from Ap­pen­dix II to Ap­pen­dix I, ef­fec­tively pre­vent­ing SADC coun­tries from us­ing their wildlife. Th­ese op­po­si­tion coun­tries in­clude Burk­ina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Kenya, Liberia, Niger, Nige­ria, Su­dan, Syr­ian Arab Repub­lic and Togo. Al­though the pop­u­la­tion of white rhi­nos in Eswa­tini (for­merly known as Swazi­land) is listed on Ap­pen­dix II, an an­no­ta­tion cur­rently pre­vents in­ter­na­tional trade in rhino horn. Eswa­tini has pro­posed the re­moval of this an­no­ta­tion so that it can sell an ex­ist­ing stock of 330kg of rhino horn and then 20kg per year from non-lethal har­vest­ing. Namibia pro­posed to trans­fer its pop­u­la­tion of white rhi­nos from Ap­pen­dix I to II with an an­no­ta­tion solely for the sale of live an­i­mals to ap­pro­pri­ate and ac­cept­able des­ti­na­tions and for hunt­ing tro­phies, with all other spec­i­mens to re­main on Ap­pen­dix I. Zam­bia pro­posed to down­list its ele­phant pop­u­la­tion from Ap­pen­dix I to Ap­pen­dix II to per­mit sales of reg­is­tered ivory stocks to CITES-ap­proved buyers as well as some spec­i­fied non-ivory trade. Mean­while, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zim­babwe would like to trade in reg­is­tered ivory stocks to CITES Sec­re­tariat-ver­i­fied part­ners as well as some spec­i­fied non-ivory trade. They pro­posed to do this by amend­ing an an­no­ta­tion that, al­though their ele­phant pop­u­la­tions are listed in Ap­pen­dix II, cur­rently dis­al­lows trade. How­ever, all th­ese SADC coun­tries’ pro­pos­als have al­ready been op­posed by nine fel­low African coun­tries, be­fore they even get de­bated at CoP18 in Geneva, Switzer­land, this month. De­spite this op­po­si­tion on the African con­ti­nent, SADC coun­tries should not give up the fight to be granted their sov­er­eign rights to trade in their ivory rhino horn and even to hunt their white rhino as Namibia pro­poses to do. The South­ern African coun­tries have vi­able ele­phant and rhino pop­u­la­tions com­pared to Western an­i­mal rights in­flu­enced fel­low African coun­tries that are un­jus­ti­fi­ably op­pos­ing their pro-sus­tain­able use pro­pos­als. De­spite this op­po­si­tion from fel­low African coun­tries, SADC coun­tries might just get the sup­port they need from other CITES mem­ber coun­tries. This has hap­pened be­fore. For ex­am­ple, in 1997 and 2000, recog­nis­ing that some South­ern African ele­phant pop­u­la­tions were healthy and well man­aged, CITES mem­ber coun­tries agreed to down­list the pop­u­la­tions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zim­babwe to Ap­pen­dix II. In 1999 and again in 2008, sales of reg­is­tered stocks of gov­ern­ment-owned ivory from th­ese coun­tries were au­tho­rised to China and Ja­pan. How­ever, one of the ma­jor crit­i­cisms against the tem­po­rary and not per­ma­nent per­mis­sion to trade in ivory and rhino horn is that the few cases when CITES per­mits ivory sales for SADC coun­tries do not bring great hope for achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in South­ern Africa, through use of wildlife. This is a missed op­por­tu­nity for the achieve­ment of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in the SADC re­gion, for which CITES mem­ber coun­tries that con­tinue to un­jus­ti­fi­ably vote against trade in ivory and of course rhino horn should be held ac­count­able. Is CITES Un­der­go­ing Re­forms? In­ter­est­ingly, in the press re­lease that the CITES Sec­re­tariat re­leased this week, al­most 10 days be­fore the 18th CITES tri­en­nial meet­ing, the Sec­re­tariat has an­nounced am­bi­tious plans that could re­verse the fail­ures that it has been as­so­ci­ated with for the past 44 years. Among them, the need to in­volve the voice­less, al­most for­got­ten and “pow­er­less” ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties in the CITES de­ci­sion-mak­ing process. “The con­fer­ence will also con­sider op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­hance the role of indige­nous, lo­cal and/or ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties in CITES de­ci­sion-mak­ing pro­cesses and how to fur­ther strengthen col­lab­o­ra­tion with other bio­di­ver­sity-re­lated con­ven­tions,” said the CITES Sec­re­tariat press re­lease. De­spite be­ing con­sid­ered as one of the ma­jor stum­bling blocks to­wards achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment by 2030 in SADC coun­tries be­cause of its con­tin­ued block­ade of trade in ivory and rhino horn, the CITES Sec­re­tariat is sur­pris­ingly say­ing it will come up with mea­sures to help achieve this, just 11 years away from 2030 a UN set dead­line dead­line for achiev­ing sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment world­wide, in­clud­ing Africa. What a wel­come sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment magic bul­let, if that ever hap­pens. The CITES Sec­re­tariat said that it was go­ing to present for dis­cus­sion and adop­tion at CITES CoP18 in Geneva, a Strate­gic Vi­sion Post-2020 that aims to en­sure that, “by 2030, all in­ter­na­tional trade in wild fauna and flora is le­gal and sus­tain­able, con­sis­tent with the long-term con­ser­va­tion of species, and thereby con­tribut­ing to halt­ing bio­di­ver­sity loss”. It also high­lights CITES’ role in con­tribut­ing to the achieve­ment of the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment. It re­mains to be seen whether or not th­ese pro­posed changes are at long last a CITES Sec­re­tariat ad­mis­sion that the con­tin­ued ban of trade in wildlife prod­ucts for the past 44 years have dis­mally failed to stop rhino and ele­phant poach­ing as well as il­le­gal rhino horn and ivory trade. It has al­ways been ar­gued that the ban in ivory and rhino horn has not saved a sin­gle rhino and ele­phant, nei­ther has it helped to stop both il­le­gal rhino horn and ivory trade. The truth is that the ban in th­ese prod­ucts fu­els de­mand. There­fore, CITES should in its new signs of re­forms go fur­ther to adopt a new strat­egy that ad­mits that trade not aid will save the African rhi­nos and ele­phants. It should aban­don the one-shoe-size-fits-all ap­proach when de­cid­ing on which coun­tries de­serve to trade in their wildlife prod­ucts. This means they should ex­clu­sively use each coun­try’s ele­phant and rhino pop­u­la­tion as a yard­stick to grant it per­mis­sion to trade in rhino horn and ivory. The same goes for de­ci­sions on grant­ing hunt­ing quo­tas for ele­phants and rhi­nos, etc. Sadly, the CITES press re­lease did not an­nounce any planned re­forms to in­ves­ti­gate and stop the vote rig­ging scan­dals aimed at pre­vent­ing trade in ivory and rhino horn at any cost; within the CITES de­ci­sion-mak­ing frame­work that many con­ser­va­tion­ists world­wide (in­clud­ing those from Africa) have com­plained about for years with no ac­tion be­ing taken against the cul­prits (Western an­i­mal rights groups). It is such re­forms that can re­store CITES’ cred­i­bil­ity that has con­tin­ued to be damaged by the Western an­i­mal rights groups’ anti-use agenda to the detri­ment of ele­phant and rhino con­ser­va­tion as well as the African peo­ple’s so­cio-eco­nomic well-be­ing. With­out trade in ivory, rhino horn and with­out hunt­ing, Africa can­not gen­er­ate rev­enue to look af­ter its wildlife. Con­se­quently, African gov­ern­ments are forced to di­vert funds from cen­tral trea­sury bud­gets that were meant for poverty al­le­vi­a­tion pro­grammes and use them for wildlife con­ser­va­tion. This means that it is al­ways go­ing to be very dif­fi­cult for af­fected African coun­tries to lift them­selves out poverty as funds meant for the im­prove­ment of hu­man life con­tinue to go to wildlife con­ser­va­tion be­cause wildlife con­tin­ues to fail to pay for its own up­keep. When funds meant for build­ing schools, hos­pi­tals, roads and dams are used for wildlife con­ser­va­tion it means Africa re­mains paral­ysed in poverty. Cur­rently, most SADC ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties shar­ing their land with wildlife are show­ing signs that it is too late to achieve sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment by 2030. They go bare­foot, poor, hungry, and hope­less, with­out clean drink­ing wa­ter, de­cent health­care or ad­e­quate ed­u­ca­tional fa­cil­i­ties. They suf­fer th­ese con­di­tions be­cause African wildlife can’t pay for it­self while the ban on ivory and rhino horn trade, and lim­i­ta­tions on hunt­ing, re­main in force. There­fore, one won­ders how the CITES Sec­re­tariat hopes to achieve sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment in South­ern Africa as long as the ban on in­ter­na­tional trade in rhino horn and ivory is still in force, with hunt­ing mar­kets be­ing cru­elly shut down. ◆ Em­manuel Koro is a Jo­han­nes­burg-based in­ter­na­tional award-win­ning en­vi­ron­men­tal jour­nal­ist who has writ­ten ex­ten­sively on en­vi­ron­ment and de­vel­op­ment is­sues in Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150531,Time Africa stood on her own,"can be solved by Africans alone. Rush­ing to west­ern cap­i­tals seek­ing for so­lu­tions brings noth­ing, but di­vi­sions to the con­ti­nent. Africa should cor­rect past mis­takes that led other African lead­ers to be as­sas­si­nated and oth­ers to be ar­raigned be­fore the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court (ICC). For ex­am­ple the as­sas­si­na­tion of Muam­mar Gaddaffi by the Libyan rebels sup­ported by the so­called al­lied forces and the ar­rest and sub- se­quent trial and con­vic­tion of for­mer Liberian leader Charles Tay­lor by the ICC was made pos­si­ble be­cause some African lead­ers chose to be aligned to the west­ern coun­tries that had their own goals. So such mis­takes should not be re­peated, hence Africa should unite and fight to­gether against ex­ter­nal forces that seek to divide the con­ti­nent. It is high time that the African con­ti­nent be­gan to talk with one voice so as to earn re­spect glob­ally. The trend which has been hap­pen­ing in Africa is that African lead­ers have been ma­nip­u­lated by west­ern coun­tries who wanted them to dance ac­cord­ing to their tune. In ac­tual fact, west­ern coun­tries have used that colo­nial bondage to op­press African coun­tries to the ex­tent that African coun­tries be­came aligned to their for­mer colonis­ers in an un­healthy re­la­tion­ship which is ret­ro­gres­sive in terms of devel­op­ment. The fact that west­ern coun­tries like Bri­tain, France, Italy and Ger­many, among oth­ers that ar­ranged and planned to colonise Africa at the Ber­lin Congress in 1884, planted their colo­nial lega­cies in the dif­fer­ent African states made it easy for them to ma­nip­u­late what­ever African states might think and plan to do. African lead­ers should stand guided by Pan- African­ism that gives the con­cept of ubuntu as the way for­ward in de­cid­ing and plan­ning what the African con­ti­nent needs to do. In fact, Africa should now be vo­cal in cham­pi­oning the needs for the Africans in the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, es­pe­cially when they at­tend the United Na­tions ( UN) Gen­eral As­sem­bly. It is re­fresh­ing that the AU has now cho­sen 10 coun­tries that have come to be known as the Com­mit­tee of 10 (C10) to cham­pion the ne­go­ti­a­tions with the su­per pow­ers so that they al­low an African coun­try to have a per­ma­nent seat in the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (UNSC). The C10 which started the ball rolling more than two years ago is cur­rently hav­ing meet­ings with var­i­ous coun­tries which are in the UNSC as a way of mak­ing sure that they ac­cept the con­ti­nent’s plea. The UNSC which com­prises Bri­tain, China, France, Rus­sia and the US has been made up of those coun­tries since the for­ma­tion of the UN in 1945, mak­ing it im­pos­si­ble for other coun­tries to get their voices heard. So the C10, which com­prises Al­ge­ria, Congo DR, Equa­to­rial Guinea, Kenya, Libya, Namibia, Sene­gal, Sierra Le­orne and Zam­bia, should be com­mended for the good work they are do­ing in con­fronting the UNSC so that it is re­formed. For that rea­son, all African states should re­main united and al­ways speak with one voice dur­ing in­ter­na­tional sum­mits or meet­ings so that African in­ter­ests are not tram­pled upon.",津巴布韦

Nige­ria will sur­pass the US with the world’s third-big­gest labour force. That stretch­ing age bracket — 15 to 64-year-olds — gives Africans an edge in pro­duc­tive po­ten­tial and upward mo­bil­ity to lift cit­i­zens out of poverty. But har­ness­ing it will mean de­liv­er­ing hun­dreds of mil­lions of new jobs and cre­at­ing more ro­bust ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing for young peo­ple. Now, the con­ti­nent isn’t cre­at­ing jobs fast enough and em­ploy­ment gaps stem from a lack of spe­cialised school­ing. Most Africans are un­em­ployed, un­der­em­ployed or stuck in the in­for­mal econ­omy, and the pri­vate sec­tor is just too small to ab­sorb them. While low wages should draw job-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries — par­tic­u­larly man­u­fac­tur­ing — away from China and Viet­nam where salaries are ris­ing, Africa’s poor in­fra­struc­ture raises the cost of do­ing busi­ness by so much that it negates the sav­ings from labour, ac­cord­ing to Mr John Ash­bourne, an Africa econ­o­mist at Lon­don-based Cap­i­tal Economics. Three-quar­ters of Africans don’t have ac­cess to elec­tric­ity, and even grid-con­nected busi­nesses suf­fer reg­u­lar black­outs, so they of­ten rely on pricier diesel gen­er­a­tors. Mov­ing goods is ex­pen­sive be­cause roads are pot­holed and grid­locked, while ports and air­ports are clogged. In some cases, cor­rup­tion and in­se­cu­rity add to the cost of in­vest­ment. Ris­ing in­comes have led to an in­creas­ing num­ber of African stu­dents with the means to pay for ed­u­ca­tion, yet even those with univer­sity de­grees of­ten can’t find work be­cause their skills don’t match the need, swelling the ranks of un­em­ployed. “While ed­u­ca­tional out­comes are im­prov­ing across Africa, the re­sults are still much worse than in po­ten­tial com­peti­tors abroad, par­tic­u­larly in terms of tech­ni­cal and vo­ca­tional ed­u­ca­tion, which has been to­tally over­looked in much of Africa,” Mr Ash­bourne said. “It is dif­fi­cult to see how these economies can be re­struc­tured rapidly enough to pro­duc­tively and ef­fi­ciently ab­sorb this sort of de­mo­graphic bulge.” In some sce­nar­ios, the op­por­tu­nity of a grow­ing work­force could ac­tu­ally turn into a risk. Idle and frus­trated youth are a prime re­cruit­ment tar­get for vi­o­lent move­ments or be­come a bur­den on state ser­vices, where those ex­ist in Africa.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20150825,South Su­dan leader to sign peace deal to­day,"JUBA/KI­GALI. — South Su­dan’s Pres­i­dent Salva Kiir has fi­nally agreed to sign a peace deal and power-shar­ing ac­cord to end a 20-month civil war, his spokesman said yesterday. Pres­i­den­tial spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told AFP that the pres­i­dents of Kenya, Uganda and Su­dan plus Ethiopia’s prime min­is­ter “will con­verge on Juba to­mor­row morn­ing (to­day) for a one-day sum­mit, and the Pres­i­dent of the Re­pub­lic of South Su­dan will sign the peace agree­ment.” The spokesman said, how­ever, that the gov­ern­ment was still un­happy with the ac­cord, drawn up by the re­gional bloc IGAD. “The gov­ern­ment has some reser­va­tions . . . even if the Pres­i­dent will sign,” Mr Ateny said. South Su­dan’s rebel leader Riek Machar, a for­mer vice pres­i­dent, signed the deal last Mon­day, in line with a dead­line to do so. Both sides in the con­flict have been fac­ing the threat on in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions if they refuse to sign. But Pres­i­dent Kiir only ini­tialled part of the text, and his gov­ern­ment slammed the ac­cord as a “sell-out” - say­ing it needed more time for con­sul­ta­tions. Key is­sues of dis­agree­ment in­clude de­tails of a power-shar­ing pro­posal be­tween the gov­ern­ment and rebels, which could see Machar re­turn as vice-pres­i­dent. Ateny also said the gov­ern­ment was un­happy over calls to de­mil­i­tarise the cap­i­tal Juba, hand over greater pow­ers to the rebels in the oil-rich Up­per Nile re­gion, and see for­eign­ers in charge of a Mon­i­tor­ing and Eval­u­a­tion Com­mis­sion - the body that will po­lice the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the peace deal. Sources in IGAD also con­firmed plans for the deal to be signed in Juba on Wed­nes­day, with Kenyan Pres­i­dent Uhuru Keny­atta, Ugan­dan Pres­i­dent Yow­eri Mu­sev­eni, Su­danese Pres­i­dent Omar al-Bashir, Ethiopian Prime Min­is­ter Haile­mariam De­salegn and chief me­di­a­tor Sey­oum Mesfin due to at­tend. An IGAD of­fi­cial said rebel leader Machar would not be there be­cause se­cu­rity pro­vi­sions were not yet in place. South Su­dan’s civil war erupted in De­cem­ber 2013 when Kiir ac­cused Dr Machar of plan­ning a coup, set­ting off a cy­cle of re­tal­ia­tory killings that has split the poverty-stricken, land­locked coun­try along eth­nic lines. Marked by wide­spread atroc­i­ties on both sides, the war has been char­ac­terised by eth­nic mas­sacres and rape. At least seven cease­fires have al­ready been agreed and then shat­tered within days — if not hours — in the world’s new­est coun­try, which broke away from Su­dan in 2011. The peace pro­posal has been put for­ward by the re­gional eight-na­tion bloc IGAD, the In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Au­thor­ity on De­vel­op­ment, as well as the United Na­tions, African Union, China and the “troika” of Bri­tain, Nor­way and the US. — AFP/Xin­hua.",津巴布韦

Amai Mnan­gagwa is also the OAFLAD vice pres­i­dent, a po­si­tion she got in recog­ni­tion of her hard work. This year’s theme for OAFLAD is “Gen­der Equal­ity and Women Em­pow­er­ment: A Path­way to the Africa We Want” and it dove­tails with work al­ready be­ing done by Amai Mnan­gagwa to en­sure women con­trib­ute mean­ing­fully to the coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. The OAFLAD meet­ing is be­ing held on the side­lines of the African Union ( AU) sum­mit. The First Lady has rolled out women em­pow­er­ment projects across Zim­babwe. As a way of em­pow­er­ing women, she re­cently took a team of women in busi­ness to China where they met and shared notes with their coun­ter­parts on how best they can im­prove their busi­nesses and con­trib­ute to the coun­try’s eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. “It was mo­ti­vat­ing to see that most part­ners shared what they were do­ing with the Of­fices of First Ladies. One of the is­sues dis­cussed is to do with HIV and Aids, the Free to Shine Cam­paign. Amai Mnan­gagwa has al­ready launched this cam­paign and she is run­ning with it. “We have al­ready re­ceived more sup­port from de­vel­op­ment part­ners be­cause of the ex­cel­lent way she has launched this cam­paign so that we con­tinue com­mu­ni­cat­ing the Free to Shine cam­paign to our com­mu­ni­ties, es­pe­cially en­cour­ag­ing mothers who are liv­ing pos­i­tively with the virus to con­tinue to be on treat­ment and to en­sure that their chil­dren are on treat­ment as well. It’s very en­cour­ag­ing that in Zim­babwe, de­spite all the chal­lenges we have, we have a very proac­tive First Lady,” said Mrs Dube. Dr Bernard Madz­ima from the Min­istry of Health and Child Care paid trib­ute to Amai Mnan­gagwa for her char­ity work. “We have part­ners who have come to en­gage OAFLAD as an or­gan­i­sa­tion, but it is in­ter­est­ing to note that for Zim­babwe, or­gan­i­sa­tions like Merck Foun­da­tion and UNAIDS have al­ready been work­ing with Amai. This is good be­cause I would say that we are al­ready ahead in terms of en­gage­ment with them as part­ners. “As you know, OAFLAD is en­gaged in ac­tiv­i­ties which pro­mote health and so­cial well-be­ing. So we are tak­ing stock of the work which has hap­pened in 2019, ba­si­cally look­ing at the bud­gets, look­ing at the ac­tiv­i­ties, whether we have met our tar­gets or not, es­pe­cially in pro­grammes of HIV and Aids pre­ven­tion and con­trol. But we are also look­ing at other ar­eas like non- com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases, is­sues of nutrition and poverty. So the First Ladies and tech­ni­cal teams have come here to take stock and plan for 2020,” he said. On non- com­mu­ni­ca­ble diseases, Amai Mnan­gagwa, who is also the coun­try’s health am­bas­sador, has been hold­ing free cancer- screen­ing pro­grammes for both men and women to al­low for early di­ag­no­sis and early treat­ment. Dr Madz­ima said dur­ing the meet­ing, part­ners made pre­sen­ta­tions on how best they can work with the Africa First Ladies. “To­day ( yes­ter­day) we have po­ten­tial part­ners in the name of Global Al­liance for Vac­cines. We also had Merck Foun­da­tion and UNAIDS. So all these or­gan­i­sa­tions are pitch­ing to work with the First Ladies. There is also the roll­back malaria, which is work­ing in all coun­tries in Africa. So the meet­ing is a tech­ni­cal meet­ing which then in­forms their Ex­cel­len­cies across Africa when they meet in their steer­ing com­mit­tee and in the gen­eral assem­bly over the week­end.” Back home, the First Lady, through her An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion, has rolled out a num­ber of pro­grammes to up­lift peo­ple’s lives.

The pat­ter of rain­drops is al­ways a sweet life-giv­ing sym­phony for the hard­work­ing farmer and an ir­ri­tat­ing ca­coph­ony for lazy sloths. Rain is life. Its im­mi­nence, which we were told by our fore­fa­thers was some­times con­jured, is al­ways var­i­ously cel­e­brated by dif­fer­ent cul­tures. Bishop Lazi re­cently told you how dance was in­te­gral to African story-telling and was de­signed to per­pet­u­ate cul­tural val­ues, norms, tra­di­tions and world­view. The Mbende-Jerusalem dance, for ex­am­ple, grad­u­ally mor­phed from a fer­til­ity dance to a sym­bol of re­sis­tance against an in­vad­ing Western cul­ture that con­demned it as im­moral and wanted to sup­plant it with equally sul­try ball­room dances. As Bantu peo­ple, we had and have rain dances that we use or used — what­ever suits your be­liefs — to cel­e­brate or con­jure rains. To get an in­ti­mate un­der­stand­ing of this phe­nom­e­non, you might need to look no fur­ther than the play­wright, poet, au­thor, his­to­rian and bi­og­ra­pher Pathisa Ny­athi, who is a liv­ing repos­i­tory of our cul­tural trea­sure. As founder of Amagugu In­ter­na­tional Her­itage Cen­tre, Ny­athi had an in­sight­ful in­ter­view with the Bri­tish Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (BBC)’s Zeinab Badawi in July 2017 on the twin sig­nif­i­cance of some of our lo­cal tra­di­tional dances to his­tory and rain-mak­ing. He talked her through why most dancers in lo­cal rain-mak­ing cer­e­monies in­vari­ably wore black, strapped leg rat­tles that would chat­ter to the thumb­ing sounds of throb­bing drum beats, and all the while yo­delling un­in­tel­li­gi­ble hyp­notic lyrics that were in­ter­spersed by the chants of “Ne­horeka!” “The first thing that we need to know is that mu­sic and dance are art forms, and art is ex­pres­sive. It is a form of doc­u­men­ta­tion,” he re­marked. “Africa did not write, but this is not to say Africa did not doc­u­ment. Africa doc­u­mented through vis­ual art; through per­for­mance art. And it tells a lot about the peo­ple, their his­tory, their val­ues, their per­cep­tions and their world­view. It is all about sym­bol­ism. “The colour black is a cloud preg­nant with wa­ter, and then there were these leg rat­tles, and then that is when now it is rain­ing – cha-chacha-cha-cha. The sound from the drum — go­ing boom! boom! — is the sound of thun­der. Then you have cre­ated the sound of rain. And then their move­ment — the chore­og­ra­phy — it is the twirling clouds.” It was a pow­er­ful in­ter­pre­ta­tion of a sa­cred African dance. You might ask if Bishop Lazi be­lieves in all this sup­posed hocus po­cus. Well, the Bishop will un­for­tu­nately con­cede that he hasn’t wrapped his head around all these world mys­ter­ies, but would gladly con­sider the sub­mis­sions that were made by Pathisa Ny­athi to the BBC. He said: “There are peo­ple who think that we un­der­stand this world through the eyes of one cul­ture. I don’t be­lieve that one. This world is too com­plex to be un­der­stood, in­ter­preted by one cul­ture, but what has hap­pened is that there are cul­tures (Western cul­ture) that think they are su­pe­rior to other cul­tures and their view of this world is THE view, and this has been the prob­lem.” Ab­surd What­ever the de­bate around rain­mak­ing, at least we can all agree — be­liever and non-be­liever; re­li­gious and non-re­li­gious; the fool­ish and the wise; Dy­namos and High­landers sup­port­ers — that wa­ter is life. For a na­tion that sorely com­plains a lot about food short­ages and food prices, we eat a lot, sleep a lot, but we do not pro­duce a lot. We do not find it em­bar­rass­ing to gor­man­dise boul­der-sized morsels of pap (sadza/ isitshwala) cooked from mealie-meal whose grain would have been im­ported from as far as Mex­ico, Tan­za­nia and other far-off lands. Kikikiki. We hap­pily munch on bread made from flour whose wheat would have been im­ported from Rus­sia and sim­i­larly far-flung coun­tries. We do not find it shame­ful to be importing onions, pota­toes and other veg­eta­bles which we could or­di­nar­ily pro­duce in our backyard. We hap­pily pay for all these pro­vi­sions in for­eign cur­rency; the same for­eign cur­rency which we so des­per­ately need. Iron­i­cally, the far-off farmer be­comes richer and hap­pier, while the lo­cal farmer be­comes poorer and mis­er­able. Just to get a sense of this ab­sur­dity, Zim­babwe imports ce­re­als worth around US$800 mil­lion ev­ery year, which amount can make a dif­fer­ence if it is ei­ther paid to the lo­cal farmer or in­vested in lo­cal agri­cul­tural ac­tiv­i­ties. The im­pact in terms of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and qual­ity of liveli­hood can be im­mense. So, para­dox­i­cally, how can we fail to ad­e­quately fund and rev­o­lu­tion­arise our agri­cul­ture and agri-busi­ness sec­tor if we can af­ford to spend close to a stag­ger­ing US$1 bil­lion importing food­stuffs? This is ut­ter non­sense! It is an ano­maly that has even riled the Nige­ri­ans, whose Pres­i­dent, Muham­madu Buhari, ap­par­ently worked up by this odd­ity, tweeted last week: “I am re­stat­ing it that no­body importing food or fer­tiliser should be given for­eign ex­change from the cen­tral bank. We will not pay a kobo of our for­eign re­serves to im­port food or fer­tiliser. We will in­stead em­power lo­cal farm­ers and pro­duc­ers.” Kikikiki. But one thing the Bishop finds un­bear­ably mor­ti­fy­ing is the spec­ta­cle of Zim­babwe, which is home to only 13 mil­lion souls, re­ceiv­ing rice do­na­tions from China, our peren­ni­ally re­li­able ally which, how­ever, has 1,3 bil­lion mouths of its own to feed. China has man­aged the re­mark­able feat of feed­ing 20 per­cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion from just 9 per­cent of the world’s arable land. You see, the Chi­nese long re­alised that a hun­gry and rum­bling stom­ach feeds a toxic tongue. This ob­vi­ously de­fines the pol­i­tics of the stom­ach, which shape na­tional pol­i­tics. Yet Zim­babwe stands in bet­ter stead to feed her­self and the en­tire re­gion. Not only is it prob­a­bly the most dammed coun­try on the con­ti­nent with more than 10 000 wa­ter bod­ies, but it is blessed with fer­tile soils ca­pa­ble of grow­ing a va­ri­ety of food and cash crops, in­clud­ing favourable and en­vi­able cli­matic con­di­tions. Pi­tiably low lo­cal pro­duc­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity, which keeps Zim­babwe des­per­ate, es­pe­cially af­ter the land re­form pro­gramme at the turn of the mil­len­nium, works well for for­eign pol­icy in­ter­ests of the pow­ers and forces that are op­posed to the coun­try’s suc­cess, as they can al­ways use it as a de­ter­rent ex­am­ple to any coun­try dar­ing to even con­sider right­fully re­pos­sess­ing its own land as Zim­babwe did. The spe­cious nar­ra­tive that cur­rently ex­ists claims that Zim­babwe finds it­self in the cur­rent chal­lenges be­cause it “fool­ishly” took back the land from “ex­pe­ri­enced” white farm­ers who were mag­nan­i­mously feed­ing it over the past cen­tury. Con­versely, suc­cess would em­bolden other coun­tries to fol­low suit. This is why Zim­babwe can­not be for­given and has to con­tinue to suf­fer. Turn­ing the tide Thank­fully, the tide is be­gin­ning to turn. Proverbs 6:10-11 warns us that: “A lit­tle sleep, a lit­tle slum­ber, a lit­tle fold­ing of hands to rest, and poverty will come upon you like a rob­ber, and want like an armed man.” As Bishop Lazi told you last week, even as the com­mis­sioned in­fantry of naïve op­po­si­tion par­ties con­tin­ues to make as much noise as pos­si­ble on so­cial me­dia by rak­ing up and stak­ing up vit­ri­olic tweets against the estab­lish­ment, Pres­i­dent ED con­tin­ues to in­de­fati­ga­bly work. The mean­ing­less noise from ephemeral hash­tags can­not pos­si­bly drown out the dron­ing and growl­ing sounds of ma­chines that are open­ing up land for pro­duc­tion in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try. A mir­a­cle is presently un­der­way in Kanyemba, where more than 276 hectares have al­ready been cleared. By win­ter next year, a stag­ger­ing 2 000 hectares will have been opened up. Over­all, 10 000 to 15 000ha will be cleared. This is the same ef­fec­tive strat­egy that was used by Brazil to open the Ama­zo­nia for pro­duc­tion. Con­nec­tion of a power line from the Luangwa Dis­trict of Zam­bia, which will pro­vide elec­tric­ity for the ir­ri­ga­tion projects, is now im­mi­nent. It is that se­ri­ous! You might be aware that ear­lier this year Gov­ern­ment flighted a ten­der for com­pa­nies that were in­ter­ested in clear­ing 100 000 ha in Kanyemba, Bu­l­awayo Kraal in Mata­bele­land North and at Tugwi Mukosi. An­other mir­a­cle is hap­pen­ing in the Lowveld, where en­thu­si­as­tic farm­ers have also jumped on board to put more hectares — in fact more than 8 000ha — un­der win­ter maize. Cre­at­ing two crop­ping sea­sons will be able to aug­ment lo­cal pro­duc­tion. Af­ter en­dur­ing count­less prom­ises from the old ad­min­is­tra­tion, the peo­ple who are served by Chilinga Ir­ri­ga­tion Scheme (Masvingo) and Bu­l­awayo Kraal in Mata­bele­land North (15 000ha) can now heave a huge sigh of re­lief as the former has been re­vived, while trench­ing for the much-needed new pipes for the lat­ter is well un­der­way. This is progress. Tied to plans to in­crease pro­duc­tion by ex­pand­ing the hec­tarage put un­der var­i­ous crops is the con­scious ef­fort to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity through in­creas­ing the area cov­ered by ir­ri­ga­tion. It is en­vis­aged that through the Ac­cel­er­ated Ir­ri­ga­tion De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme, 45 000ha of ir­ri­ga­ble land that cur­rently lies idle will be re­sus­ci­tated. The grand scheme is to even­tu­ally have 200ha in ev­ery dis­trict. Ear­lier this year, Gov­ern­ment inked a deal with Maka Re­sources, a lo­cal com­pany, to re­vamp and re­sus­ci­tate 100 000ha of ir­ri­ga­tion schemes. Need the Bishop also men­tion the US$50 mil­lion mech­a­ni­sa­tion deal with US’s John Deere? Bishop Lazi can go on and on. But these are the grand plans. A pha­lanx of close to 2 mil­lion com­mu­nal farm­ers al­ready stand ready to de­ploy the new model (Pfumvudza) of pro­duc­ing un­der epilep­tic weather con­di­tions in­duced by cli­mate change. All these plans were out­lined in the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) and are be­ing in­cu­bated through the Agri­cul­ture and Food Sys­tems Trans­for­ma­tion Strat­egy, which was launched on Au­gust 26. The only dif­fer­ence be­tween old and new plans un­der the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion is that the new sher­iffs are in­cred­i­bly ef­fi­cient and ef­fec­tive when it comes to de­liv­ery and ex­e­cu­tion. Some peo­ple un­der­es­ti­mate the im­pact of sta­ble prices and a sta­ble Zim­babwe dol­lar — which must now be de­fended at all cost — on the value of pro­ducer prices. Sta­bil­ity gives just and lu­cra­tive re­ward to the hard­work­ing farmer and al­low for smooth prepa­ra­tions and fu­ture plan­ning. As the twit­terati con­tinue to an­a­lyse and over-an­a­lyse what is cur­rently go­ing on as “the man in the arena” does what he knows best — de­liv­er­ing what he promised — when they even­tu­ally fig­ure out what is hap­pen­ing it would al­ready be too late. The Bishop can only as­sure them that their mo­ment of epiphany, which will fore­bode their come­up­pance, will come soon enough. When will they re­alise that this ad­min­is­tra­tion means busi­ness — lit­er­ally and fig­u­ra­tively? Bishop out!",津巴布韦
zw,Business Weekly (Zimbabwe),20200925,New steps needed to im­prove sov­er­eign debt work­outs,"COVID-19 has greatly length­ened the list of de­vel­op­ing and emerg­ing mar­ket economies in debt dis­tress. For some, a cri­sis is im­mi­nent. For many more, only ex­cep­tion­ally low global in­ter­est rates may be de­lay­ing a reck­on­ing. De­fault rates are ris­ing, and the need for debt re­struc­tur­ing is grow­ing. Yet new chal­lenges may ham­per debt work­outs un­less gov­ern­ments and mul­ti­lat­eral lenders pro­vide better tools to nav­i­gate a wave of re­struc­tur­ing. The IMF, the World Bank, and other mul­ti­lat­er­als acted quickly to pro­vide much­needed fund­ing amid the pan­demic as gov­ern­ment rev­enues col­lapsed along­side eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, while pri­vate cap­i­tal flows came to a sud­den stop. In ad­di­tion to new loans from mul­ti­lat­er­als, Group of Twenty (G20) cred­i­tors granted a debt mora­to­rium to the world’s poor­est coun­tries. They have en­cour­aged pri­vate lenders to fol­low suit — al­beit with lit­tle suc­cess. So far, the pan­demic shock has been lim­ited to the poor­est coun­tries and has not mor­phed into a full-blown mid­dle-in­come emerg­ing mar­ket debt cri­sis. Thanks in part to favourable global liq­uid­ity con­di­tions con­ferred by mas­sive cen­tral bank sup­port in ad­vanced economies, pri­vate cap­i­tal out­flows have mod­er­ated and many mid­dle-in­come coun­tries have been able to con­tinue to bor­row in global cap­i­tal mar­kets. Ac­cord­ing to the IMF, emerg­ing mar­ket gov­ern­ments is­sued US$124 bil­lion in hard cur­rency debt dur­ing the first six months of 2020, with two-thirds of the bor­row­ing com­ing in the sec­ond quar­ter. Yet there are still rea­sons for con­cern about sus­tained emerg­ing mar­ket ac­cess to cap­i­tal mar­kets. The riski­est pe­riod may still lie ahead. The first wave of the pan­demic is not over. Ex­pe­ri­ence from the 1918 in­fluenza pan­demic sug­gests the pos­si­bil­ity of an even more se­vere sec­ond wave, es­pe­cially if it takes un­til mid-2021 (or later) for an ef­fec­tive vac­cine to be­come widely avail­able. Even in the best-case sce­nario, in­ter­na­tional travel will face road­blocks, and un­cer­tainty among con­sumers and busi­nesses is likely to re­main high. World poverty has risen sharply, and many peo­ple will not be re­turn­ing to work when the cri­sis passes. The po­lit­i­cal ram­i­fi­ca­tions of the cri­sis in ad­vanced economies are also still un­fold­ing. The back­lash against glob­al­i­sa­tion, al­ready ris­ing be­fore Covid-19, may in­ten­sify. Al­though many emerg­ing mar­ket gov­ern­ments have suc­ceeded in bor­row­ing more in lo­cal currencies, busi­nesses have con­tin­ued to ac­cu­mu­late for­eign cur­rency debt. Un­der se­vere duress, it’s likely that emerg­ing mar­ket gov­ern­ments would yield to pres­sure to bail out their cor­po­rate na­tional cham­pi­ons, just as the United States and Europe have done. On top of the dra­matic re­treat in pri­vate fund­ing, re­mit­tances from emerg­ing mar­ket cit­i­zens work­ing in other coun­tries are ex­pected to drop by more than 20 per­cent this year. At the same time, bor­row­ing needs have sky­rock­eted, as emerg­ing mar­ket and de­vel­op­ing economies con­tend with the same bud­getary stresses as ad­vanced economies. Health sys­tems must be strength­ened and sup­port must be pro­vided for cit­i­zens whose lives are af­fected most acutely. Bor­row­ing needs will only rise fur­ther as the eco­nomic dam­age mounts. Ris­ing bud­get pres­sures have been ac­com­pa­nied by a new wave of sov­er­eign debt down­grades, sur­pass­ing peaks dur­ing prior crises. They have per­sisted even as ma­jor ad­vanced econ­omy cen­tral banks have eased credit con­di­tions. Cen­tral bank pur­chases of cor­po­rate bonds to pro­vide sup­port for lo­cal firms in emerg­ing mar­ket and de­vel­op­ing economies have also hand­i­capped their debt rat­ings. His­tory shows that it is not un­usual that coun­tries can keep bor­row­ing even when de­fault risk is high. A re­view of 89 de­fault episodes from 1827 to 2003 shows the typ­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence to be a sharp rise in bor­row­ing, both ex­ter­nal and do­mes­tic, in the run-up to de­fault (Rein­hart and Ro­goff 2009). Ide­ally this time will be dif­fer­ent, but the record is not en­cour­ag­ing. Amid mas­sive and syn­chro­nous fi­nanc­ing needs across a broad swath of coun­tries, there is brew­ing in the back­ground a grow­ing need for debt re­struc­tur­ings in num­bers not seen since the debt cri­sis of the 1980s. Of­fi­cial cred­i­tors should be pre­pared to act as needed. Here they will be im­peded by two trends that have been de­vel­op­ing in­de­pen­dently of the Covid-19 cri­sis. Call them “pre­ex­ist­ing con­di­tions.” First, pri­vate cred­i­tors are in­creas­ingly claim­ing out­size shares of re­pay­ment in debt re­struc­tur­ings. Al­though the­o­ret­i­cally the of­fi­cial sec­tor is a se­nior cred­i­tor to the pri­vate sec­tor, much of the his­tor­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence sug­gests oth­er­wise. Dur­ing the 1980s emerg­ing mar­ket debt cri­sis, pri­vate cred­i­tors were quite suc­cess­ful at pulling out funds as of­fi­cial cred­i­tors went in ever deeper (Bu­low, Ro­goff, and Bevilaqua 1992). Sim­i­lar de­vel­op­ments were at play dur­ing the Euro­pean debt cri­sis, when in­vestors did take some losses in Greece; a large por­tion of their funds had been pulled out, with re­pay­ments fa­cil­i­tated by large-scale loans by euro area gov­ern­ments (Zet­telmeyer, Trebesch, and Gu­lati 2013). This pat­tern has re­curred over two cen­turies of pri­vate and of­fi­cial lend­ing: when pri­vate in­vestors re­trench, of­fi­cial lenders of­ten step in (Horn, Rein­hart, and Trebesch 2020). A re­cent anal­y­sis com­par­ing losses (hair­cuts) taken by of­fi­cial and pri­vate cred­i­tors raises fur­ther doubt about the sup­posed se­nior­ity of of­fi­cial sec­tor loans (Sch­legl, Trebesch, and Wright 2019). These out­comes should not be sur­pris­ing. Af­ter all, gov­ern­ments have a his­tory of pro­tect­ing do­mes­tic cred­i­tors who lent abroad (think north­ern Euro­pean banks in the case of Greece), and at the same time also care about sta­bil­ity and wel­fare in the bor­row­ing coun­try. Such al­tru­ism, in turn, weak­ens the of­fi­cial sec­tor’s bar­gain­ing po­si­tion — es­pe­cially vis-à-vis pri­vate cred­i­tors. Thus, of­fi­cial cred­i­tors may be left hold­ing the bag for the bulk of the losses, even when they start with lit­tle of the out­stand­ing debt, as in Greece. A fur­ther chal­lenge comes from new hold­out and lit­i­ga­tion tac­tics by pri­vate in­vestors to re­sist large debt write-downs and re­struc­tur­ings. As the num­ber of re­struc­tur­ings has de­clined, an in­creas­ing share of them have in­volved law­suits. While this may not com­pletely ex­plain the pri­vate sec­tor’s suc­cess in max­imis­ing its share in debt re­struc­tur­ing, it is dis­con­cert­ing. The sec­ond pre­ex­ist­ing con­di­tion is the length of time debt crises are drag­ging on. As former Citibank chair­man Wil­liam Rhodes fa­mously said dur­ing the debt cri­sis of the 1980s: “It is easy to get into a debt mora­to­rium. It’s tough to get out.” De­fault episodes have taken, on av­er­age, seven years to re­solve and typ­i­cally in­volve mul­ti­ple re­struc­tur­ings. Un­for­tu­nately, debt re­struc­tur­ings can be­come a bar­gain­ing game in which the coun­try debtor is of­ten (rightly) will­ing to ex­change higher fu­ture debt for lower pay­ments now, fully in­tend­ing to re­struc­ture debt again as nec­es­sary. De­lay also helps both sides bar­gain for larger in­fu­sions from of­fi­cial cred­i­tors. Cred­i­tors may of­ten be will­ing to re­peat­edly re­new (or “ever­green”) debt in or­der to tem­po­rar­ily make their bal­ance sheets look better. The Covid-19 cri­sis could, in the worst case, lead to an­other “lost decade” in devel­op­ment, with long de­lays in debt res­o­lu­tion. What can gov­ern­ments and mul­ti­lat­eral lenders do to make sure new fund­ing ends up ben­e­fit­ing the cit­i­zens of debtor coun­tries af­fected by the pan­demic rather than lin­ing the pock­ets of cred­i­tors? And how can they make debt re­struc­tur­ing more ex­pe­di­ent? Here are three prac­ti­cal ideas: More trans­parency on debt data and debt con­tracts It is of ut­most im­por­tance that the World Bank, the IMF, and the G20 con­tinue to in­sist on strength­en­ing the trans­parency of debt sta­tis­tics. A new and sig­nif­i­cant com­pli­ca­tion in as­sess­ing the ex­ter­nal in­debt­ed­ness of many de­vel­op­ing economies in­volves China, which has be­come the largest bi­lat­eral cred­i­tor in re­cent years. Un­for­tu­nately, China’s lend­ing is of­ten shrouded in non dis­clo­sure clauses, and a full picture is still elu­sive. More gran­u­lar data on pri­vate sec­tor cred­i­tor ex­po­sure may fa­cil­i­tate, in case of debt dis­tress, more ex­pe­di­ent cred­i­tor-debtor ne­go­ti­a­tions and al­low both cred­i­tors and gov­ern­ments to iden­tify which bonds are at risk of hold­out or lit­i­ga­tion tac­tics. An en­com­pass­ing trans­parency ini­tia­tive would in­clude, for in­stance, full dis­clo­sure on sov­er­eign bond own­er­ship as well as credit de­fault swaps that shift lender com­po­si­tion overnight. Know­ing the play­ers in­volved and the amounts owed would al­low the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity and the cit­i­zenry of af­fected coun­tries to better mon­i­tor how scarce re­sources in a time of cri­sis are be­ing de­ployed. The ac­counts for the coun­try it­self must be­come more com­pre­hen­sive, with im­proved data on do­mes­tic debt and debt owed by state-owned en­ter­prises. Ac­count­ing for pen­sion bur­dens is also in­creas­ingly im­por­tant, as re­cent debt work­outs in Detroit and Puerto Rico vividly il­lus­trate. Re­al­is­tic eco­nomic fore­casts that in­cor­po­rate down­side risks Re­al­is­tic growth fore­casts are crit­i­cal to avoid un­der­es­ti­mat­ing a coun­try’s neart­erm fi­nanc­ing needs and over­es­ti­mat­ing its ca­pac­ity to ser­vice its debt com­mit­ments. IMF his­to­rian James Boughton notes that dur­ing much of the 1980s debt cri­sis, overop­ti­mistic growth ex­pec­ta­tions per­sisted, es­pe­cially in Latin Amer­ica. Re­al­is­tic fore­casts, par­tic­u­larly recog­nis­ing the fragility of highly in­debted coun­tries, can speed res­o­lu­tion of any cri­sis. Ear­lier de­tec­tion of in­sol­vency and iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of cases in which large write-downs are nec­es­sary can­not guar­an­tee a faster res­o­lu­tion but are a step in that di­rec­tion. New leg­is­la­tion to sup­port or­derly sov­er­eign debt re­struc­tur­ings Le­gal steps in ju­ris­dic­tions that gov­ern in­ter­na­tional bonds (im­por­tantly but not ex­clu­sively New York and Lon­don) or where pay­ments are pro­cessed can con­trib­ute to more or­derly re­struc­tur­ing by pro­mot­ing a more level play­ing field be­tween sov­er­eign debtors and cred­i­tors. For in­stance, na­tional leg­is­la­tion can cap the amounts that may be re­claimed from de­faulted gov­ern­ment bonds bought at a deep dis­count. In 2010, the United King­dom en­acted such a law for coun­tries tak­ing part in the Heav­ily In­debted Poor Coun­tries (HIPC) debt re­lief ini­tia­tive, while Bel­gium in 2015 passed the so-called Anti–Vul­ture Funds Law, which pre­vents liti­gious cred­i­tors from dis­rupt­ing pay­ments made via Euro­clear. It would also en­er­gize leg­is­la­tion to fa­cil­i­tate a ma­jor­ity re­struc­tur­ings, which would al­low a sov­er­eign and a qual­i­fied ma­jor­ity of cred­i­tors to reach an agree­ment binding on all cred­i­tors sub­ject to the re­struc­tur­ings. The global pan­demic is a once-in-a-cen­tury shock that mer­its a gen­er­ous re­sponse from of­fi­cial and pri­vate cred­i­tors to­ward emerg­ing mar­ket and de­vel­op­ing economies, in­clud­ing pre­serv­ing the global trad­ing sys­tem and help­ing coun­tries weather debt prob­lems. Sup­port must be forth­com­ing, re­gard­less of what progress can be made in better man­ag­ing debt work­outs. How­ever, to make sure as much aid as pos­si­ble gets through to debtor coun­try cit­i­zens, it is es­sen­tial to en­sure in­ter-cred­i­tor eq­uity and fair bur­den shar­ing, es­pe­cially be­tween of­fi­cial and pri­vate cred­i­tors. The more of­fi­cial aid and soft loans can go to­ward help­ing needy cit­i­zens around the globe — and the less such as­sis­tance ends up as debt re­pay­ments to un­com­pro­mis­ing cred­i­tors — the better. — IMF.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170720,Why Sadc cot­ton farm­ers are har­vest­ing poverty and mis­ery,"SOME two decades ago, cot­ton farm­ing was a well­pay­ing job for Ms Jen­nifer Banda, a farmer from Sal­ima District on the shores of Lake Malawi, the third largest lake in Africa. Cot­ton farm­ing was a busi­ness she knew so well from child­hood. Farm­ers from around Sal­ima District, about 100km east of the cap­i­tal Li­longwe would af­ford to pay fees for their chil­dren and earn liveli­hoods from cot­ton grow­ing. Things have how­ever changed for Ms Banda, just like it has changed for many other cot­ton grow­ers in her coun­try. She claims that cot­ton grow­ers are now the poor­est of the poor in the so­ci­ety ow­ing to poor yields, fall­ing cot­ton prices and ram­pant ex­ploita­tion by pri­vate buy­ers and deal­ers. “I’ve been grow­ing cot­ton for years now and I haven’t ben­e­fited any­thing from the crop for the past decade or so,” she says in a cot­ton field near Chi­tala Re­search Sta­tion. “We’re dy­ing of hunger and our chil­dren can’t go to school. We’re get­ting noth­ing and it’s bad for our liveli­hoods.” Ms Banda says cot­ton grow­ers in her area are get­ting 100 Malaw­ian Kwacha per kg and yet the price is slightly over 300 Kwacha (around $0.40 per kg) at the fi­nal mar­ket in the cap­i­tal. “This year, I only man­aged to har­vest two bales of cot­ton from my plot which is close to a hectare. The bulk of my crop was de­stroyed by boll­worms,” the Sal­ima cot­ton grower says. Agri­cul­tural econ­o­mists in Malawi say vested in­ter­ests by lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional bro­kers sprin­kled with a lib­eral dose of pol­i­tics and opaque op­er­a­tions have all con­spired to frus­trate thou­sands of cot­ton grow­ers in the coun­try. Most cot­ton grow­ers in Malawi have given up on cot­ton farm­ing af­ter suf­fer­ing heavy losses from the cot­ton boll­worm and low prices. The height of suf­fer­ing and poverty among cot­ton grow­ers in Malawi is shown by the anger and protest shown by the farm­ers when they were in­ter­viewed re­cently by a group of jour­nal­ists drawn from across south­ern Africa who vis­ited Chi­tala Re­search Sta­tion where Bt Cot­ton tri­als are be­ing con­ducted. “I’ve noth­ing to show for grow­ing cot­ton,” says Mr Jerry Henox, a farmer from Kothe Vil­lage in Sal­ima District. “As a farmer, I’ve my own as­pi­ra­tions. I want to earn more from cot­ton grow­ing, I want to build my house, send chil­dren to school and buy pigs and goats for rearing. “But here I am, stuck in poverty. The cot­ton yields are poor and we’re be­ing ripped off by the Chi­nese buy­ers. I’ve noth­ing to show for my ef­forts.” Most farm­ers are aban­don­ing cot­ton grow­ing, while others have switched to grow­ing maize and drug crops in search of cash. Others have trekked to towns and cities in search of jobs. Num­bers of des­per­ate ru­ral job seek­ers are swelling the pe­riph­eries of the towns and cities in Malawi. The con­tin­u­ing slump in the price of cot­ton, one of south­ern Africa’s main cash crops, is spread­ing mis­ery across the re­gion. This sit­u­a­tion plays out in Zim­babwe, Swazi­land, Zam­bia and other coun­tries in the Sadc re­gion. In Malawi alone, cot­ton out­put has plum­meted from 100 000 met­ric tonnes in the 2012/13 sea­son to 49 000 met­ric tonnes in 2015. In the 2016 sea­son farm­ers only of­fered 13 000 met­ric tonnes against a de­mand of 250 000 met­ric tonnes. In Swazi­land too, cot­ton pro­duc­tion fell from a high of 171 000 met­ric tonnes to less than 44 000 met­ric tonnes af­ter 2009. Cot­ton pro­duc­tion in Zim­babwe has de­clined sharply over the years due to un­com­pet­i­tive prices, high in­put costs for farm­ers and other con­straints. Out­put fell from 283 000 tonnes in 2012 to less than 200 000 tonnes by 2013 be­fore it plunged to less than 200 000 tonnes in the three years that fol­lowed. At its peak, Zim­babwe pro­duced more than 353 000 tonnes, earn­ing the coun­try over $200 mil­lion. Cot­ton cre­ates em­ploy­ment for some 200 000 peo­ple. A glut of cot­ton prod­ucts from China and In­dia has weak­ened the cot­ton in­dus­trial sec­tor in most of the coun­tries in the re­gion. Since the late 1990s, the slid­ing of cot­ton prices has caused hard­ship for grow­ers on a scale unseen for three decades. Poor yields and re­turns have forced the Malawi gov­ern­ment to ex­plore new ways of how it could utilise emerg­ing agri­cul­tural biotech­nolo­gies to ad­dress the prob­lem. Malawi has moved from con­duct­ing con­fined biotech­nol­ogy cot­ton field tri­als to do­ing multi-lo­ca­tion tri­als in prepa­ra­tion for re­lease ap­provals. Biotech­nol­ogy ex­perts say ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied cot­ton is de­vel­oped us­ing bac­terium Bacil­lus thuringien­sis (Bt), which nat­u­rally pro­duces a chem­i­cal harm­ful only to a small frac­tion of in­sects such as the boll­worm. The Bt toxin is in­serted into cot­ton, caus­ing cot­ton called Bt cot­ton, to pro­duce this nat­u­ral in­sec­ti­cide in its tis­sues. Ex­perts say that cot­ton farm­ers in Zim­babwe, Malawi, Swazi­land, Mozam­bique and most other south­ern African coun­tries, can ef­fec­tively re­duce in­put costs and con­trol dam­age from boll­worms and other in­sects that fre­quently dam­age cot­ton by adopt­ing Bt cot­ton. They say cot­ton farm­ers in Africa suf­fer huge losses due to pest prob­lems. The most de­struc­tive of pests is the African boll­worm (Heli­cov­erpa armigera), which biotech ex­perts say in se­vere cases can cause a 100 per­cent loss while in un­pro­tected fields pest dam­age can be as high as 90 per­cent. “At present, the con­trol of boll­worms in this re­gion is done through ap­pli­ca­tion of pes­ti­cides, which is a costly ex­er­cise in terms of cost of pes­ti­cides, spray equip­ment, and labour,” says Mr Doc­tor Gondwe, a re­searcher at Chi­tala Re­search Sta­tion which is test­ing nine cot­ton va­ri­eties. “Bt cot­ton pro­vides us with a more ef­fec­tive and less costly way to con­trol dam­age from boll­worms and other in­sects that dam­age cot­ton. So far, the re­sults we’re get­ting from our tri­als are promis­ing. Farm­ers from around Sal­ima are im­pressed with the crop and will adopt it.” Mr Gondwe says boll­worms are the most de­struc­tive of pests and are bring­ing un­told mis­ery and poverty to cot­ton farm­ers. In­ter­na­tional Ser­vice for the Ac­qui­si­tion of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) AfriCen­tre di­rec­tor Ms Mar­garet Karembu told this writer that the adop­tion of agri­cul­tural biotech­nol­ogy has lagged be­hind in Africa com­pared to the rapid rates seen in the med­i­cal and health sec­tors. “Where are we as Africans? This is the ques­tion, we need to think se­ri­ously about the good work (on agri­cul­tural biotech­nol­ogy) go­ing on in our labs,” she says. “What is our place in the global biotech­nol­ogy space? We need to re­claim it and im­prove the liveli­hoods of our farm­ers across the con­ti­nent. “We think of our­selves as vic­tims of the tech­nol­ogy. The fact is that our pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions and uni­ver­si­ties have been do­ing re­search on biotech crops for years and this has not moved to the com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion stage,” she says. Ms Karembu says Africa needs to dif­fuse myths and mis­con­cep­tions around ge­net­i­cally mod­i­fied crops. “The me­dia has a big role to play in clear­ing some of the mis­con­cep­tions about biotech­nol­ogy and GMOs,” the ISAAA di­rec­tor says. “When me­dia de­monises the sci­ence, it be­comes dif­fi­cult to cor­rect the mis­takes. There’s a lot of un­fa­mil­iar­ity with the tech­nol­ogy and hav­ing fixed mind sets will not help our strug­gling farm­ers. “The farm­ers you saw in Sal­ima are poor and they’re strug­gling. Why should we block them from ac­cess­ing the Bt cot­ton va­ri­eties that can sig­nif­i­cantly boost their yields and in­come? Farm­ing shouldn’t be for leisure, it’s a busi­ness and it should be there to im­prove the qual­ity of liveli­hoods of the farm­ers,” says Ms Karembu. “Biotech­nol­ogy is one of the tools we can use to first of all im­prove crop yields and se­condly to sup­port Africa’s in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion goals for value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion.” Zim­babwe farmer rep­re­sen­ta­tives too, say the Gov­ern­ment must se­ri­ously con­sider the adop­tion of Bt cot­ton by farm­ers to re­vamp pro­duc­tion and re­vive the tex­tile and cloth­ing in­dus­try. “Our farm­ers are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing huge losses due to the boll­worm prob­lem. De­spite the fears that we have for biotech­nol­ogy, I think Zim­babwe as a coun­try needs to se­ri­ously con­sider Bt cot­ton to help farm­ers re­duce crop yield losses and en­hance their earn­ings,” says Mr Berean Muk­wende of the Zim­babwe Farm­ers Union (ZFU). “Malawi is show­ing us the way to go and we need to learn from them.” Some Zim­bab­wean cot­ton farm­ers who vis­ited Bt cot­ton trial fields in Malawi called on the Gov­ern­ment to adopt GM cot­ton to im­prove yields and earn­ings for farm­ers. Cot­ton pro­duc­tion has hit an all-time low in most Sadc coun­tries with farm­ers pro­duc­ing two bales per hectare com­pared to 10 or more per hectare in the past. “Farm­ers have been se­ri­ously dis­cour­aged to grow cot­ton in the coun­try be­cause of losses in­curred through boll worm in­fes­ta­tions and ex­ces­sive spray­ing costs,” says Mr Daniel Khu­malo, head of the Cot­ton Board of Swazi­land. He says there is a need for Swazi­land to con­sider grow­ing Bt cot­ton to boost pro­duc­tion and re­vive its tex­tile in­dus­try. World lead­ing cot­ton pro­duc­ing coun­tries such as In­dia, China, USA, Aus­tralia, Brazil, South Africa and Burk­ina Faso have adopted Bt cot­ton. More than 70 per­cent of cot­ton traded glob­ally is GM cot­ton. But, most Sadc coun­tries have adopted a pre­cau­tion­ary ap­proach to GM crops due to health and en­vi­ron­men­tal risk con­cerns. South Africa is one of the top 10 coun­tries plant­ing more than one mil­lion hectares in 2016 and con­tin­ued to lead the adop­tion of biotech crops on the African con­ti­nent. Kenya, Malawi and Nige­ria have tran­si­tioned from re­search to grant­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal re­lease ap­provals while six other coun­tries — Burk­ina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nige­ria, Swazi­land and Uganda made sig­nif­i­cant progress to­wards com­ple­tion of multi-lo­ca­tion tri­als in readi­ness for con­sid­er­ing com­mer­cial ap­proval, ISAAA re­ported. But the road to the adop­tion of Bt cot­ton tech­nolo­gies in south­ern Africa still faces stiff re­sis­tance de­spite the po­ten­tial it holds to a cot­ton sec­tor in con­tin­u­ous de­cline.",津巴布韦

zw,The Manica Post,20191025,Wa­ter cri­sis raises ugly head in Buhera:,"WA­TER cri­sis is one of the sever­est threats fac­ing Buhera, a ru­ral district al­ready rav­aged by hunger, poverty and dis­eases like HIV and AIDS and Tu­ber­cu­lo­sis. Buhera’s econ­omy is hinged on sub­sis­tence cul­ti­va­tion of mil­let, ground­nuts, round­nuts, sorghum along­side small live­stock and cat­tle ranch­ing. It is the dri­est re­gion in Man­i­ca­land where rain­fall is un­pre­dictable - the on­set of the rainy sea­son is fre­quently de­layed, mid-sea­son dry spells pro­tracted, some­times last­ing 30 to 50 days and the rains of­ten stop early be­fore crops reach ma­tu­rity. It has an av­er­age rain­fall be­low 500mm per year, mak­ing re­li­able sup­ply of wa­ter the miss­ing link in its de­vel­op­men­tal thrust. Wa­ter se­cu­rity helps to re­duce poverty, ad­vance ed­u­ca­tion, pro­duc­tiv­ity and liv­ing stan­dards. Buhera ex­pe­ri­ences hot sum­mers of be­tween 30 to 40 de­grees Cel­sius, mean­ing its pop­u­la­tion, es­ti­mated at 280 000, re­quires un­re­strained ac­cess to wa­ter. So bad is the sit­u­a­tion on the ground that women and girls travel long dis­tances to fetch wa­ter. Ma­jor rivers, in­clud­ing Save, have dried up. Live­stock scram­ble for the same wa­ter points with peo­ple. In some cases young chil­dren are al­legedly col­laps­ing as re­sult of de­hy­dra­tion. Though some home­steads have pri­vate wells and jojo tanks to store wa­ter, these dry up due to con­tin­u­ous ab­strac­tion. Some are dig­ging shal­low wells along dry riverbeds. Buhera Ru­ral District Coun­cil chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Dr Emily Chib­von­godze said the wa­ter sit­u­a­tion was dire. “The district is wa­ter stressed. Wa­ter scarcity is a ma­jor headache,” said Dr Chib­von­godze. She said short­age of wa­ter was di­rectly linked to lim­ited rains and high rate of evap­o­ra­tion which have left the district with a telling im­bal­ance be­tween dwin­dling sup­ply and in­creas­ing de­mand. Streams in the district are sea­sonal and dry for most of the year; putting to the fore the need to in­vest in ground wa­ter to sup­port do­mes­tic and pro­duc­tive needs of the com­mu­nity. Dr Chib­von­godze said there is need to con­struct new wa­ter sources - dams, weirs, deep wells and drilling bore­holes. “We have a pop­u­la­tion of about 280 300 peo­ple against 1306 wa­ter points. Nor­mally each wa­ter point should serve about 250 peo­ple. There im­bal­ance makes our sit­u­a­tion dire. We have ar­eas with­out bore­holes and peo­ple walk long dis­tances to ac­cess wa­ter,” she said. “Some bore­holes have wa­ter, but were de­com­mis­sioned af­ter be­ing con­tam­i­nated dur­ing Cyclone Idai. They are a write-off. China Aid has drilled some bore­holes and 485 were re­ha­bil­i­tated through the Wa­ter, San­i­ta­tion and Hy­giene (Wash) pro­gramme. Marowany­ati Dam is al­most com­plete, and more such in­ter­ven­tions are re­quired to save the sit­u­a­tion,” said Dr Chob­von­godze. She said UNICEF has funded a piped wa­ter scheme in Ward 19 where six vil­lages, com­pris­ing of 1601 house­holds, two schools, a clinic and dip tank are con­nected. The piped wa­ter scheme, she said, will be repli­cated in other wards funds per­mit­ting. “The vil­lages now en­joy safe piped wa­ter. Pre­vi­ously, they used to draw wa­ter from un­pro­tected sources along Nyazvidzi river. The vil­lages were fre­quently rav­aged by cholera prior to the in­ter­ven­tion,” she said. But the district’s rivers - the big­ger source of wa­ter - are fast dry­ing up. Save river dried up in Au­gust. Its ecosys­tem and bio­di­ver­sity are un­der threat due to ex­ces­sive hu­man in­ter­fer­ence. The rem­nant forests along it also in dan­ger, as trees are cut in­dis­crim­i­nately to ob­tain wood for fuel. In light of the sea­son­al­ity of these heav­ily silted rivers, ground­wa­ter be­comes the main source of wa­ter for do­mes­tic and agri­cul­tural use. Mrs Bran­d­ina Dhege, 46, of Zvavashe vil­lage, said the un­re­li­able wa­ter sit­u­a­tion was brew­ing con­flicts among vil­lagers, es­pe­cially in the Hande area. “They do not want to see us (strangers) fetch­ing wa­ter there. That bore­hole be­longs to the school and a few from that vil­lage. We are not wanted near it. We are re­garded as out­siders and they chase and ac­cuse us of de­plet­ing their wa­ter,” said Mrs Dhege. “Nearby wa­ter sources are closely guarded by their com­mu­ni­ties. Peo­ple are fight­ing over the lit­tle avail­able wa­ter points, even in ir­ri­ga­tion schemes.” Hande river dried up in June and Mrs Dhega and other women use hoes and shov­els to dig the riverbed in search of wa­ter trapped deep in the sand. “There are no bore­holes in Zvinavashe vil­lage. I have been fetch­ing wa­ter from this river from my child­hood. At 46, I am still fetch­ing wa­ter from the same river, mean­ing my vil­lage has not de­vel­oped. Wa­ter is a ba­sic ne­ces­sity of life, and it is not pleas­ing at all. This wa­ter is not safe for drink­ing, but what can we do? We have no op­tion, but drink it. This area is very hot with tem­per­a­tures as high as 40 de­grees Cel­sius. This de­mands that we drink a lot of wa­ter,” she said. Miss Ther­essa Mah­wite (20), of Zvinavashe vil­lage, said the pres­sure on wa­ter re­sources goes hand-in-hand with de­te­ri­o­rat­ing qual­ity. Lack of clean wa­ter, she said, is a plague af­fect­ing thou­sands of folks in the district, who have to fight wa­ter borne dis­eases aris­ing from it. “We sur­vive on un­clean wa­ter, never mind the as­so­ci­ated dan­gers. We are be­tween a hard rock and hard sur­face. If we don’t drink, we die of de­hy­dra­tion and if we drink from un­pro­tected sources we get dis­eases. We are in dire need of help,” she said. A joint re­port ti­tled: Pro­file of Save Sub-catch­ment in Buhera District by Ox­fam, UNDP and Govern­ment col­lab­o­rate such fears: “How­ever, in years with be­low av­er­age rain­fall most streams dry up by April. Ground­wa­ter, which is the main source of drink­ing wa­ter in wards 25, 28 and 30 of Buhera District is char­ac­terised by high lev­els of tur­bid­ity. High tur­bid­ity in ground­wa­ter has neg­a­tive im­pli­ca­tions for hu­man health con­sid­er­ing that pathogens such as bac­te­ria, viruses and pro­to­zoa typ­i­cally at­tach to par­tic­u­lates. Sev­eral of the 28 wa­ter sam­ples from wards 25 and 28 tested pos­i­tive for salin­ity. 47 per­cent of ground­wa­ter sam­ples, in­clud­ing from bore­holes, as well as un­pro­tected shal­low and deep wells in the three wards tested pos­i­tive for fae­cal co­l­iform bac­te­ria.” From the 1980s on­wards, there were more drought than wet years, with the high­est fre­quency in the 1990s, lead­ing to se­vere short­age of wa­ter for hu­mans and live­stock, crops and an­i­mals in the district. This is at­trib­uted to the El Nino weather pat­terns and cli­mate change that give rise to harsher and more fre­quent droughts in the re­gion. Sci­en­tists pre­dict that as tem­per­a­tures con­tinue to rise with global warm­ing and pop­u­la­tions keep on grow­ing, the district will ex­pe­ri­ence harsher wa­ter short­ages - and will need to find clever so­lu­tions to en­sure there is enough wa­ter for its in­hab­i­tants.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20160207,Lever­ag­ing Value Added Ex­ports for Sus­tain­able Eco­nomic Growth,"ZIM­BABWE’s econ­omy de­pends heav­ily on its min­ing and agri­cul­ture sec­tors com­mod­ity ex­ports. Fol­low­ing a decade of con­trac­tion from 1998 to 2008, the econ­omy recorded real growth of more than 10 per­cent per year from 2010 to 2013, due to the im­me­di­ate stabilising ef­fect of dol­lar­i­sa­tion or multi-cur­rency regime be­fore slow­ing down to about three per­cent in 2014 due to poor har­vests, low di­a­mond rev­enues, and de­creased do­mes­tic and for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. Lack of pru­dent man­age­ment of the sup­ply side of the multi-cur­rency regime, in­fra­struc­ture and reg­u­la­tory de­fi­cien­cies, a poor in­vest­ment cli­mate, a large sov­er­eign debt bur­den, and the ex­tremely high Govern­ment wage bill im­pede the coun­try’s eco­nomic per­for­mance. Within the decade of con­trac­tion un­til early 2009, the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe al­legedly rou­tinely printed money to fund the bud­get deficit, fu­el­ing hyper­in­fla­tion in the process. Dol­lar­i­sa­tion or adop­tion of mul­ti­c­ur­rency regime in early 2009 — which of­fi­cialised the use of cur­ren­cies such as the Botswana pula, the South African rand, and the US dol­lar — ended hyper­in­fla­tion and re­duced in­fla­tion below 10 per­cent per year. The econ­omy has failed to grow as an­tic­i­pated mainly be­cause of the struc­tural phe­nom­e­nal prob­lem of be­ing com­mod­ity) ex­port based (pri­mary prod­ucts), than be­ing value added ex­port based or driven (sec­ondary prod­ucts). Fail­ure to de­velop a strong foothold out­side Sadc Dol­lar­i­sa­tion or multi-cur­rency regime com­par­a­tively placed Zim­babwe in a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage over its trad­ing part­ners within the Sadc re­gion. Zim­babwe could have taken ad­van­tage to de­velop a strong foothold out­side Sadc. How­ever, an­other his­tor­i­cal Achilles for Zim­babwe, which per­sists to this day, has been the in­abil­ity of ex­ports to ex­pand be­yond the Sadc re­gion. There isn’t much to Zim­babwe’s in­ter­na­tional trade per­for­mance once we re­move some of its big­gest trad­ing part­ners such as South Africa and Mozam­bique. Sus­tained ex­port suc­cess re­quires that Zim­bab­wean ex­porters be able to ex­tend their in­ter­na­tional foot­print to cul­tur­ally and phys­i­cally dis­tant mar­kets, tar­get­ing th­ese mar­kets not only with com­modi­ties, but also in­creased lev­els of value-added prod­ucts. It is clear that heavy re­liance on com­mod­ity ex­ports has not been sus­tain­able. Zim­stat’s trends are that ex­ports de­creased to $231,63 mil­lion in De­cem­ber from $411,53 mil­lion in Novem­ber of 2014, while they have been av­er­ag­ing $926,88 mil­lion from 1993 un­til 2014, reach­ing an all-time high of $3 557,03 mil­lion in De­cem­ber of 2011 and a record low of $156,41 mil­lion in March of 2014. The chal­lenges of com­mod­ity de­pen­dent ex­ports and in­ter­na­tional com­mod­ity prices. Since low-in­come coun­tries like Zim­babwe and other de­vel­op­ing coun­tries de­pend mostly on just a few com­modi­ties for the bulk share of their ex­port earn­ings, com­mod­ity price fluc­tu­a­tions di­rectly af­fect the in­ci­dence of poverty, as the vast ma­jor­ity of the poor de­pend on pri­mary com­modi­ties for their liveli­hoods. The un­cer­tainty gen­er­ated from com­mod­ity price fluc­tu­a­tions or volatil­ity ham­pers eco­nomic growth and is as­so­ci­ated with in­creases in poverty. Lit­er­a­ture sug­gest that, the cor­re­la­tion be­tween changes in com­mod­ity prices and eco­nomic growth is over­whelm­ing. For ex­am­ple, ex­am­in­ing eco­nomic growth rates for de­vel­op­ing economies against the an­nual rate of change of com­mod­ity prices for the pe­riod 1995–2009 finds an 87 per­cent cor­re­la­tion be­tween the two vari­ables. It is gen­er­ally ac­knowl­edged that a key rea­son for ex­ces­sive price volatil­ity of pri­mary com­modi­ties is the in­elas­tic na­ture of sup­ply and de­mand of such com­modi­ties. In agri­cul­ture, for in­stance, pro­duc­tion can be dif­fi­cult to ad­just, since plant­ing and plan­ning de­ci­sions must be made far in ad­vance of phys­i­cal pur­chases. Thus, sit­u­a­tions of over­sup­ply can last for a long time, while it can be dif­fi­cult to boost pro­duc­tion in the case of short­ages. Hence, it is im­por­tant for th­ese coun­tries, Zim­babwe in­cluded, to re­duce their de­pen­dence on pri­mary com­modi­ties and adopt poli­cies for eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and value added ex­port gen­er­a­tion. In this con­text, poli­cies and mea­sures that fo­cus on both price and rev­enue (in­come) sta­bil­i­sa­tion will be crit­i­cal. Lever­ag­ing Value Added En­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion Ex­por­ta­tion of raw agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties and min­ing com­modi­ties has added to the neg­a­tive im­pact on the so­cio-econ­omy of the coun­try; jobs are ex­ported and po­ten­tial rev­enues are lost to those na­tions that have em­braced in­no­va­tion and value ad­di­tion as a pri­or­ity in their man­u­fac­tur­ing mod­els. Our agri­cul­tural and min­ing sec­tors — have a po­ten­tial for au­ton­o­mous growth and there­fore the need to lev­er­age on th­ese sec­tors is key to re­viv­ing the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy. A lot of value has been lost in th­ese com­modi­ties sec­tors due to ex­por­ta­tion of raw as well as semi-pro­cessed prod­ucts. Very lit­tle is hap­pen­ing in as far as value ad­di­tion of our com­modi­ties de­spite the known po­ten­tial and im­pact of value ad­di­tion on job cre­ation and eco­nomic growth. The re­al­i­sa­tion of Value Added Ex­ports hinges on the strate­gies to pro­mote en­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion. This en­tails con­certed ac­tions by Govern­ment, the cor­po­rate sec­tor, and the fi­nan­cial sec­tor. What can the Govern­ment do? This week’s eco­nomic fo­cus sug­gests four ba­sic ini­tia­tives: to pur­sue a bal­anced strat­egy, to cre­ate the right in­cen­tives, to build the ca­pac­ity of the pri­vate sec­tor, and to strengthen the ecosys­tem for the Ven­ture Cap­i­tal In­dus­try. The most lead­ing Sadc Ex­porter-South Africa re­mains a net man­u­fac­tured prod­ucts (value added) ex­ports earner, be­cause of its less de­pen­dence on com­mod­ity ex­ports. China, in its quest for eco­nomic growth has em­barked on En­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion within its do­mes­tic arena. This strat­egy has been key to the sus­tain­abil­ity of the eco­nomic growth model that China has fol­lowed over the past decades. A trans­for­ma­tion of eco­nomic growth strat­egy to­wards one that is more solidly based on ef­fi­ciency and knowl­edge is widely recog­nised as es­sen­tial to Zim­babwe’s long-term pros­per­ity as well. This trans­for­ma­tion should be at the cen­tre of the Zim­bab­wean Govern­ment’s “sci­en­tific de­vel­op­ment strat­egy.” In con­clu­sion, for Zim­babwe to move away from its struc­tural com­modi­ties based and driven ex­port econ­omy to a Value Added prod­ucts driven one re­quires en­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion model. An 80 per­cent com­modi­ties based ex­port earn­ings is highly risky. Al­ready the pro­jected agri­cul­tural per­for­mance of the econ­omy in the 2016 Na­tional bud­get has been se­ri­ously hand­i­capped by the poor rains this sea­son and lack of ad­e­quate prepa­ra­tions for plough­ing and plant­ing. Com­modi­ties are sus­cep­ti­ble and vul­ner­a­ble to weather con­di­tions and volatile com­mod­ity prices in the In­ter­na­tional mar­ket. Com­modi­ties ex­port­ing coun­tries like Zim­babwe have no con­trol over the com­mod­ity prices. An en­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion eco­nomic re­form to boost Value Ad­di­tion on our com­modi­ties would go along way to­wards mit­i­gat­ing the chal­lenges of com­mod­ity de­pen­dent ex­ports and in­ter­na­tional com­mod­ity prices volatil­ity, and en­hance real eco­nomic re­vival and sus­tained growth.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20200904,"Pol­i­tics, eco­nomics: What can we do about them?","ED­DIE Cross has just writ­ten an ar­ti­cle about his tele­phone con­ver­sa­tion with some­one in the United Kingdom. They pointed out that they could not do any­thing about pol­i­tics in the coun­try, but could do some­thing about eco­nomics. This is a view shared by many Zim­bab­weans. This is par­tially but not wholly true. Why do we hold such a neg­a­tive view about pol­i­tics? It is im­por­tant for us to ex­am­ine what we mean by pol­i­tics and what we mean by eco­nomics. The Lan­caster House con­sti­tu­tion de­fined pol­i­tics for us. We largely ac­cepted this def­i­ni­tion. For­mer pres­i­dent Robert Mugabe, as the chief politi­cian and po­lit­i­cal the­o­rist for 40 years af­ter In­de­pen­dence, added some of his own views to the in­her­ited def­i­ni­tion. His views were typ­i­cally Machi­avel­lian: he stated clearly that only politi­cians could say or do any­thing on pol­i­tics, and that for them there were no ap­pli­ca­ble le­gal or moral rules and reg­u­la­tions. He in­her­ited the use of vi­o­lence, tor­ture and killings of po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents from the Rhode­sians. For the Rhode­sian gov­ern­ment, pol­i­tics was an area where any­thing was per­mit­ted, as long they en­abled you to re­tain power. Zanu PF in­her­ited these Rhode­sian sys­tems, and prac­tices them. Most of the po­lice and judges obeyed these rules. It is es­sen­tial for all Zim­bab­weans to in­ter­ro­gate these def­i­ni­tions of pol­i­tics, as well as the closely re­lated is­sue of eco­nomics. We show weak­ness in blindly ac­cept­ing def­i­ni­tions that lead us to poverty and desti­tu­tion. We need to think through what we have in­her­ited, in­stead of blindly em­u­lat­ing them. The Lan­caster House agree­ment was de­signed to give po­lit­i­cal power to Africans through one day of elec­tions ev­ery five years. This was de­fined as “democ­racy”, with the de­tails enun­ci­ated through the Lan­caster con­sti­tu­tion. The other Lan­caster agree­ment aim was to en­sure that the wealth of the coun­try — the econ­omy — re­mained in the hands of Euro­pean set­tlers and for­eign com­pa­nies. This re­mained the case for the first two decades of In­de­pen­dence. When we tried to change it, we tried to do it through the Eco­nomic Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­gramme (Esap) and the Fast-Track Land Re­set­tle­ment (FTLR) Pro­gramme. Esap was im­posed by out­siders; FTLR was the brain­child of Mugabe, and lacked tech­ni­cal, pro­fes­sional and fi­nan­cial sup­port. It also lacked leg­isla­tive ad­her­ence. De­spite these se­ri­ous weak­nesses, Zim­babwe em­braced these poli­cies. We need first of all to de­fine pol­i­tics. Pol­i­tics is de­fined as a sci­ence and an art about how to man­age and rule a coun­try. There are al­most 200 coun­tries in the world and each of them has a dif­fer­ent for­mu­la­tion of “pol­i­tics”. It can­not be con­fined to one day of elec­tions ev­ery five years. It is meant to pro­vide Zim­bab­weans with the means to lead a good life, through choos­ing the best lead­ers to achieve this fun­da­men­tal hu­man right. Un­for­tu­nately, we have not de­fined what con­sti­tutes “a good life”. In the 1980s, we un­der­stood it to mean ed­u­ca­tion, health care and a clean wa­ter sup­ply for all, but some­how we could not main­tain these ser­vices. Why and how did they de­te­ri­o­rate? We can put some blame on the elected lead­er­ship, i.e. par­lia­ment and cab­i­net. We can also blame the un­elected civil ser­vice, as it be­came filled with po­lit­i­cal sup­port­ers. They are grossly un­der-paid and do not earn enough to own a house, a car or to buy suf­fi­cient ba­sic foods. One rea­son is that the num­ber of gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees has dou­bled in the last 20 years, but the econ­omy has not dou­bled. In fact, it has shrunk and is still shrink­ing. Why is this elec­toral sys­tem dys­func­tional? To get elected, you need money, so those with money win elec­tions. When they win, they are able to gain more money and prop­erty through pa­tron­age, i.e. those in power can give you land and con­tracts. It is es­sen­tial that we look at the re­quire­ments for the selec­tion of par­lia­men­tar­i­ans and min­is­ters, to en­sure that they have the qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ence to do the job prop­erly. Most of the work re­quired to­day de­pends on en­gi­neer­ing, yet few if any of our politi­cians know much about en­gi­neer­ing. The whole area of gov­er­nance de­pends on how we cre­ate more wealth and how we utilise this wealth, eco­nomics, yet we have very few econ­o­mists and busi­ness per­son­nel amongst politi­cians. It is time we looked at the qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ence of de­ci­sion-mak­ers, and take steps to en­sure we get the best politi­cians as well as civil ser­vants who do the job on our be­half. Why can­not the en­gi­neer­ing as­so­ci­a­tion elect two en­gi­neers for the Se­nate? Why can­not the eco­nomics as­so­ci­a­tion elect two econ­o­mists for the Se­nate? This would democra­tise the Se­nate and pro­vide bet­ter ex­per­tise in these crit­i­cally im­por­tant ar­eas. What about eco­nomics? I think ev­ery­body will agree that the econ­omy is not run­ning very well. Why not? One rea­son is that the gov­ern­ment em­ploys so many per­son­nel that they of­ten spend 95% of the bud­get on salaries, yet these civil ser­vants are badly paid. There are 550 000 civil ser­vants, out of 816 000 peo­ple em­ployed in the for­mal econ­omy. Around 67,4% of for­mal econ­omy em­ploy­ees are gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees! Then who is re­spon­si­ble for cre­at­ing wealth? Gov­ern­ment is very im­por­tant, but we also des­per­ately need many more farm­ers, in­dus­trial work­ers and com­pa­nies work­ing to cre­ate wealth in both the for­mal and the in­for­mal econ­omy. The econ­omy is what cre­ates wealth. An­other rea­son is gov­ern­ment spends so much of the bud­get on em­ploy­ing peo­ple who do not have the tools, ma­te­ri­als, trans­port and in­fra­struc­ture to do their jobs prop­erly. An­other rea­son is the con­stant print­ing of money to sat­isfy gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees who in­vari­ably go on strike for more pay. But, of course, print­ing money — whether it is paper money or Trea­sury Bills (TBs) — does not nec­es­sar­ily cre­ate wealth. More ju­di­cious mone­tary ex­pan­sion is needed. Mone­tary ex­pan­sion is clearly one of the most im­por­tant re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of gov­ern­ment. But the in­creased TBs should be tar­geted at eco­nomic ex­pan­sion. It is time that all those empty fac­to­ries in Harare and Bu­l­awayo are utilised to pro­duce the goods needed in this coun­try, such as small and lower-cost trac­tors. If the two mil­lion small-scale farm­ers could mech­a­nise their farm­ing, their pro­duc­tiv­ity could dou­ble. Last but not least, 5,7 mil­lion peo­ple are em­ployed in the non-for­mal econ­omy, and they have re­ceived lit­tle from gov­ern­ment to im­prove the quan­tity and qual­ity of their prod­ucts. They presently pro­duce most of the ma­te­ri­als for the con­struc­tion in­dus­try: what about pro­vid­ing more train­ing and qual­ity su­per­vi­sion for the in­for­mal econ­omy? What about bridg­ing the gap be­tween the for­mal and in­for­mal economies, so that they can share their strengths? This will cer­tainly in­crease the qual­ity and ex­port po­ten­tial of the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries. In­vest­ment into the econ­omy can be dou­bled by in­volv­ing the di­as­pora in the econ­omy: for ev­ery US$100 mil­lion pro­vided by the di­as­pora in in­vest­ment of their choice, gov­ern­ment can com­ple­ment by adding an­other US$100 mil­lion. This has been done suc­cess­fully by coun­tries as di­verse as China and Ethiopia. A com­pe­tent gov­ern­ment can give a big boost to the econ­omy. The econ­omy can grow with­out gov­ern­ment: it is al­ready do­ing so. But gov­ern­ment can im­prove its per­for­mance by tar­get­ing in­vest­ment both by gov­ern­ment and by the pri­vate sec­tor, par­tic­u­larly the agri­cul­ture and the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries. Both of these will cre­ate enor­mous em­ploy­ment growth and eco­nomic wealth.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200803,Farewell to four African he­roes in the last week of July 2020,"LAST week was the week of He­roes in Africa and the di­as­pora, with the death of four men who made a dif­fer­ence. They fought for free­dom and stood large in their dif­fer­ent places, all were vi­sion­ar­ies who were in­spired by an ear­lier gener ation of vi­sion­ary men­tors, and will be re­mem­bered for their hon­esty, dig­nity and de­ter­mi­na­tion. They span three gen­er­a­tions. All four were still very ac­tive in mak­ing their so­ci­eties a bet­ter place, and all were role mod­els for their peers and oth­ers. All four passed away in the last days of July 2020. Th­ese he­roes were quiet, prin­ci­pled peo­ple who spoke their mind and learned to speak bluntly in a quiet voice, so peo­ple lis­tened. They fought for hu­man rights and democ­racy, and against racial seg­re­ga­tion and op­pres­sion. And all of th­ese are role mod­els who should have a place of pride in our his­tory books. Ben­jamin Mkapa Ben­jamin Wil­liam Mkapa, third Pres­i­dent of the United Repub­lic of Tan­za­nia and stu­dent of Julius Ny­erere. When he died on 23 July at age 81, his peers eu­lo­gised him as a ded­i­cated builder of African unity and re­gional in­te­gra­tion, and a peace­maker. He of­ten quoted his men­tor in urg­ing the youth of Africa and the di­as­pora to take on im­pos­si­ble tasks, and to run while oth­ers walk, say­ing, “It can be done, play your part.” His gen­er­a­tion did it, ded­i­cat­ing their lives to lib­er­a­tion and in­de­pen­dence. He was a young boy born in south­ern Tan­za­nia, who grew up in a colo­nial state, left to earn a de­gree in English lit­er­a­ture and re­turned home to be­come a jour­nal­ist, am­bas­sador, cab­i­net min­is­ter and Pres­i­dent. He be­lieved pas­sion­ately in African unity and in­te­gra­tion, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and peace. And he showed us how it can be done. He was cho­sen by his party Chama Cha Mapin­duzi (CCM) to con­test the Pres­i­dency in 1995, which he won hand­ily, and served two terms, in­creas­ing his pop­u­lar sup­port in the elec­tion for his se­cond term in 2000. He fo­cused mainly on re­or­gan­is­ing and lib­er­al­is­ing the econ­omy to func­tion more ef­fi­ciently, but was also the first Pres­i­dent to work with a post-colo­nial and post-apartheid con­ti­nent of Africa. He de­scribed good lead­er­ship as “a leader who wants to serve, rather than be served.” The last line of Mkapa’s mem­oirs, pub­lished last year, says, “I will leave it to my God and you to de­cide what dif­fer­ence I have made in this world.” Per­rance Shiri An­other hero who was shaped by Julius Ny­erere’s Tan­za­nia and Samora Machel’s Mozam­bique, was Per­rance Shiri, Air Chief Mar­shall (Rtd) and Zim­babwe’s Min­is­ter of Lands, Agri­cul­ture, Wa­ter and Ru­ral Re­set­tle­ment, and a top com­man­der of the lib­er­a­tion war. He was also a leader who served and who worked hard to achieve the goals he had fought for. He trained in Tan­za­nia and then he trained oth­ers who be­came com­man­ders them­selves, at Mga­gao. He was a mem­ber of the mil­i­tary High Com­mand of the Zim­babwe African Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion Army (ZANLA) and com­man­der of the north-east op­er­a­tional area known as Tete Prov­ince. Per­rance Shiri, who died on 29 July, was a free­dom fighter, air force com­man­der, min­is­ter and farmer, and also a me­di­a­tor. He was in­volved in build­ing the new Air Force of Zim­babwe. Hav­ing aban­doned his stud­ies to join the war of lib­er­a­tion, he used every op­por­tu­nity to study, un­til he achieved two Masters de­grees while con­tin­u­ing to un­der­take na­tional du­ties. Shiri fought for the lib­er­a­tion of his coun­try and won, as a re­spected guer­rilla com­man­der un­der Gen­eral Josiah Ton­gog­ara, in the fight for land and ed­u­ca­tion, in­still­ing the same lib­er­a­tion val­ues. His most re­cent achieve­ments of many were in land, wa­ter and food se­cu­rity, and the last one was for­malised on the day that he passed, when an agree­ment was signed by gov­ern­ment with the white com­mer­cial farm­ers for com­pen­sa­tion for im­prove­ments, a mile­stone in re-en­gage­ment, bring­ing clo­sure to this as­pect of the land re­form. The Zim­babwe Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion War Veter­ans As­so­ci­a­tion said Shiri was “an ex­cep­tional war strate­gist” who trained the young guer­rilla fighters who moved un­no­ticed into then Sal­is­bury and fired rock­ets into the oil stor­age tanks in the Souther­ton In­dus­trial Zone, caus­ing them to burn for sev­eral days, mark­ing a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone in the lib­er­a­tion war. Per­rance Shiri was the youngest of th­ese four he­roes, at 65. An­drew Mlan­geni A lit­tle fur­ther south, South Africans were bury­ing an­other hero who fought for free­dom and against apartheid. An­drew Mokete Mlan­geni, at age 95 was the last liv­ing mem­ber of the Rivo­nia tri­al­ists in­clud­ing Nel­son Man­dela and oth­ers, who ded­i­cated their youth to fight against apartheid and for jus­tice, spent al­most 30 years of their prime im­pris­oned on Robben Is­land, and then con­tin­ued to be ac­tive on their re­lease. Mlan­geni, like the other three, is a hero for Africans and the world, and a role model for hon­esty and com­mit­ment. He was born in the Free State and grew up in South West Town (Soweto), Jo­han­nes­burg, where he got his first job as a bus driver. He joined the African Na­tional Congress (ANC) start­ing with the Youth League, and was a branch del­e­gate to the fa­mous Congress of the Peo­ple that ap­proved the Free­dom Char­ter. He be­came a jour­nal­ist, and was among the first ANC cadres to go for mil­i­tary train­ing in China. On his re­turn, fol­low­ing a po­lice raid on Lil­liesleaf Farm at Rivo­nia, he was charged with sab­o­tage and con­spir­acy at the time when most of the uMkhonto weSizwe High Com­mand were ar­rested. Eight of the Rivo­nia tri­al­ists were sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment and Mlan­geni spent 27 years on Robben Is­land. Soon af­ter his re­lease, he was elected a Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment in the new South Africa where he served for 15 years be­fore re­tir­ing and con­tin­u­ing to ad­vo­cate for jus­tice and peace. He died in Tsh­wane on 21 July. John Robert Lewis The fourth free­dom fighter is John Robert Lewis, a serv­ing United States Con­gress­man born into poverty in the south­ern state of Alabama dur­ing the height of racial seg­re­ga­tion and op­pres­sion, who cam­paigned for civil rights with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He was one of the young ac­tivists who tested the strict and vi­o­lent seg­re­ga­tion in the south by go­ing into re­stricted ar­eas, in­clud­ing buses, press­ing for vot­ing rights at a time when vot­ing in the US was for whites only, a demo­cratic right won by black vot­ers in 1968. Leader of the march across the Ed­mund Pet­tus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, to the State capi­tol Mont­gomery at the age of 25, he was se­ri­ously beaten by state troop­ers in a vi­o­lent con­fronta­tion known as Bloody Sun­day. Although still a youth, he helped to or­gan­ise the march on Washington, when King made his fa­mous speech, “I have a dream… that my four lit­tle chil­dren will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the con­tent of their char­ac­ter.” He was first elected to the US Congress in 1986 and was re-elected 16 times rep­re­sent­ing At­lanta, Ge­or­gia, and de­scribed as “At­lanta’s ser­vant leader”. He died on 17 July at age 80 and was the first black law­maker to lie in state in the US Capi­tol Ro­tunda. The eu­logy at Ebenezer Bap­tist Church in At­lanta was de­liv­ered by for­mer US Pres­i­dent Bar­rack Obama. In at­ten­dance were four for­mer US Pres­i­dents. The web­site of the Na­tional Mu­seum of African Amer­i­can His­tory and Cul­ture said sim­ply, “Thank You, Rep. John Lewis”. So we will add: Thank You, Air Chief Mar­shal Per­rance Shiri. Thank You, An­drew Mlan­geni. And Asante Sana Sana, Ben­jamin W. Mkapa. sardc.net",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20200729,Mr Pres­i­dent: Are you not kick­ing the can down the road?,"DEAR Pres­i­dent ED Mnan­gagwa, Your Ex­cel­lency, I hope I find you well. The po­lit­i­cal script play­ing out in Zim­babwe is quite fa­mil­iar not only to me, but many other cit­i­zens now fed up with the never end­ing eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal crises. Zim­babwe marked a mile­stone 40 years since the re­moval of the colo­nial yoke, but you and I will agree that nearly half if not more of those years have been lost to po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic crises with lit­tle if any fo­cus on na­tional devel­op­ment. You said so in one of your trips to China as Vice-Pres­i­dent that Zim­babwe had lost nearly 20 years in which much could have been achieved. Upon your re­turn from the short ex­ile in Novem­ber to De­cem­ber 2017, you spoke greatly at the Zanu PF HQ about your vi­sion. Do you still have those notes your Ex­cel­lency so that they can re­mind you of what you set out to do? Amid some hope in 2017, I saw a man re­lieved of the bur­den of liv­ing out­side Zim­babwe at such an ad­vanced age, and a man haunted by the events of the past few weeks. This fear that you had your Ex­cel­lency is what the or­di­nary cit­i­zen has ex­pe­ri­enced for much of the time un­der Zanu PF and un­for­tu­nately wors­en­ing un­der your cur­rent lead­er­ship. The 2017 speech brought out the best in your hu­man­ity which un­for­tu­nately has been eroded by events from 2018 to date, most no­table be­ing the 2018 and 2019 shoot­ing of civil­ians which your act­ing party spokesper­son Pa­trick Chi­na­masa wore as a badge of hon­our, a few weeks back, threat­en­ing more of the same should cit­i­zens dare to chal­lenge your gov­ern­ment on the streets. The 2018 and 2019 shoot­ings which your gov­ern­ment brushed off, the many ab­duc­tions that have taken place over the years which your bu­reau­crats blame on the op­po­si­tion and so-called third force have all the hall­marks of a man who has a short mem­ory, hounded by Mu­gabe, only to re­turn and pick from where Mu­gabe left. Have you re­flected on the events of the past few months in which your gov­ern­ment had po­lit­i­cal ri­vals ab­ducted, and tor­tured in­clud­ing an MP Joanah Mamombe, coun­cil­lors and hun­dreds of young peo­ple are in prison for ex­er­cis­ing their right to protest. Have you re­flected on what is the end game of all this ten­sion and whether your vi­sion of a mid­dle in­come coun­try can be achieved un­der such chaos? In re­flect­ing on th­ese is­sues, your Ex­cel­lency, what im­age comes into your mind more-so how dif­fer­ent is your gov­ern­ment from that of the late for­mer Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe? Let us go back to his­tory a bit and look at the an­i­mos­ity between Mu­gabe and the late MDC leader Mor­gan Ts­van­gi­rai and how the whole Zanu PF and State ma­chin­ery re­sisted the op­po­si­tion with nu­mer­ous op­po­si­tion peo­ple be­ing killed, crit­i­cal news­pa­pers bombed and jour­nal­ists ar­rested and oth­ers ex­iled, the vi­o­lence that pre­ceded every elec­tion from 2000 to 2008 and fi­nally the rul­ing party con­ced­ing to a new Con­sti­tu­tion, a gov­ern­ment of na­tional unity and some rel­a­tive but short-lived peace and pros­per­ity up to 2013. Can you imag­ine your Ex­cel­lency how life would be in Zim­babwe if Mu­gabe and Zanu PF had been more civil in ac­com­mo­dat­ing the op­po­si­tion, con­ced­ing de­feat where you lost, al­low­ing more civilised and in­clu­sive po­lit­i­cal de­bate? Have you ever imagined your Ex­cel­lency how Zim­babwe would have been had Zanu PF not de­clared war on the op­po­si­tion since 2000, lead­ing to the os­traci­sa­tion that still be­dev­ils your gov­ern­ment to date. Zim­babwe has lost much, in fact we have gen­er­a­tion upon gen­er­a­tion of young peo­ple who have never known nor­malcy be it in terms of ed­u­ca­tion, health, em­ploy­ment, ac­cess to hous­ing among other hu­man needs. The suf­fer­ing of the ma­jor­ity of your peo­ple, with nearly half the pop­u­la­tion in need of food aid points to fail­ure your Ex­cel­lency. Power and dom­i­nance over an im­pov­er­ished and fear­ful peo­ple is lead­er­ship fail­ure. By per­pet­u­ally re­ly­ing on force to have your way, threat­en­ing cit­i­zens and the op­po­si­tion, you have not only cre­ated a huge prison called Zim­babwe, but you also have be­come a pris­oner of the po­lit­i­cal cir­cum­stances you con­tinue to abet. This is be­com­ing the legacy of what your gov­ern­ment calls the sec­ond repub­lic, but seem­ingly a con­tin­u­a­tion and a worse ver­sion of the record of the lead­er­ship of Robert Mu­gabe. Just as Mu­gabe had his po­lit­i­cal nemesis in Ts­van­gi­rai, you now have your own in Nel­son Chamisa. I am sure you agree with me Your Ex­cel­lency that po­lit­i­cal rel­e­vance is not de­rived from be­ing ac­com­mo­dated by po­lit­i­cal nonen­ti­ties such as Love­more Mad­huku, Brian Muteki and Thokozani Khupe among oth­ers who make up the Po­lit­i­cal Ac­tors Di­a­logue (Po­lad) plat­form that you cre­ated. It is to all in­tents and pur­poses an arm of your gov­ern­ment with no iota of re­spect be­yond the walls of State House. I could as well speak the truth that you equally have no re­spect for the group­ing called Po­lad that reg­u­larly con­verge for tea and bis­cuits at State House. The same min­nows, who make up Po­lad, have no re­spect for any­thing other than the al­lowances you are giv­ing them. Po­lad has no na­tional sig­nif­i­cance nor value. The ges­ture or sym­bol­ism is wel­come, but it un­for­tu­nately ends there. Real po­lit­i­cal di­a­logue is between po­lit­i­cal ac­tors who mat­ter and the Zim­babwe Elec­toral Com­mis­sion can eas­ily help you with fig­ures on who mat­ters. Don’t lis­ten to your ad­vis­ers most of whom are hang­ers on, seek­ing their next meal and would gladly put you on the ta­ble for din­ner as they did to Mu­gabe should the op­por­tu­nity arise. Do you trust the same peo­ple who feigned loy­alty to Mu­gabe only to sell him out when it served their self­ish in­ter­ests, do you see na­tion builders in the same peo­ple who, with you, were part of the plun­der­ing for the past 40 years?, Many of your ad­vis­ers are driven by self-in­ter­est and you are in a bet­ter position to check their past. In this re­gard your cur­rent re­la­tions won’t help Zim­babwe and your 2017 speech will re­main a foot­note in his­tory with­out you en­gag­ing in gen­uine po­lit­i­cal di­a­logue with your po­lit­i­cal nemesis Nel­son Chamisa. You are kick­ing the can down the road as Mu­gabe did from 2000 to 2008. Zim­bab­weans are des­per­ate to live nor­mal lives, and this won’t hap­pen in an en­vi­ron­ment in which you as the Pres­i­dent can­not be mag­nan­i­mous enough to sit with your ri­val and agree on an eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal blue­print that the na­tion can rally be­hind. If the sta­tus quo is as a re­sult of the na­ture of po­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion which brought you to power, mil­i­tary tanks rolling on the streets, then per­sua­sively en­gage your col­leagues in Zanu PF and the se­cu­rity sec­tor to be for­ward think­ing. The fu­ture of my chil­dren and yours in­clud­ing our grand­chil­dren rests not so much on the se­cu­rity of­fered by the mil­i­tary, but on a har­mo­nious so­ci­ety and this should be your true legacy. Would your Ex­cel­lency want to be com­pared to the Idi Amins and Pol Pots of this world? A pos­i­tive legacy for you will be to build a so­ci­ety free from poverty and want, this can­not hap­pen when there is fear of the se­cu­rity sec­tor that is part of the rul­ing party. You should be re­mem­bered as a uni­fier, above party po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests and fo­cused on the na­tional in­ter­ests. Your ad­vis­ers, who are des­per­ate for jobs and a quick buck, may not tell you this. Yet if you achieve na­tional unity and re­fo­cus Zim­babwe on the path of na­tional devel­op­ment out­side par­ti­san pol­i­tics and end the vi­o­lence that have per­vaded our so­ci­ety your grand­chil­dren will read about you with a smile and pride say­ing here was a great man. The re­v­erse is equally true. En­joy the day.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200725,"Ben­jamin W Mkapa: A life­time of ser­vice to SADC, Africa","The for­mer Tan­za­nian leader was in­stru­men­tal in the es­tab­lish­ment of the South­ern African Re­search and Doc­u­men­ta­tion Cen­tre ( SARDC), an in­de­pen­dent re­gional knowl­edge re­source cen­tre es­tab­lished in 1985, to strengthen re­gional pol­icy per­spec­tives and track im­ple­men­ta­tion on a range of is­sues in south­ern Africa. SOUTH­ERN Africa woke up on July 24, 2020 to the shock­ing news that for­mer United Repub­lic of Tan­za­nia Pres­i­dent Ben­jamin Wil­liam Mkapa is no more. In a tele­vised speech, Pres­i­dent John Magu­fuli an­nounced that Mkapa died in a Dar es Salaam hospi­tal at the age of 81. “I am sad­dened by the death of the third Pres­i­dent of Tan­za­nia and that is a big loss for us as a coun­try. Let’s pray for him and more in­for­ma­tion will fol­low later,” Magu­fuli said. Mkapa was the coun­try’s third Pres­i­dent af­ter in­de­pen­dence from Bri­tain in 1961 and ruled from 1995 to 2005. Born in Lu­paso vil­lage of Mt­wara Re­gion, near the bor­der be­tween Tan­za­nia and Mozam­bique, Mkapa’s hum­ble early years prob­a­bly tough­ened him up for his fu­ture role as leader of his coun­try. In his mem­oirs ti­tled “My Life, My Pur­pose: A Tan­za­nian Pres­i­dent Re­mem­bers” that was re­leased in Novem­ber 2019, Mkapa re­counts his child­hood mem­o­ries dur­ing which his cat­e­chist fa­ther, Wil­liam Mat­wani, pro­fessed his strong de­sire for his last born, Ben­jamin, “to be­come a priest, fail­ing that a doc­tor or a teacher”. How thrilled Wil­liam Se­nior was when his loved son en­rolled in the Bene­dic­tine sem­i­nary in 1957 to kick­start a jour­ney that was sup­posed to make him a proud fa­ther, only to be crushed when the same son dropped out of the sem­i­nary be­fore qual­i­fy­ing. Nei­ther did Mkapa be­come a doc­tor nor a teacher as per the wishes of his fa­ther. Rather, he earned a de­gree in English in Uganda and later worked as a jour­nal­ist. He later joined the pub­lic ser­vice, first as a For­eign Ser­vice Of­fi­cer in 1963 and ris­ing through the ranks to be­come a cabi­net min­is­ter in Ny­erere’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, and later the first pres­i­dent to be elected un­der the multi-party sys­tem in Tan­za­nia. In the end, while he did not live up to his fa­ther’s de­sires, he is con­fi­dent that his fa­ther died a proud man, es­pe­cially hav­ing seen his son be­ing ap­pointed min­is­ter by Tan­za­nia’s found­ing Pres­i­dent Mwal­imu Julius Ny­erere. He was, how­ever, dis­ap­pointed that his par­ents died be­fore he rose to the high­est po­lit­i­cal ech­e­lon in the coun­try, for they would have been proud of their son’s achieve­ments. Mkapa’s po­lit­i­cal jour­ney started when Ny­erere ap­pointed him as his press sec­re­tary in 1974. He refers to the in­flu­ence he got from Ny­erere sev­eral times in the mem­oirs, to a point that it al­most be­comes more a book about Ny­erere than about Mkapa, demon­strat­ing the deep re­spect he had for his men­tor. “Mwal­imu Julius Ny­erere was un­doubt­edly the great­est in­flu­ence on my per­sonal growth as a leader and on my ca­reer,” Mkapa said of his for­mer men­tor, adding that “he was my teacher in ev­ery sense”. Writ­ing in his mem­oirs, Mkapa said the Tan­za­nian econ­omy was not do­ing well when he as­sumed the pres­i­dency on 23 Novem­ber 1995. Faced with this enor­mous chal­lenge, Mkapa in­sti­tuted a raft of eco­nomic re­forms, a num­ber of them not pop­u­lar within the coun­try and be­yond, earn­ing the jour­nal­ist-cum-pres­i­dent the nick­name Mzee Ukapa, drawn from Kiswahili phrase “anakula ukapa” mean­ing “you have noth­ing”. In­ter­est­ingly, he also be­came known as “Mr Clean” for his re­lent­less ef­forts to rid the coun­try of cor­rup­tion. For his ef­forts, he left of­fice a proud man, hav­ing seen an in­crease in gov­ern­ment rev­enue from when he be­came pres­i­dent in 1995 and when he left of­fice in De­cem­ber 2005. Mkapa was also in­stru­men­tal in driv­ing Tan­za­nia’s for­eign pol­icy, hav­ing served as Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs un­der both Pres­i­dents Ny­erere and Ali Has­san Mwinyi. In the mem­oirs, he re­calls that Tan­za­nia’s role in the lib­er­a­tion of south­ern African coun­tries was not an easy feat at all, es­pe­cially as Tan­za­nia and other Front­line States strug­gled to unite the lib­er­a­tion move­ments in the var­i­ous coun­tries that were fight­ing for self-rule. He held sev­eral cabi­net posts, such as for­eign min­is­ter and in­for­ma­tion min­is­ter and also served as am­bas­sador to the United States be­fore he was elected pres­i­dent. His death is, how­ever, not a loss to Tan­za­nia alone, but to the rest of Africa, in par­tic­u­lar in east­ern and south­ern Africa where Mkapa was ded­i­cated to the lib­er­a­tion of the sub-con­ti­nent. He was a uni­fier, hav­ing been in­volved in the me­di­a­tion pro­cesses in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Kenya and Bu­rundi. On power-shar­ing in Kenya, the ne­go­ti­a­tions were “not easy for both par­ties to agree upon, par­tic­u­larly as each side wanted ex­clu­sive power,” Mkapa said of the two for­ma­tions be­hind pres­i­den­tial con­tes­tants Raila Odinga and Mwai Kibaki in 2008. The DRC me­di­a­tion ef­forts were not easy ei­ther, and he does not mince his words about the dif­fi­cul­ties en­coun­tered. “We found it im­pos­si­ble to deal with the rag­tag po­lit­i­cal par­ties,” Mkapa wrote in his mem­oirs. He added: “They would sign agree­ments and agree on repa­tri­a­tions, then within weeks they were quar­relling about what the signed agree­ment meant.” Mkapa had most re­cently at­tempted to me­di­ate be­tween Bu­rundi’s gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion groups af­ter a dis­puted 2015 elec­tion plunged the coun­try into cri­sis, how­ever, the gov­ern­ment re­peat­edly re­fused to take part and the talks went nowhere. Re­gard­less of the dif­fi­cul­ties, Mkapa re­mained proud of how he sus­tained Tan­za­nia’s pro­file on the in­ter­na­tional scene, largely as a peace­maker. Mkapa was pas­sion­ate about the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal in­te­gra­tion of the SADC re­gion and is cred­ited with the launch of the Re­gional In­dica­tive Strate­gic De­vel­op­ment Plan (RISDP), the re­gion’s long-term strate­gic plan. A strong be­liever in the power of re­gional co­op­er­a­tion in the fight against poverty, Mkapa urged SADC mem­ber states to “run while oth­ers walk”. “Let us now run in or­der to nar­row the gap be­tween our re­gion and the de­vel­oped world,” he said in a fore­word to the RISDP which has guided SADC in es­tab­lish­ing a shared re­gional com­mu­nity. He chaired SADC be­tween Au­gust 2003 and Au­gust 2004 and launched the re­gional de­vel­op­ment blue­print in 2004. He be­lieved in the power of the youth in con­tribut­ing to the de­vel­op­ment of SADC and the rest of Africa. It was his wish that SADC lever­ages the vast “knowl­edge div­i­dend” that re­sides in its young peo­ple by har­ness­ing new tech­nol­ogy to en­sure deeper re­gional in­te­gra­tion. Speak­ing dur­ing a pub­lic lec­ture on the side­lines of the 39th SADC Sum­mit held in Dar es Salaam in Au­gust 2019, Mkapa called for the re­vamp of the ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem to “of­fer the kind of skills that will not only al­low them to sur­vive but to thrive.” “With a bur­geon­ing pop­u­la­tion in SADC, the ma­jor­ity of whom are youths, we have to harness their po­ten­tial in an age dom­i­nated by dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies,” he said. The for­mer Tan­za­nian leader was in­stru­men­tal in the es­tab­lish­ment of the South­ern African Re­search and Doc­u­men­ta­tion Cen­tre (SARDC), an in­de­pen­dent re­gional knowl­edge re­source cen­tre es­tab­lished in 1985, to strengthen re­gional pol­icy per­spec­tives and track im­ple­men­ta­tion on a range of is­sues in south­ern Africa. SARDC is a widely re­spected de­vel­op­ment re­search in­sti­tu­tion that pro­vides knowl­edge sup­port to re­gional pol­icy ini­tia­tives such as in­dus­tri­al­iza­tion, en­ergy de­vel­op­ment, cli­mate change, wa­ter re­sources, gen­der and de­vel­op­ment, and China-Africa re­la­tions. — sardc.net",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180421,ED’s pro-busi­ness stance gets nod,"PRES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa’s bold pol­icy ini­tia­tives to open up Zimbabwe to for­eign in­vestors have cre­ated good­will and ex­cite­ment across the re­gion, a vis­it­ing Zam­bian min­is­ter has said. Of­fi­cially open­ing the Mashona­land West is Open for Busi­ness Con­fer­ence in Chin­hoyi yes­ter­day, Zam­bian Min­is­ter for South­ern Prov­ince Dr Ed­ify Ha­mukale said the new ad­min­is­tra­tion’s cur­rent pol­icy thrust was likely to ben­e­fit the whole South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (Sadc) re­gion. The highly-sub­scribed event , which was or­gan­ised by the Char­tered In­sti­tute of Project Man­agers Zimbabwe, drew more than 500 del­e­gates, in­clud­ing lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional in­vestors, se­nior Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and rep­re­sen­ta­tives of lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and the cor­po­rate world. “I wish to thank His Ex­cel­lency, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, for the ini­tia­tive to open up Zimbabwe and it is ex­cit­ing that there is so much good­will. I can tell you ev­ery­one wants to come to Zimbabwe. “It is re­ally look­ing pos­i­tive, so we are so lucky we are one of those that have po­si­tioned our­selves to do busi­ness with you,” said Dr Ha­mukale. “This is im­pres­sive and I wish to con­grat­u­late you for the bold de­ci­sion to be­gin to open up for the rest of the world and we as your neigh­bours are com­mit­ting our­selves to en­sure that we de­velop to­gether.” Dr Ha­mukale, who was the guest of hon­our, said there was need for coun­tries to har­ness the power of glob­al­i­sa­tion for the ben­e­fit of their cit­i­zens. “It (glob­al­i­sa­tion) car­ries with it the prospect of im­prov­ing the lives of peo­ple in all coun­tries. What we should try to do is to man­age glob­al­i­sa­tion and make it work for our cit­i­zens. “Chief among the op­por­tu­ni­ties that glob­al­i­sa­tion gives rise to is the prospect of higher growth and higher liv­ing stan­dards for our peo­ple. “By pro­mot­ing free trade, coun­tries and neigh­bour­ing prov­inces can de­ploy to the max­i­mum ex­tent pos­si­ble, the law of com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage, and lead­ing to higher in­comes for the cit­i­zens,” he said. The Zam­bian min­is­ter said in­ter­na­tional rat­ings agen­cies need to be chal­lenged for their neg­a­tive ap­praisals on African coun­tries. “Why are they rating us when we are not rating them? So we need rating agen­cies so that they try to chal­lenge these find­ings, that there is poverty in our coun­tries. There is so much bias in the rat­ings. “I think we need rating agen­cies. I chal­lenge the African Union, Sadc and COMESA to some­how en­shrine rating of our own coun­tries; we should rate our own coun­tries. They can rate and we rate then we com­pare, if the fig­ures agree, then we be­lieve them,” he said. Neg­a­tive stereo­types, he added, were neg­a­tively af­fect­ing the im­age of the con­ti­nent. Dr Ha­mukale, who is also a busi­ness­man and agri­cul­tural ex­pert, said there was need for safety nets for vul­ner­a­ble groups that have lost out to glob­al­i­sa­tion. “We need to come up with a re­sponse for those who have lost out from glob­al­i­sa­tion. We can make an im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to come up with poli­cies that have the po­ten­tial to de­liver some of these ben­e­fits to these peo­ple,” he said.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180420,Quick eco­nomic turn­around every­one’s busi­ness,"THE econ­omy has been haem­or­rhag­ing for decades and Zim­bab­weans should take ad­van­tage of the new po­lit­i­cal dis­pen­sa­tion to work to­gether to stop fur­ther dam­age. In his ad­dress on Zim­babwe’s 38th in­de­pen­dence an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions at the Na­tional Sports Sta­dium on Wed­nes­day, Pres­i­dent Mnangagwa an­nounced many pol­icy mea­sures that will drive the coun­try to­wards quick eco­nomic re­cov­ery. An­chored on the Pres­i­dent’s con­sis­tence in pur­suit of in­vest­ment-led eco­nomic re­cov­ery, job cre­ation, en­hanc­ing the ease of do­ing busi­ness, at­tain­ing na­tional food se­cu­rity, poverty re­duc­tion, con­struc­tion and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture, ef­fec­tive pro­vi­sion of so­cial ser­vices and re­spect for the rule of law, the coun­try’s eco­nomic for­tunes can be turned around faster. But this all de­pends on ev­ery Zim­bab­wean play­ing ball. If the peo­ple em­brace the mo­men­tum that has been gen­er­ated so far that has seen in­creased in­vestor con­fi­dence, the coun­try could soon start en­joy­ing the fruits of the en­vis­aged growth of 4,5 per­cent in 2018. This growth will be driven by good per­for­mance in agri­cul­ture, min­ing, tourism and con­struc­tion sec­tors as well as plug­ging all rev­enue leak­ages that un­scrupu­lous peo­ple have used to ex­ter­nalise na­tional re­sources. The Gov­ern­ment is build­ing on the suc­cesses of Com­mand Agri­cul­ture to en­sure con­tin­ued food self-suf­fi­ciency and in­creased land util­i­sa­tion and pro­duc­tiv­ity through mech­a­ni­sa­tion and moderni­sa­tion of agri­cul­ture. The suc­cess of these ef­forts hinges on hard work, hon­esty and ded­i­ca­tion from all Zim­bab­weans. It is our hope the $37 mil­lion set aside to­wards the Na­tional Ir­ri­ga­tion Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme and ad­di­tional pack­ages from Rus­sia, China and Be­larus will see farm­ers be­ing equipped with req­ui­site ir­ri­ga­tion in­fra­struc­ture to mit­i­gate the va­garies of cli­mate change. Gov­ern­ment’s con­sis­tent sup­port for the min­ing sec­tor, in­clud­ing amend­ing the In­di­geni­sa­tion and Em­pow­er­ment pol­icy set­ting own­er­ship thresh­olds of 51:49 per­cent is def­i­nitely go­ing to at­tract more in­vestors into the sec­tor. The re­cently signed $4,2 bil­lion in­vest­ment agree­ment by Karo Re­sources to cre­ate an in­te­grated plat­inum project that has po­ten­tial to cre­ate 15 000 jobs stands as one of the fruits of the Gov­ern­ment’s pol­icy shift. To fa­cil­i­tate the moderni­sa­tion and re­tool­ing of Zim­babwe’s man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try, Gov­ern­ment should be lauded for its multi-pronged ef­forts to ac­cess lines of credit and af­ford­able long-term fi­nanc­ing for this sec­tor. As the coun­try con­tin­ues its drive to se­cure more For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment, value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of our pri­mary prod­ucts should not be down­played as the na­tion is set to earn more rev­enue. As more FDI flows into the coun­try, it is our hope that there will be a quick re­vival of strategic com­pa­nies such as the Na­tional Rail­ways of Zim­babwe and Zisco Steel, which are key to eco­nomic re­cov­ery. No coun­try can com­pet­i­tively con­duct busi­ness without de­vel­op­ing ICT in­fra­struc­ture and har­ness­ing tech­nol­ogy-driven in­no­va­tion in all sec­tors of the econ­omy and Gov­ern­ment should be lauded for sup­port­ing this sec­tor. The du­al­i­sa­tion of the Beit­bridge-Chirundu High­way, the Beit­bridge to Vic­to­ria Falls Road, the moderni­sa­tion of the Beit­bridge Bor­der Post and the ex­pan­sion of Robert Gabriel Mu­gabe In­ter­na­tional Air­port, among oth­ers, will also be key to­wards reviving the econ­omy. We urge Gov­ern­ment to sup­port the tourism sec­tor as it con­tin­ues to wit­ness in­creased growth, as in­di­cated by ar­rivals and flight fre­quen­cies of new air­lines that land at both Harare and the newly ex­panded Vic­to­ria Falls In­ter­na­tional Air­port. This is a sec­tor that pro­vides low hang­ing fruits and if ad­e­quately sup­ported has po­ten­tial to gen­er­ate hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars in for­eign cur­rency.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20180421,Zam­bian Min­is­ter hails ED poli­cies,"PRES­I­DENT Mnan­gagwa’s bold pol­icy ini­tia­tives to open up Zimbabwe to for­eign in­vestors have cre­ated good­will and ex­cite­ment across the re­gion, a vis­it­ing Zam­bian min­is­ter has said. Of­fi­cially open­ing the Mashona­land West is Open for Busi­ness Con­fer­ence in Chin­hoyi yes­ter­day, Zam­bian Min­is­ter for South­ern Prov­ince Dr Ed­ify Ha­mukale said the new ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pol­icy thrust was likely to ben­e­fit the whole South­ern African De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity (Sadc) re­gion. The highly sub­scribed event , which was or­gan­ised by the Char­tered In­sti­tute of Project Man­agers Zimbabwe, drew more than 500 del­e­gates, in­clud­ing lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional in­vestors, se­nior Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and rep­re­sen­ta­tives of lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and the cor­po­rate world. “I wish to thank His Ex­cel­lency, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, for the ini­tia­tive to open up Zimbabwe and it is ex­cit­ing that there is so much good­will. I can tell you ev­ery­one wants to come to Zimbabwe. “It is re­ally look­ing pos­i­tive, so we are so lucky we are one of those that have po­si­tioned our­selves to do busi­ness with you,” said Dr Ha­mukale. “This is im­pres­sive and I wish to con­grat­u­late you for the bold de­ci­sion to be­gin to open up for the rest of the world and we as your neigh­bours are com­mit­ting our­selves to en­sure that we de­velop to­gether.” Dr Ha­mukale said there was a need for coun­tries to har­ness the power of glob­al­i­sa­tion for the ben­e­fit of their cit­i­zens. “It (glob­al­i­sa­tion) car­ries with it the prospect of im­prov­ing the lives of peo­ple in all coun­tries. What we should try to do is to man­age glob­al­i­sa­tion and make it work for our cit­i­zens. “Chief among the op­por­tu­ni­ties that glob­al­i­sa­tion gives rise to is the prospect of higher growth and higher liv­ing stan­dards for our peo­ple. “By pro­mot­ing free trade, coun­tries and neigh­bour­ing prov­inces can de­ploy to the max­i­mum the law of com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage lead­ing to higher in­comes for the cit­i­zens,” he said. The Zam­bian min­is­ter said in­ter­na­tional rat­ings agen­cies need to be chal­lenged for their neg­a­tive ap­praisals on African coun­tries. “Why are they rating us when we are not rating them? So we need rating agen­cies so that they try to chal­lenge these find­ings, that there is poverty in our coun­tries. There is so much bias in the rat­ings. “I think we need rating agen­cies. I chal­lenge the African Union, Sadc and Comesa to some­how en­shrine rating of our own coun­tries; we should rate our own coun­tries. “They can rate and we rate then we com­pare, if the fig­ures agree, then we be­lieve them,” he said. Neg­a­tive stereo­types, he added, were neg­a­tively af­fect­ing the im­age of the con­ti­nent. Dr Ha­mukale, who is also a busi­ness­man and agri­cul­tural ex­pert, said there is a need for safety nets for vul­ner­a­ble groups that have lost out to glob­al­i­sa­tion. “We need to come up with a re­sponse for those who have lost out from glob­al­i­sa­tion. We can make an im­por­tant con­tri­bu­tion to come up with poli­cies that have the po­ten­tial to de­liver some of these ben­e­fits to these peo­ple,” he said.

Or for some­one who wants to be a li­brar­ian and has 10 points at Ad­vanced Level to fail to train as one be­cause they failed Math­e­mat­ics at “O” Level? We had got used to this some­one with good “O” Lev­els, even “A” Lev­els fail­ing to pur­sue their de­sired ca­reer paths be­cause they did not pass Form Four Math­e­mat­ics or English Lan­guage but the re­quire­ments were sim­ply un­fair and need­lessly mono­lithic. There is no doubt that there are hun­dreds of thou­sands of “O” and “A” Level grad­u­ates who are stranded all over the coun­try with­out a ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion or any hope of ever at­tain­ing it be­cause they did not pass the two lan­guages. It is sad that in ad­di­tion to th­ese, there are thou­sands of peo­ple who had been study­ing at poly­tech­nics but were forced to dis­con­tinue their stud­ies af­ter the Math­e­mat­ics re­quire­ment was made com­pul­sory in 2006 even for those al­ready en­rolled at in­sti­tu­tions of higher learn­ing. This, in our opin­ion, rep­re­sents an ar­ti­fi­cial prob­lem that has con­demned many of our peo­ple to a life of hope­less­ness, emo­tional suf­fer­ing and poverty. The Govern­ment has now pro­posed re­lax­ing the en­try re­quire­ments and given in­sti­tu­tions of higher and ter­tiary learn­ing the green light to fix the qual­i­fi­ca­tions as ap­pro­pri­ate, not the old ob­ses­sion with Math­e­mat­ics and or English Lan­guage. Higher and Ter­tiary Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Amon Mur­wira told the lat­est edi­tion of our sis­ter pa­per, Sun­dayNews: “It re­mains the in­sti­tu­tion’s re­spon­si­bil­ity to re­vise en­try re­quire­ments. As a min­istry we leave such de­ci­sions to the col­leges. Our role is to give di­rec­tion and not di­rec­tives on aca­demic mat­ters. We leave aca­demic boards to ex­er­cise their in­de­pen­dence and rights. “I might have been mis­con­strued when I talked about en­try qual­i­fi­ca­tions. I never said scrap Maths. Some ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions com­plained that some of the en­try re­quire­ments were not rel­e­vant or match­ing some of the cour­ses, and en­rol­ment num­bers were plum­met­ing. I said if you feel a par­tic­u­lar pro­gramme like Ho­tel and Cater­ing or a purely Arts pro­gramme does not re­quire Maths, why not re­vise that. “Our pol­icy is a pol­icy of in­clu­sive ed­u­ca­tion, recog­nis­ing that peo­ple have dif­fer­ent tal­ents. As a coun­try we should have peo­ple of dif­fer­ent spe­cial­i­sa­tions. We can’t all be en­gi­neers. We need jour­nal­ists, teach­ers and a host of other pro­fes­sion­als. We don’t want to see a stu­dent who de­serves to be in col­lege roam­ing the streets, no. Ways should be found to en­sure that such a per­son gets a chance to be in col­lege. “If the in­sti­tu­tions had agreed on a gen­eral rule among them­selves and it’s now re­sult­ing in stu­dents’ num­bers fall­ing, then it’s up to them to look at that rule again. I’ve al­ways said, you are not cat­tle on a yoke. We de­ployed you to those in­sti­tu­tions trust­ing that you are ca­pa­ble. We ex­pect th­ese peo­ple (prin­ci­pals) to think and ad­vise us. We don’t want par­rots run­ning our in­sti­tu­tions.” The old re­quire­ments served no pur­pose apart from mak­ing our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem too exclusive yet ed­u­ca­tion must be in­clu­sive. It did not recog­nise the ob­vi­ous fact that peo­ple pos­sess dif­fer­ent ca­pa­bil­i­ties. In ad­di­tion, it dis­re­garded the fact that the job mar­ket is di­verse and each job is dif­fer­ent from the other, thus the skills that peo­ple do­ing those jobs must have are dif­fer­ent. The blan­ket English lan­guage re­quire­ment was, with the ben­e­fit of hind­sight now, very un­just. It ac­corded the lan­guage a sta­tus that was far su­pe­rior to oth­ers yet our na­tional con­sti­tu­tion recog­nises 16 of­fi­cial lan­guages. In a coun­try of our his­tory, such a sit­u­a­tion was deeply re­gret­table. Some­one with a pass in his or her mother tongue could not ad­vance his or her ed­u­ca­tion be­cause they failed the lan­guage of the colo­nial­ist! It is ob­vi­ous that English Lan­guage does not dom­i­nate China’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem or job mar­ket. And that English Lan­guage does not dom­i­nate in Swahili-speak­ing East Africa but that has not pre­vented China or Tan­za­nia from pro­gress­ing. We don’t know if the pre­ferred sta­tus that English Lan­guage en­joyed could have with­stood a Con­sti­tu­tional Court chal­lenge in a coun­try that recog­nises 16 lan­guages. Is there a pos­si­bil­ity that some­one who had passes in five “O” Level sub­jects and ap­proached the su­pe­rior court chal­leng­ing a de­ci­sion by a lo­cal col­lege to deny him a place to train as a Tonga or Shangaan teacher be­cause he had no pass in English Lan­guage would have lost their case? It would have been an in­ter­est­ing con­sti­tu­tional case but we ar­gue the per­son was go­ing to get a pos­i­tive judg­ment. The Govern­ment has taken a good de­ci­sion that ac­cords greater free­dom to col­leges and univer­si­ties to de­cide what is good for their train­ing pro­grammes. With com­plaints that en­rol­ment fig­ures were fall­ing largely be­cause of the Math­e­mat­ics re­quire­ment, we fore­see col­lege and univer­sity au­thor­i­ties ex­er­cis­ing their judg­ments in a way that helps boost their stu­dent bod­ies nu­mer­i­cally and open up op­por­tu­ni­ties to those who were be­ing ex­cluded.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20181001,Ethiopia to Mau­ri­tius: How will Africa match jobs?,"AS AFRICA seeks new ways to tackle high debt, low pay and in­equal­ity, No­bel lau­re­ate Joseph Stiglitz be­lieves two coun­tries of­fer an al­ter­na­tive to the Asian tiger model There’s a speech that the No­bel-prize win­ning econ­o­mist Joseph Stiglitz has been tak­ing around African coun­tries these past few years. Last au­tumn the venue was South Africa’s cap­i­tal, Cape Town, and the is­sue was among the most press­ing fac­ing the con­ti­nent: how its economies can grow fast enough to keep up with the world’s most sharply ex­pand­ing and youth­ful pop­u­la­tions, which will in­clude three-quar­ters of the ad­di­tional 4 bil­lion peo­ple on the planet by the end of this cen­tury. It is a prob­lem that has been trou­bling many, in­clud­ing the bil­lion­aire phi­lan­thropist Bill Gates. And Stiglitz’s mes­sage is not en­tirely re­as­sur­ing. The Asian mir­a­cle of man­u­fac­tur­ing ex­port-led growth, he told his au­di­ence bluntly, can’t and won’t be re­peated in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Some­thing dif­fer­ent is needed, he said. The ques­tion, how­ever, is pre­cisely what. Stiglitz’s in­ter­ven­tions in the de­bate mat­ter. A se­ries of wor­ry­ing eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors are emerg­ing ex­actly at the mo­ment of max­i­mum con­cern over how African coun­tries — and the in­ter­na­tional aid strate­gies sup­port­ing them — can create suf­fi­cient jobs, es­pe­cially for young peo­ple amid a pop­u­la­tion bulge. Not least among the var­i­ous alarm bells that have been rung this year are warn­ings over fal­ter­ing ef­forts to re­duce chronic poverty, re­flected in the fact that Nige­ria — one of the re­gion’s big­gest growth economies — has over­taken In­dia in terms of num­bers of the very poor­est. An­other cause of con­cern has been the grow­ing in­debt­ed­ness of African coun­tries, of­ten for costly in­fra­struc­ture projects backed by China, which some fear may soon be un­sus­tain­able. In­stead of the “Asian tiger” model — or even sug­ges­tions that African coun­tries could model them­selves on China — Stiglitz favours a more com­plex and multi-faceted ap­proach. The econ­o­mist has sin­gled out coun­tries as di­verse as the tiny In­dian Ocean is­land of Mau­ri­tius — which he dubbed a “mir­a­cle” after a visit in 2011 — and Ethiopia. While Mau­ri­tius ticks mul­ti­ple boxes as a suc­cess story in eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and adapt­abil­ity, how far its achieve­ments are ex­portable is open to ques­tion. The is­land has a pop­u­la­tion of 1.3 mil­lion, po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and an ef­fec­tive wel­fare state pro­vid­ing free ed­u­ca­tion and health­care, but it is also at­trac­tive for other rea­sons. It has a largely bilin­gual pop­u­la­tion, with most Mau­ri­tians speak­ing both English and French, and also has ties to In­dia, China and the African main­land. His­tor­i­cally, it has man­aged the tran­si­tion since in­de­pen­dence in the late 1960s from re­liance largely on a sin­gle re­source — sugar —through a pe­riod of tex­tiles man­u­fac­tur­ing in the 80s and 90s to where it is now, emerg­ing as a hub for offshore fi­nan­cial ser­vices (some of them murky), call cen­tres and an emerg­ing tech fo­cus com­bined. All in ad­di­tion to the tourism for which it is most fa­mous. Away from the more fa­mil­iar im­ages of beaches dot­ted with hon­ey­moon­ing cou­ples, and the ex­pen­sive sec­ond homes of Euro­pean ex­pats along the west coast, the Mau­ri­tian ap­proach is rep­re­sented by the grow­ing cy­ber city of Ebene on the out­skirts of the cap­i­tal, Port Louis, where shiny new of­fice blocks hous­ing banks and call cen­tres jos­tle by the high­way. Pratima Sew­pal of the Mau­ri­tius Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board is among those with an in­ter­est in pro­mot­ing tech busi­nesses and ser­vices. “When we started pro­mot­ing this in 2004 there were some 60 com­pa­nies,” says Sew­pal, “and now we have around 800 com­pa­nies em­ploy­ing 24 000 peo­ple en­gaged in var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties. The ob­jec­tive is to create 15,000 ad­di­tional jobs by 2030 through ini­tia­tives put in place by the govern­ment.” That, ex­plains Sew­pal, has in­cluded dou­bling the size of the univer­sity en­gi­neer­ing pro­gramme and the pro­mo­tion of “re­con­ver­sion” cour­ses to en­cour­age grad­u­ates from other dis­ci­plines to re­train for the ser­vice in­dus­tries. If there is a catch-22, it is that roughly 24 per­cent of 16 to 24-year-olds and 30 per­cent of women are un­em­ployed, de­spite labour short­ages and an age­ing pop­u­la­tion with a stag­nant birthrate, a prob­lem usu­ally blamed on a mis­match in ed­u­ca­tional skills. More­over, de­spite the re­gion’s im­pres­sive growth in the past 10 years, as the World Bank has made clear, the same decade has also brought a sharp in­crease in in­equal­ity, with the gap be­tween the is­land’s poor­est and the rich­est 10 per­cent of house­holds in­creas­ing by ap­prox­i­mately 37 per­cent. Ak­bar Khan is among the more for­tu­nate. Now aged 30, he left school at 13 to work as a ca­sual labourer. He learned to be­come a car me­chanic, earn­ing £2 a day. His life was trans­formed by the Hal­ley Foun­da­tion, a small or­gan­i­sa­tion run by two lawyers based in his home­town, Nou­velle France. The foun­da­tion ran a men­tor­ing scheme to en­cour­age 10 young peo­ple a year to es­tab­lish a busi­ness on their own. “Be­fore join­ing the scheme in 2015, it was dif­fi­cult. I didn’t have many prospects, so I wanted to set up on my own. Now I have my own garage and I have four peo­ple work­ing for me,” he says. Many of his friends, he ad­mits, have not done so well. “Some of them are work­ing, in shops and tea cul­ti­va­tion. But oth­ers are un­em­ployed.” While Mau­ri­tius has unique ad­van­tages that have pro­jected the tiny na­tion to the top of de­vel­op­ment ta­bles, re­gion­ally the chal­lenges, set against the on­go­ing pop­u­la­tion bub­ble, defy sim­ple so­lu­tions. De­spite a large po­ten­tial pool of cheap labour, costs re­main higher than in Asia. The long-vaunted de­mo­graphic div­i­dend, which some had ar­gued would bring growth and jobs to Africa, no longer seems a given. So, how to square the cir­cle of African eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and job cre­ation? For Stiglitz, there is no eco­nomic deus ex machina wait­ing in the wings, ca­pa­ble of de­liv­er­ing a sud­den surge in jobs and pros­per­ity – cer­tainly not in the form of a new man­u­fac­tur­ing boom. - The Guardian .",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150529,Africa Day: Time for Africa,"THIS week we cel­e­brated Africa Day. Africa has come a long way since the found­ing of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of African Unity in 1963, cur­rently known as the Africa Union (AU). The African Union, com­prises of 54 mem­ber states, brought to­gether to col­lec­tively ad­dress the chal­lenges Africa has faced, namely, armed con­flict, cli­mate change, and poverty. Africa has cer­tainly trans­formed it­self as is widely con­sid­ered to be the last fron­tier. Over the last decade, Africa has been the sec­ond fastest grow­ing re­gion in the world af­ter Asia. With over a bil­lion peo­ple (50% be­low the age of 24) Africa will boast the high­est pro­por­tion of work­ing age pop­u­la­tion by 2040. That’s more than China and In­dia. Africa has the largest un­tapped nat­u­ral re­sources in the world and over 60% of the world’s arable land. Africa’s time has come. There is an old African proverb that says “Un­less the lion has his own sto­ry­teller, the hunter will al­ways have the best part of the story”. Africa needs to tell its own story and it is about time that Africans tell their own story of Africa Ris­ing. “Africa is a place re­plete with pos­si­bil­i­ties”, stated Kgalema Mot­lanthe the vice-pres­i­dent of the Repub­lic of South Africa. It is no more a se­cret that Africa is fast be­com­ing more sig­nif­i­cant in the global land­scape. Even the high­lyre­garded Econ­o­mist mag­a­zine had to ac­knowl­edge its folly when it ini­tially re­ferred to Africa as “The hope­less con­ti­nent” on the 13th May 2000. On the 3rd March 2013, that same mag­a­zine re­ferred to “Africa Ris­ing: The hope­ful con­ti­nent” on it’s front cover. Africa has en­joyed over two decades on un­in­ter­rupted growth. Since 1992, Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa (SSA), has grown steadily and even as the world went into re­ces­sion post the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008, Africa con­tin­ued to grow. The growth in Africa has been driven partly by com­mod­ity prices and a host of other fac­tors. Ac­cord­ing to the world’s lead­ing con­sul­tants Mckin­sey and Com­pany, “nat­u­ral re­sources, and the re­lated govern­ment spend­ing they fi­nanced, gen­er­ated just 32% of Africa’s GDP growth from 2000 through 2008. The re­main­ing two-thirds came from other sec­tors, in­clud­ing whole­sale and re­tail, trans­porta­tion, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, and man­u­fac­tur­ing. Eco­nomic growth ac­cel­er­ated across the con­ti­nent, in 27 of its 30 largest economies. In­deed, coun­tries with and with­out sig­nif­i­cant re­source ex­ports had sim­i­lar GDP growth rates.” Sadly, Zim­babwe has not par­tic­i­pated in the African growth story over the last 15 years. In what’s been coined the “lost decade”, Zim­babwe’s GDP con­tracted by over 50%. Since dol­lar­i­sa­tion in 2009, growth re­cov­ered some­what but since 2014 growth has once again stag­nated. So what does Africa look like to­day? Ac­cord­ing to Mckin­sey and Com­pany, Africa’s col­lec­tive GDP is over US$1,6 tril­lion, that’s sim­i­lar in size to Rus­sia, In­dia and Brazil. I of­ten re­fer to Africa as the for­got­ten Bric. Con­sumer spend­ing ex­ceeds US$860 bil­lion and is one of the fastest grow­ing con­sumer mar­kets in the world. It’s lit­tle won­der why global con­sumer com­pa­nies like Nes­tle have started to take Africa more se­ri­ously. Africa has the fastest grow­ing mo­bile mar­ket in the world with over 316 mil­lion sub­scribers since 2000. In 2000, there were no more than 20 000 fixed line phones in Nige­ria and a 10 year wait­ing list. To­day there are over 134 mil­lion mo­bile phone sub­scribers in Nige­ria. This has com­pletely trans­formed the way peo­ple do busi­ness in Africa. Ac­cord­ing to lead­ing re­search, a 10% in­crease in mo­bile pen­e­tra­tion in­creases to­tal Fac­tor Pro­duc­tiv­ity by 4,2% in the long run and con­trib­utes over 0,25% to per capita GDP per an­num in Africa. Africa has 60% of the world’s un­cul­ti­vated land suited for crop pro­duc­tion, but has 30% of the world’s mal­nour­ished and only 3% of global agri­cul­tural ex­ports. Africa needs to cul­ti­vate a strat­egy to de­velop agriculture. Small­holder farm­ers will be key to African ef­forts not only to feed it­self, but also to be­come a ma­jor food sup­plier for the rest of the world. Africa’s agri­cul­tural po­ten­tial is clear. Pro­duc­tiv­ity can also be boosted through the use bet­ter farm­ing meth­ods, fer­tiliser and ir­ri­ga­tion. African ce­real yields are just over one-third of the de­vel­op­ing world av­er­age, for ex­am­ple, linked to the fact that as much as 80% of Africa’s agriculture still de­pends on rain not ir­ri­ga­tion. Some African gov­ern­ments see the ef­fi­cien­cies of large-scale com­mer­cial farm­ing as a means to ful­fil this po­ten­tial. But Africa can­not in­crease its food pro­duc­tion, cre­ate jobs, and re­duce poverty on the scale re­quired with­out un­lock­ing the po­ten­tial of small­holder agriculture. Nearly two out of three Africans de­pend on agriculture for their liveli­hoods. In­deed, Africa’s rapidly grow­ing youth pop­u­la­tion makes job creation an ur­gent mat­ter for many of the con­ti­nent’s gov­ern­ments. So what will Africa look to­mor­row? GDP is pro­jected to grow to US$2,6 tril­lion while con­sumer spend­ing is ex­pected to ex­ceed US$1,4 tril­lion by 2020. Africa will have the high­est pro­por­tion of work­ing age pop­u­la­tion in the world by 2040, far ex­ceed­ing China and In­dia. That cer­tainly poses a chal­lenge for many gov­ern­ments across Africa. Over the next three decades Africa needs to cre­ate over one bil­lion jobs. That’s no easy task. This trans­for­ma­tion has not gone un­no­ticed and is re­flected by the sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in FDI flows to Africa. Over the last decade FDI flows to Africa have in­creased over seven fold from less than US$10 bil­lion in 2000 to over US$80 bil­lion in 2013. This trend is ex­pected to con­tinue as long as Africa’s growth story re­mains in­tact. The re­cent fall in com­mod­ity prices es­pe­cially oil has neg­a­tively im­pacted growth in a num­ber of African coun­tries in­clud­ing Nige­ria and An­gola. De­spite this the IMF projects SSA to grow by 4,5% in 2015, and 5,1% in 2016, mak­ing it the sec­ond fastest grow­ing re­gion in the world af­ter emerg­ing and de­vel­op­ing Asia. Against this back­drop Zim­babwe is ex­pected to grow by 2,8% in 2015 and 2,7% in 2016. As we look back at the last 52 years it will be in­ter­est­ing to see what the next fifty years looks like. Africa has en­joyed tremen­dous suc­cess over the last 50 years and es­pe­cially the last two decades. Un­for­tu­nately, Zim­babwe has not par­tic­i­pated in the African re­nais­sance and risks be­ing left be­hind as the rest of Africa con­tin­ues to march ahead. Let’s hope we can get our act to­gether and turn this econ­omy around. Let’s hope that Zim­babwe can catch up and par­take in the African re­nais­sance. like",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20151023,Zim to se­cure $2bn more in new loans,"ZIM­BABWE’S vir­tu­ally broke gov­ern­ment this week ap­proved in cabi­net an am­bi­tious ex­ter­nal ar­rears clear­ance strat­egy to pay off US$1,8 bil­lion over­due to mul­ti­lat­eral cred­i­tors by June next year in a bid to break its debt vi­cious cy­cle and se­cure at least US$2 bil­lion in new fund­ing to res­cue a crum­bling econ­omy rav­aged by re­ces­sion, a liq­uid­ity crunch and de­fla­tion, among a plethora of other chronic prob­lems. Lat­est de­tailed in­for­ma­tion ob­tained this week by the Zim­babwe In­de­pen­dent from in­ter­na­tional financial in­sti­tu­tions (IFIs) shows the Harare gov­ern­ment — which pre­sented its strat­egy to mul­ti­lat­eral and bi­lat­eral cred­i­tors in Lima, Peru, on Oc­to­ber 8 be­fore over 100 top global financial ex­ec­u­tives — wants to break its debt trap and se­cure new fund­ing from var­i­ous sources to res­cue the im­plod­ing econ­omy. Cur­rently sad­dled with a debt over­hang of US$10,8 bil­lion ac­crued from both pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor bor­row­ing, Zim­babwe’s fail­ing econ­omy has plunged deeper into re­ces­sion since 2013 ow­ing to lim­ited sources of longterm fi­nance, paralysing the coun­try’s key sec­tors. The coun­try’s debt ar­rears amount to US$5,6 bil­lion split be­tween mul­ti­lat­eral cred­i­tors (US$2,2 bil­lion), the Paris Club, an in­for­mal group­ing of bi­lat­eral cred­i­tor na­tions (US$2,7 bil­lion), and non-Paris Club cred­i­tors (US$700 mil­lion). The coun­try has ar­rears es­ti­mated at US$1,8 bil­lion with its three pre­ferred cred­i­tors, In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF), World Bank (WB) and African De­vel­op­ment Bank (AfDB). Un­like the pri­vate sec­tor, which has an ex­ter­nal debt of over US$4 bil­lion, and is pay­ing ar­rears, the pub­lic sec­tor has been in un­ser­viced debt for nearly two decades mak­ing Zim­babwe in­el­i­gi­ble for con­ces­sion­ary fund­ing. Un­der the coun­try’s re­pay­ment strat­egy — also ap­proved by the rul­ing Zanu PF polit­buro last week — Zim­babwe will se­cure US$819 mil­lion bridge fi­nance from the African Ex­port-Im­port Bank (Afrex­im­bank) to re­pay ar­rears to the AfDB (US$585 mil­lion); African De­vel­op­ment Fund of the AfDB (US$16 mil­lion) and US$218 mil­lion to In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment As­so­ci­a­tion (IDA). The IDA is a World Bank fund for poor coun­tries. To get new fund­ing from the AfDB, Zim­babwe – clas­si­fied as one of the vul­ner­a­ble economies on the con­ti­nent to­gether with Su­dan, So­ma­lia and Eritrea — needs to clear its ar­rears first be­fore the end of 2016 when the funds are still avail­able. Zim­babwe will also need US$896 mil­lion to re­pay ar­rears to a World Bank as­so­ciate, the In­ter­na­tional Bank for Re­con­struc­tion and De­vel­op­ment (IBRD). The money to re­pay IBRD ar­rears will be se­cured from “bi­lat­eral loan fa­cil­i­ties from friendly coun­tries in cen­tral and north Africa”, ac­cord­ing to an ex­ec­u­tive rep­re­sent­ing a key mul­ti­lat­eral cred­i­tor. IBRD is a global de­vel­op­ment co­op­er­a­tive owned by its 188 mem­ber coun­tries. As the largest de­vel­op­ment bank in the world and part of the World Bank Group, IBRD has two main goals: to end ex­treme poverty by 2030 and to pro­mote shared pros­per­ity in a sus­tain­able man­ner. Zim­babwe will also have to pay the IMF US$110 mil­lion. It will use its spe­cial draw­ing rights to clear the amount. Af­ter pay­ing off the US$1,8 bil­lion to mul­ti­lat­eral cred­i­tors, Zim­babwe will then ap­proach the Paris Club seek­ing either debt for­give­ness or can­cel­la­tion of penal­ties ac­crued on ar­rears. It will also ap­proach nonParis Club cred­i­tors like China, Kuwait and oth­ers to work out a debt and ar­rears res­o­lu­tion plan. Zim­babwe owes the Paris Club cred­i­tor na­tions about US$6 bil­lion. Ar­rears con­trib­ute about US$1 bil­lion. Ar­rears to non-Paris Club cred­i­tors like China amount to US$476 mil­lion. “The IFIs would need to be re­paid si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­cause they are con­sid­ered pre­ferred cred­i­tors which should be treated equally,” the ex­ec­u­tive said. “The strat­egy, which is a non-HIPC (Highly In­debted Poor Coun­tries) route, was ap­proved by all cred­i­tors in Lima. So it is now up to Zim­babwe to com­plete the third re­view of the SMP by Fe­bru­ary or March and en­sure ar­rears clear­ance by June next year. “It’s also de­pen­dent on the coun­try pro­duc­ing a new eco­nomic plan show­ing how it is go­ing to use the new money which will come in and the im­ple­men­ta­tion of its own eco­nomic pro­grammes and re­forms that un­der­pin the whole strat­egy.” Since 2009, Zim­babwe re­sumed and has been pay­ing the IMF to­ken amounts. Ac­cord­ing to a writ­ten re­sponse to ques­tions sent to IMF res­i­dent rep­re­sen­ta­tive Chris­tian Bed­dies in Harare, Zim­babwe has been mak­ing to­ken pay­ments to the IMF’s Poverty Re­duc­tion and Growth Trust (PRGT) amount­ing to SDR11 mil­lion (about US$15,6 mil­lion). Bed­dies said to­ken pay­ments dur­ing the IMF’s Staff Mon­i­tor Pro­gramme (SMP) — an in­for­mal agree­ment be­tween coun­try author­i­ties and the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tion staff to mon­i­tor the im­ple­menta- tion of agreed eco­nomic pro­grammes and re­forms — were US$150 000 a month. The debt strat­egy, IFIs ex­ec­u­tives fur­ther said, was an­chored on the SMP, Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic blueprint ZimAs­set and Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe’s thread­bare 10-point plan, which among other is­sues, deals with re­forms on labour, ease of do­ing busi­ness, in­di­geni­sa­tion, align­ment of laws with new con­sti­tu­tion, com­pen­sa­tion for dis­pos­sessed white farm­ers, strength­en­ing of the financial sec­tor, re­vival of agri­cul­ture and re-en­gage­ment of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity. Asked for a com­ment, Re­serve Bank gover­nor John Man­gudya, who pre­sented Zim­babwe’s debt ar­rears clear­ance strat­egy in Lima, said this was the way for­ward as the coun­try needed to re­solve its ar­rears and un­lock new long-term fund­ing. “The strat­egy of clear­ing ar­rears is good for Zim­babwe. It’s good for cred­i­tors and would-be cred­i­tors,” he said. “It’s a friend­ship-build­ing strat­egy. It im­proves Zim­babwe’s ne­go­ti­at­ing power. Zim­babwe is now on the move.” How­ever, IFIs ex­ec­u­tives say for Zim­babwe’s debt ar­rears clear­ance strat­egy to suc­ceed, there is need for more struc­tural re­forms than cur­rently contemplated by the gov­ern­ment or even IMF which has been fo­cus­ing on nar­rowly tech­ni­cal, short-run changes that fall far short of what is needed. They say the cur­rent pol­icy fo­cus on for­eign cap­i­tal alone to res­cue the econ­omy is mis­placed be­cause fun­da­men­tal re­forms that ex­tend be­yond the norms of pol­icy are crit­i­cal. In par­tic­u­lar, IFIs ex­ec­u­tives say, Zim­babwe needs to pay far greater at­ten­tion than in the past to in­sti­tu­tional re­newal and deep re­forms. Im­proved poli­cies are un­likely to be de­signed and im­ple­mented by weak in­sti­tu­tions and even less likely to be ef­fi­cient with­out in­sti­tu­tional over­haul.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20201118,Three years on: Sec­ond Republic marches to pros­per­ity,"SINCE com­ing to power in Novem­ber 2017, the Sec­ond Republic un­der Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has made strides in job cre­ation, re-en­gage­ment, democ­racy, curb­ing cor­rup­tion, con­flict res­o­lu­tion and agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tiv­ity, among other achieve­ments aimed at fos­ter­ing so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and peace­ful co-ex­is­tence to erad­i­cate poverty. In his in­au­gu­ra­tion speech on Novem­ber 24, 2017, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa — the ser­vant leader — high­lighted that unity and peace was para­mount in achiev­ing eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. In his own words, the Pres­i­dent said: “Fel­low Zim­bab­weans, as we chart our way for­ward, we must ac­cept that our chal­lenges as a na­tion em­anate in part from the man­ner in which we have man­aged our pol­i­tics, both na­tion­ally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, lead­ing to cir­cum­stances in which our coun­try has un­de­servedly been per­ceived or clas­si­fied as a pariah State.” Af­firm­ing his se­ri­ous­ness in the fight against cor­rup­tion, as out­lined in his in­au­gu­ra­tion speech in 2017, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa fired then Health and Child Care Min­is­ter Dr Oba­diah Moyo on July 7, 2020. Moyo is fac­ing charges of cor­rup­tion and crim­i­nal abuse of of­fice over his role in the murky US$60 mil­lion deal with med­i­cal sup­plier Drax In­ter­na­tional. He be­came the sec­ond min­is­ter to be sacked from the cur­rent Cabi­net fol­low­ing the dis­missal of former Pub­lic Ser­vice, Labour and Social Wel­fare Min­is­ter Prisca Mup­fu­mira in Au­gust 2019 on sim­i­lar grounds. Both Moyo and Mup­fu­mira are on bail await­ing trial. The Pres­i­dent un­der­scored that the en­vis­aged new Zimbabwe but­tressed by ser­vant lead­er­ship where cor­rup­tion and un­nec­es­sary bu­reau­cracy would be a thing of the past, was within reach, al­though it could not be achieved overnight. “It will not be easy, but as the Holy Bi­ble teaches us: ‘For you have need of en­durance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may re­ceive what was promised,’” said the Pres­i­dent. Notwith­stand­ing the il­le­gal eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed on the coun­try by some Western coun­tries, the Sec­ond Republic crafted peo­ple-ori­ented five-year blue­prints premised on na­tional frame­works meant to bet­ter cit­i­zens’ liveli­hoods. On Mon­day, the Pres­i­dent launched the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Strat­egy 1 (NDS1); an eco­nomic mas­ter plan fo­cus­ing on in­clu­sive de­vel­op­ment from 2021 and 2025. Piv­oted on yet an­other strate­gic par­tic­i­pa­tory gov­er­nance plan ear­marked at cur­tail­ing re­source-based con­flict ar­eas; devo­lu­tion, NDS1 en­deav­ours to stream­line gen­der, youth women and other vul­ner­a­ble groups, thus cre­at­ing equal op­por­tu­ni­ties for all in an eco­nom­i­cally sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment. NDS1 is a suc­ces­sor step to the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) in the drive to achieve a mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030 as en­shrined in na­tional Vi­sion 2030. The TSP, a fis­cal and mon­e­tary re­form, which has brought the much needed eco­nomic sta­bil­ity the coun­try en­joys and lever­ages its growth tra­jec­to­ries on, was launched in Oc­to­ber 2018, and will run till the end of the year. Devo­lu­tion Devo­lu­tion is an­other mile­stone achieved in the past three years as Zimbabwe looks into the fu­ture with the Gov­ern­ment launch­ing the “Devo­lu­tion and De­cen­tral­i­sa­tion Pol­icy” this year, to spell out the con­sti­tu­tional re­quire­ments and strate­gies for im­ple­men­ta­tion frame­works across the coun­try’s 10 prov­inces. The Sec­ond Republic has com­mit­ted to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the pro­gramme through Trea­sury’s dis­burse­ment of $703 mil­lion al­lo­cated to 92 lo­cal au­thor­i­ties in the 2019 Na­tional Bud­get un­der in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal trans­fers. Gov­ern­ment has com­mit­ted $2,9 bil­lion to ac­cel­er­ate pro­gramme im­ple­men­ta­tion in 2020. The funds were ear­marked for cap­i­tal projects that ben­e­fit cit­i­zens in the fol­low­ing ser­vice ar­eas: schools and clin­ics, roads, plant and equip­ment, water, sewer and solid waste man­age­ment, elec­tric­ity and any other cap­i­tal ac­tiv­i­ties that may be deemed nec­es­sary for ser­vice pro­vi­sion. The phi­los­o­phy be­hind devo­lu­tion is to elim­i­nate marginal­i­sa­tion by de­cen­tral­is­ing power to pro­vin­cial and metropoli­tan coun­cils. In many ar­eas coun­try­wide water and san­i­ta­tion is­sues are be­ing ad­dressed, schools and med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties are be­ing con­structed, road re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion pro­grammes are also on­go­ing to com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing Gov­ern­ment pro­grammes. Lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are util­is­ing the funds to im­ple­ment their projects. Con­flict res­o­lu­tion Un­der Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, the Sec­ond Republic has taken a bold step to­wards ad­dress­ing con­flict through the sign­ing of the Na­tional Peace and Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion Com­mis­sion Act on Jan­uary 5, 2018. This paved the way for di­a­logue to­wards sus­tain­able peace and peace­ful co-ex­is­tence. Peace is the yard­stick of po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, and is key to so­cio-eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, be­cause with­out peace pol­i­tics be­comes a mean­ing­less en­deav­our, and the econ­omy is deemed non-ex­is­tent. The Sec­ond Republic had in­her­ited con­flict is­sues, such as the emo­tive Guku­rahundi, which had con­tin­ued to deny the na­tion peace­ful co-ex­is­tence over the past three decades. The NPRC has been play­ing its role as man­dated by the Constitution, to unite Zimbabwe for sus­tain­able peace by de­vel­op­ing mech­a­nisms for re­solv­ing vi­o­lent con­flicts of the past and present and pre­vent­ing their re­cur­rence. Un­der the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, the Sec­ond Republic had made re-en­gage­ment one of its key pri­or­i­ties and had es­tab­lished a plat­form for di­a­logue with po­lit­i­cal par­ties, churches and civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions, to put clo­sure to past con­flicts, par­tic­u­larly the Guku­rahundi is­sue. The is­suance of birth and death cer­tifi­cates for Guku­rahundi vic­tims had also been given pri­or­ity through leg­isla­tive in­put. In Fe­bru­ary this year, the NPRC started a train­ing pro­gramme for pro­vin­cial peace com­mit­tees as part of its con­sti­tu­tional man­date. The com­mit­tees were set up last year, with every com­mis­sioner su­per­in­tend­ing a com­mit­tee of be­tween 25 and 30 mem­bers. Democ­racy The Sec­ond Republic opened up spa­ces for con­struc­tive di­a­logue aimed at thwart­ing pol­i­tics of neg­a­tiv­ity. Po­lit­i­cal neg­a­tiv­ity feeds into pol­i­tics of sub­terfuge, where Western ide­olo­gies are ad­vanced at the ex­pense of the na­tional in­ter­est. Re­gard­ing Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s com­mit­ment to con­struc­tive di­a­logue through POLAD, Bethel Chris­tian Party leader Dr Wil­lard Ta­wonezvi Mu­gadza said: “Un­der the Sec­ond Republic, we have an op­por­tu­nity, as op­po­si­tion po­lit­i­cal par­ties, to move away from Western type op­po­si­tion ide­ol­ogy that is meant to cre­ate neg­a­tive po­lit­i­cal en­ergy in the coun­try. “We must, as op­po­si­tion po­lit­i­cal par­ties, cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment where the Gov­ern­ment is will­ing to engage con­struc­tively and re­spect­fully with us. That way, our sug­ges­tions on is­sues of na­tion-build­ing can be con­sid­ered favourably.” The Con­sti­tu­tional Court notched a num­ber of mile­stones since its es­tab­lish­ment, chief among them be­ing the su­pe­rior court’s sit­ting in Au­gust 2018 to con­sider sub­mis­sions by MDC-Al­liance pres­i­den­tial con­tes­tant Nel­son Chamisa in chal­lenge to his loss to Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa in the July 30, 2018 har­monised elec­tions. The chal­lenge marked a new tra­jec­tory in Zim­bab­wean pol­i­tics in as far as open­ing up of po­lit­i­cal space is con­cerned. That Chamisa en­joyed the free­dom to re­duce the ma­jor­ity vote of the cit­i­zens of Zimbabwe to a Con­sti­tu­tional Court Bench vote, in the full glare of global lenses is tes­ti­mony to Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s com­mit­ment to the re­build­ing of the great na­tion of Zimbabwe. Like any other Zim­bab­wean, Chamisa ex­er­cised his con­sti­tu­tional right to refuse de­feat so that jus­tice could be the ul­ti­mate win­ner. With the court of pub­lic opin­ion in situ, the Bench led by Chief Jus­tice Luke Mal­aba, car­ried the day for its learned and sober in­ter­pre­ta­tion of facts to put to rest a na­tion’s anx­i­ety, and re­fash­ion as­pi­ra­tions for that Golden Fu­ture Time Zim­bab­weans have all been yearn­ing for. Re-en­gage­ment ef­forts Like any other coun­try, Zimbabwe’s for­eign pol­icy en­deav­ours to ad­vance the coun­try’s pol­icy ob­jec­tives on the global arena. Alive to the fact that na­tional in­ter­ests are the ful­crum of any coun­try’s for­eign pol­icy as they drive its con­cep­tion, Zimbabwe’s (for­eign pol­icy) is an ex­ten­sion of its do­mes­tic pol­icy. The Sec­ond Republic ad­vo­cates en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment as a way of push­ing for out­comes where the com­mon good is the ul­ti­mate win­ner. In 2018, Zimbabwe’s premier in­vest­ment pro­mo­tion body, Zimbabwe In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity (ZIA), re­vealed that it re­ceived 165 busi­ness ap­pli­ca­tions worth US$15,8 bil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and June of the same year. In April 2018, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa led a del­e­ga­tion of 10 Cabi­net min­is­ters and about 80 busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives to China, as the new ad­min­is­tra­tion an­gled for op­por­tu­ni­ties in an ef­fort to but­tress ways to turn­around the econ­omy, which has been un­der stress for the past two decades or so. The Pres­i­dent out­lined his noble in­ten­tions then when he said: “The is­sue is not only about at­tract­ing cap­i­tal into Zimbabwe. It’s an is­sue of leapfrog­ging af­ter 18 years of iso­la­tion so that we catch up with the rest of the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.” The re­cip­ro­cal visit by a del­e­ga­tion of 60 Chi­nese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and pri­vate busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives to Harare in June 2018, led by the Sec­re­tary of Zhe­jiang Pro­vin­cial Com­mit­tee of the Com­mu­nist Party of China (CPC) and Chair­man of the stand­ing com­mit­tee of Zhe­jiang’s Pro­vin­cial Peo­ple’s Congress Mr Che Jun, ahead of the Zimbabwe-China Fo­rum, to scout for busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties, was a huge step to­wards win-win out­comes. In March 2019, the two prin­ci­pals to the Third Ses­sion of the Zimbabwe-South Africa Bi-Na­tional Com­mis­sion Sum­mit held in Harare, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa and his coun­ter­part Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa, signed an agree­ment to ac­cel­er­ate im­ple­men­ta­tion of 45 Me­moranda of Un­der­stand­ing (MOUs) cut­ting across var­i­ous sec­tors of the econ­omy, From April 29, 1994, bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries took a new di­men­sion meant to push for­ward the as­pi­ra­tions of the peo­ples of Zimbabwe and South Africa through fos­ter­ing win-win out­comes. Be­yond shar­ing geo­graph­i­cal prox­im­ity, Zimbabwe and South Africa are top trad­ing part­ners. Ac­cord­ing to the Zimbabwe Na­tional Sta­tis­tics Agency (Zim­stats), Zimbabwe im­ported goods worth $6,3 bil­lion be­tween Fe­bru­ary and De­cem­ber 2018, up from $4,9 bil­lion in the prior year. Dur­ing the same pe­riod the coun­try’s ex­ports stood at $3,9 bil­lion, leav­ing a trade deficit of $2,4 bil­lion. A trade deficit of such a mag­ni­tude, how­ever, needs to be worked on. Also, the na­ture of ex­ports ex­poses an­other chal­lenge; the ex­ports are mostly un­pro­cessed raw ma­te­ri­als. There is an ur­gent need for ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion across all sec­tors. With the coun­try an­gling for a mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030 sup­ported by the eco­nomic blue­print, Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP), the im­ple­men­ta­tion of 45 agree­ments be­tween Zimbabwe and South Africa in ex­is­tence on pa­per for some time, will not only add value to the coun­try’s ex­ports, but will re­vive the man­u­fac­tur­ing, min­ing and agri­cul­tural sec­tors, among oth­ers. Job cre­ation, re­vamp­ing of in­dus­try In 2018 Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa com­mis­sioned a US$30 mil­lion state-of-the-art bot­tling plant at Varun Bev­er­ages Zimbabwe’s premises in Harare. The sec­ond phase of the man­u­fac­tur­ing plant was of­fi­cially opened in De­cem­ber 2019 at a cost of US$20 mil­lion. The ad­di­tional lines to the plant con­sid­er­ably in­creased pro­duc­tion lev­els. Varun Bev­er­ages, the largest bot­tler of Pep­siCo prod­ucts — Pepsi, Mirinda, Moun­tain Dew and Seven-Up out­side the United States of Amer­ica, em­ploys over 1 000 peo­ple, and has em­pow­ered 1 500 women through al­lo­ca­tion of vend­ing trol­leys. About 20 000 re­tail­ers and ven­dors have ac­cess to Pepsi prod­ucts across the coun­try, and close to 22 000 fam­i­lies ben­e­fit di­rectly or in­di­rectly from the com­pany. An­other ma­jor in­vest­ment that came to the ben­e­fit of Zim­bab­weans in the past two years is the US$120 mil­lion tile man­u­fac­tur­ing plant in Nor­ton. Sunny Yi Feng Tiles (Zimbabwe) opened its pro­duc­tion lines in May, 2019. The com­pany op­er­ates three fac­to­ries that make tiles, print card­board boxes for pack­ag­ing them and of­fer lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port. With an in­stalled ca­pac­ity of 35 000 square me­tres of tiles per day, Sunny Yi Feng em­ploys 1 000 peo­ple — 800 Zim­bab­wean cit­i­zens and 200 Chi­nese na­tion­als. A fur­ther 600 jobs will be cre­ated when full ca­pac­ity is reached. An­other in­di­ca­tor that Zimbabwe was a des­ti­na­tion of choice to in­vestors was re­splen­dent at the 60th edition of the Zimbabwe In­ter­na­tional Trade Fair (ZITF), which ran un­der the theme “Prop­a­gat­ing In­dus­trial Growth through Trade and In­vest­ment” in 2019, when space was sold out for the first time since in­cep­tion in 1959 forc­ing or­gan­is­ers to pitch up tents. The space avail­able for sale rose from 47 612 square me­tres in 2016 to 57 732 square me­tres in 2019. In­roads have also been made to­wards ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion of hor­ti­cul­tural prod­ucts through Gov­ern­ment sup­port to com­pa­nies in that sec­tor, and the re­sus­ci­ta­tion of the na­tional herd. Chin­hoyi Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy launched an Ar­ti­fi­cial Insem­i­na­tion Pro­gramme that can yield US$140 mil­lion, which can go a long way in grow­ing the na­tional herd, em­pow­er­ing farm­ers and boost­ing the coun­try’s for­eign cur­rency cof­fers. In Zimbabwe, the ar­ti­sanal and small-scale min­ing sec­tor has been a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor to the to­tal gold out­put, hence, the Sec­ond Republic’s ef­forts to rope the sec­tor in to curb stig­ma­ti­sa­tion. Ac­cord­ing to Fidelity Prin­ters and Re­fin­ers, the sec­tor ac­counted for 22 of the 34 tonnes of gold pro­duced in 2018, rep­re­sent­ing a 65 per­cent con­tri­bu­tion. Gold ex­ports con­trib­uted US$1,33 bil­lion in the same year. To at­tract for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, the Gov­ern­ment re­laxed share­hold­ing reg­u­la­tions for min­ing oper­a­tions. For­eign in­vestors are now al­lowed to own 100 per­cent share­hold­ing in all min­eral ven­tures ex­cept for plat­inum and di­a­monds. In joint ven­tures for di­a­mond and plat­inum min­ing the Gov­ern­ment is en­ti­tled to 51 per­cent while the for­eign in­vestor would get 49 per­cent share­hold­ing. The US$4,2 Karo Re­sources project of­fi­cially launched by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa in 2018 is an­other mile­stone to cel­e­brate. The con­sol­i­dated plat­inum project in Mhon­doro-Mubaira is set to cre­ate a com­bined 90 000 jobs. The first 15 000 jobs will come di­rectly from em­ploy­ment by Karo Re­sources, while 75 000 will be cre­ated through sec­ondary and ter­tiary in­dus­tries when the project reaches its peak by 2023. The in­vestor will also es­tab­lish a power plant with a 600 megawatt ca­pac­ity, enough to drive the mine and con­trib­ute the sur­plus to the na­tional grid. The min­istry also made strides to­wards the re­sus­ci­ta­tion of Delta Gold’s Eureka Mine in Gu­ruve which is ex­pected to at­tain its pro­duc­tion tar­get of two tonnes of gold by 2021, af­ter Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa re-com­mis­sioned the mine in 2018. In line with the na­tional Vi­sion 2030, the coun­try tar­gets to hit 100-tonne gold pro­duc­tion by 2023, and achieve its mis­sion to have a sta­ble and sus­tain­able US$12 bil­lion min­ing in­dus­try by the same year. In ad­di­tion the multi-bil­lion Ar­ca­dia Lithium Project, launched by the Pres­i­dent in 2019, and ex­pected to go into pro­duc­tion within 18 months will also go a long way in cre­at­ing em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for Zim­bab­weans and grow the econ­omy. In Jan­uary 2020, Great Dyke In­vest­ments be­gan min­ing on its Dar­wen­dale con­ces­sions af­ter years of prepa­ra­tion. The US$2 bil­lion project is a joint ven­ture be­tween Rus­sia’s Vi Hold­ings and Zimbabwe’s Lan­dela Min­ing Ven­ture Pvt Ltd. The US$1,1 bil­lion Hwange ven­ture is the largest project un­der the mile­stone deals signed be­tween Zimbabwe and China, and is ex­pected to feed 600 megawatts into the na­tional grid — eas­ing the coun­try’s power chal­lenges. The main con­trac­tor ex­e­cut­ing the Hwange 7 and 8 power ex­pan­sion, Si­no­hy­dro in­di­cates the project is 40 per­cent com­plete. The project has pro­vided em­ploy­ment for 1 812 lo­cals. The Zimbabwe Con­sol­i­dated Di­a­mond Com­pany is pro­jected to in­crease pro­duc­tion to 10 mil­lion carats worth about US$1 bil­lion by 2023. Zimbabwe is rich in min­er­als, some of which are: gold, sil­ver, plat­inum group met­als (PGMs) con­sist­ing of plat­inum, pal­la­dium, rhodium, ruthe­nium, irid­ium and os­mium; di­a­monds, chrome, coal, nickel, as­bestos, coal bed meth­ane, cop­per, iron, peg­matite (tan­ta­lite, tin and wol­framite, beryl, mica, feldspar, gem­stones such as emer­ald, aqua­ma­rine, chrysoberyl, alexan­drite and eu­clase), and di­men­sion stones (Gran­ites, gneisses, migmatites, gab­bro-norites, do­lerite, mar­bles and quartzites). The coun­try has the sec­ond largest high grade chromium ores in the world af­ter South Africa, with re­serves of ap­prox­i­mately 10 bil­lion tonnes. Strides have also been made to­wards ca­pac­i­ta­tion of the fer­tiliser man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor. The Gov­ern­ment has adopted the Five Year Fer­tiliser Im­port Sub­sti­tu­tion with nearly US$80 mil­lion hav­ing been in­vested to ca­pac­i­tate lo­cal firms; Sable Chem­i­cals and Chemplex Phos­phates. The de­vel­op­ment would see prices of am­mo­nium ni­trate fer­tiliser de­clin­ing by an av­er­age 28 per­cent over the next four years, from the cur­rent US$25 per 50kg bag to US$18, the price of phos­phates is ex­pected to drop to US$9,25 from US$13. ◆ Read full ar­ti­cle on www.herald.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160413,Zim@36: Time to de­cen­tralise,"much more ca­pa­ble to gen­er­ate em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties than a cen­tralised one in that its de­ci­sions are from the grass­roots whereas the cen­tralised sys­tem’s de­ci­sions are from the top. A so­cio – eco­nomic devel­op­ment process orig­i­nat­ing in ei­ther a vil­lage or a ward or dis­trict is much more likely to suc­ceed and to ben­e­fit its par­tic­u­lar area eco­nom­i­cally from the time it is a con­cept up to its op­er­a­tional stage more than one orig­i­nat­ing away from the com­mu­nity of its lo­ca­tion. Such devel­op­ment projects use a lo­cal labour force whose earn­ings ben­e­fit the vil­lage, ward or dis­trict, thus con­tribut­ing to­wards poverty erad­i­ca­tion. So­cio – eco­nomic devel­op­ment is much faster in a de­cen­tralised gov­ern­ment sys­tem be­cause de­ci­sions are taken and im­ple­mented much faster than in cen­tralised governance where bu­reau­cratic de­lays and other hitches are in­evitable from the con­cep­tion to the im­ple­men­ta­tion stages. De­cen­tralised governance has two types of re­sults, eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment and po­lit­i­cal em­pow­er­ment. It au­tho­rises lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties to iden­tify and ex­ploit their own nat­u­ral re­sources, and to de­velop their lo­cal or re­gional in­fra­struc­ture such as in­ter – dis­trict and in­ter – pro­vin­cial roads, pri­mary and sec­ondary schools, lo­cal med­i­cal, sports and cul­tural fa­cil­i­ties. The iden­ti­fi­ca­tion and devel­op­ment of hu­man re­sources are much more achieved in a de­cen­tralised governance sys­tem than in a cen­tralised one. Po­lit­i­cal em­pow­er­ment of the masses is eas­ier achieved in a de­cen­tralised than in a cen­tralised governance frame­work in that in the for­mer, peo­ple are given or del­e­gated the au­thor­ity to de­cide as well as to put their de­ci­sions into ef­fect. A sense of na­tional be­long­ing and loy­alty (pa­tri­o­tism) is cer­tainly much stronger in a de­cen­tralised than in a cen­tralised sit­u­a­tion. Com­mu­ni­ties be­come more loyal to the state when they are given more re­spon­si­bil­ity in their re­spec­tive ar­eas, and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties are, of course, much more eas­ily car­ried out when peo­ple have both the po­lit­i­cal and le­gal au­thor­ity to do so. It is im­por­tant to bear in mind that politics is ba­si­cally all about space and power. Space refers to ge­o­graph­i­cal ar­eas of abode. Those ar­eas have both hu­man and nat­u­ral re­sources that have to be de­vel­oped and ex­ploited. To do that ef­fec­tively, com­mu­ni­ties have to be legally em­pow­ered. The best way to do so is by de­volv­ing power to them so that they be­come masters of their own des­tiny. We should un­der­stand that their cen­tral­i­sa­tion and de­cen­tral­i­sa­tion are re­ally not op­po­site governance ten­den­cies, but are, in fact, the same governance ten­den­cies that dif­fer only in the method and de­gree of their re­spec­tive dis­per­sal of power and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to the peo­ple. It is of his­tor­i­cal in­ter­est to ob­serve here that some of the world’s most ad­mired so­cio – eco­nom­i­cally suc­cess­ful na­tions have de­cen­tralised governance sys­tems. Among those na­tions we can men­tion Canada, Aus­tralia, the United States, In­dia, and one or two South Amer­i­can states. Our south­ern neigh­bour, South Africa, is another na­tion with such a governance. One of the world’s emerg­ing eco­nomic gi­ants, China, has a de­cen­tralised governance al­beit in the eco­nomic and fis­cal sec­tors. Switzer­land is yet another won­der­ful ex­am­ple of a state run by a de­cen­tralised gov­ern­ment sys­tem. The au­thor of this ar­ti­cle has used the words “governance” and “gov­ern­ment” more or less in­ter – change­ably in this opin­ion piece. To clear pos­si­ble con­fu­sion the au­thor wishes to de­fine “governance” by quot­ing a 1997 United Na­tions Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme (UNDP) state­ment on that topic: “….. governance can be de­fined as the ex­er­cise",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20160304,In­vestors fear bad poli­cies,"FOR­MER United States Sec­re­tary of State and Chair­man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff re­tired Gen­eral Colin Pow­ell once de­scribed cap­i­tal as a coward, in­di­cat­ing at­tract­ing in­vest­ment is not easy un­less there is an en­abling en­vi­ron­ment. “At­tract­ing money isn’t easy. Cap­i­tal is a coward. It flees from cor­rup­tion and bad poli­cies, con­flict and un­pre­dictabil­ity. It shuns ig­no­rance, dis­ease and il­lit­er­acy,” Pow­ell said. “Cap­i­tal goes where it is wel­comed and where in­vestors can be con­fi­dent of a re­turn on the re­sources they have put at risk. It goes to coun­tries where women can work, chil­dren can read, and en­trepreneurs can dream.” Pow­ell fur­ther in­di­cated coun­tries that have opened their economies have done bet­ter than those that re­main closed. Cit­ing a World Bank study over a decade ago, he said that over the course of the 1990s 24 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries that in­creased global trade and in­vest­ment the most also in­creased in­come per per­son much more than those that did not. In those coun­tries, he con­tin­ued, the num­ber of peo­ple liv­ing on less than US$1 per day dropped by 120 mil­lion be­tween 1993 and 1998. “But good poli­cies alone are not enough. Peo­ple must be able to seize the op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he added, say­ing gov­ern­ments, civil so­ci­ety and the pri­vate sec­tor must work in part­ner­ship to mo­bilise de­vel­op­ment re­sources to un­leash hu­man pro­duc­tiv­ity, foster sus­tain­able growth and re­duce poverty. Well over a decade later, his mes­sage de­liv­ered ahead of the 2002 World Sum­mit on Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment just across Zim­babwe’s south­ern bor­der in Jo­han­nes­burg, South Africa, seems to be even more rel­e­vant to this coun­try. In this edi­tion, we re­port on Page 4 that a to­tal of 80 del­e­ga­tions vis­ited Zim­babwe last year to ex­plore in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties but their mis­sions did not yield the de­sired re­sults. Del­e­ga­tions from many coun­tries and trad­ing blocs like the Euro­pean Union — in­clud­ing Bri­tain, Ger­many and France — the United States, Scan­di­na­vian coun­tries, China and Rus­sia, among oth­ers, vis­ited Zim­babwe, but they chose not to in­vest here. In­vestors did not come back to the coun­try as they felt it has a hos­tile busi­ness cli­mate and high risk. Most of the prob­lems dis­cour­ag­ing in­vest­ment in Zim­babwe in­clude political un­cer­tainty, pol­icy un­pre­dictabil­ity and bu­reau­cratic ob­sta­cles, as well as tram­pling on prop­erty rights, the rule of law and hu­man rights. Bad lead­er­ship, in­com­pe­tence and cor­rup­tion do not help the sit­u­a­tion. Africa’s rich­est man Aliko Dan­gote also vis­ited Zim­babwe to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties, but com­plained about the coun­try’s re­stric­tive visa regime. Zim­babwe has re­peat­edly ranked poorly in each and ev­ery Do­ing Busi­ness Sur­vey by the World Bank and the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum. Com­pared to its neigh­bours, Zim­babwe got a pal­try US$545 mil­lion in FDI in 2014 while Mozam­bique re­ceived US$4,9 bil­lion, nearly nine times more, pace­set­ter South Africa US$5,7 bil­lion and Zam­bia US$2,4 bil­lion.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160428,Home­grown so­lu­tions key to eco­nomic re­vival,"ZIM­BABWE has the po­ten­tial to be­come a key eco­nomic gi­ant if it adopts home­grown so­lu­tions and fi­nalises on-go­ing ease of do­ing busi­ness re­forms, a Cab­i­net Min­is­ter said yes­ter­day. Speak­ing dur­ing the In­ter­na­tional Busi­ness Con­fer­ence in Bu­l­awayo, Macro-eco­nomic Plan­ning and In­vest­ment Pro­mo­tion Min­is­ter Obert Mpofu said this would en­hance the reg­u­la­tory and op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment for in­vestors. “The coun­try has a po­ten­tial to be­come a key eco­nomic gi­ant. In­no­va­tion, in­te­gra­tion and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion are crit­i­cal for any econ­omy to thrive as these fac­tors en­able economies to adapt to the dy­namic global en­vi­ron­ment through adop­tion of home­grown so­lu­tions while at the same time learn­ing from in­ter­na­tional best prac­tice,” Mpofu said. “These fac­tors go a long way in ad­dress­ing the poverty scourge be­dev­il­ing many African coun­tries through em­ploy­ment cre­ation and tech­nol­ogy trans­fer. “The coun­try is also un­der­tak­ing Do­ing Busi­ness Re­forms to fur­ther en­hance the reg­u­la­tory, pol­icy and op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment for in­vestors. This will make it more con­ve­nient for any in­vestor to set up shop and op­er­ate in Zim­babwe.” Min­is­ter Mpofu said the coun­try needs to be com­pet­i­tive to at­tract in­ter­na­tional cap­i­tal. He said this was the rea­son why the gov­ern­ment is es­tab­lish­ing Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones (SEZs) to of­fer su­pe­rior in­cen­tives to in­vestors op­er­at­ing in these des­ig­nated geo­graph­i­cal re­gions. “This is meant to fur­ther im­prove the in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment and to har­ness for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment into strate­gic sec­tors of the econ­omy, which are vi­tal for the turn­around of the econ­omy. “SEZs have suc­ceeded in China and in other African coun­tries such as Ethiopia. They’ve trans­formed in­dus­tries and at­tracted new cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy. These go be­yond the Ex­port Pro­cess­ing Zones, which fo­cus mainly on in­creas­ing ex­ports,” he said. Min­is­ter Mpofu said in or­der to ad­dress the op­er­a­tional hur­dles pre­vi­ously faced by in­vestors, his min­istry has held con­sul­ta­tions with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers to come up with mea­sures to en­hance the Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness. Speak­ing at the same oc­ca­sion, the Deputy Chief Sec­re­tary to the Pres­i­dent and Cab­i­net, Ray Ndhlukula, said the gov­ern­ment has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in achiev­ing the Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness Re­forms. “When com­pared to other coun­tries, the time taken to start a new busi­ness in Zim­babwe was too long. It used to take 90 days to ful­fil nine pro­ce­dures to start a new busi­ness. All these pro­ce­dures are now gone as the time taken to start a new busi­ness has been re­duced to 30 days. “Pro­posed amend­ments to var­i­ous pieces of leg­is­la­tion that in­clude the Com­pa­nies Act have also been made. An MoU was signed to con­sol­i­date the pay­ment of taxes to Zimra, Zimdef and NSSA through the adop­tion of a sin­gle win­dow to re­duce the time taken by busi­ness in mak­ing these pay­ments. We’re hop­ing that you (busi­ness) will do it on-line so that you don’t move out of your of­fices,” he said. Ndhlukula said the gov­ern­ment was im­ple­ment­ing the Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness Re­forms to im­prove the in­vest­ment cli­mate in Zim­babwe for both lo­cal and for­eign in­vestors. This, he said, is part of ac­cel­er­ated im­ple­men­ta­tion of the gov­ern­ment’s eco­nomic blue print, Zim-As­set. The Ease of Do­ing Busi­ness Re­forms that were launched in Septem­ber last year are aimed at sim­pli­fy­ing busi­ness pro­ce­dures as some of the laws that the coun­try is us­ing are ar­chaic.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20151002,Key val­ues im­per­a­tive for eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion,"OVER the last month we have looked closely at the progress, op­por­tu­ni­ties and chal­lenges in other African coun­tries. We have learnt some valu­able lessons from the eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion that is cur­rently tak­ing place across Africa. Eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion agen­das by gov­ern­ments all over the world have al­ways been de­ployed as a means of trans­form­ing the lives of their cit­i­zens. The story of mod­ern China’s as­cen­sion to be­come a global eco­nomic world power started with the eco­nomic re­forms of chair­man Mao Ze­dong in 1949 which were later con­sol­i­dated by Deng Xiaop­ing’s the­ory of a “So­cial­ist Mar­ket Econ­omy”. China’s rapid eco­nomic growth in the 1980s and 1990s was largely cred­ited to Deng’s so­cioe­co­nomic model of a po­lit­i­cal mar­ket econ­omy. Over the last decade, China has been one of the fastest grow­ing economies in the world and is ex­pected to over­take the US as the world’s largest econ­omy by 2020, ac­cord­ing to Mar­ket Watch. Since the mid-1990s many subSa­ha­ran African coun­tries have seen solid eco­nomic growth buoyed by re­forms in macro-eco­nomic man­age­ment, im­prove­ments in the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and high com­mod­ity prices. Ris­ing in­comes are sup­port­ing the emer­gence of an African mid­dle class and young Africans are now much more likely to re­turn home to pur­sue a ca­reer af­ter an ed­u­ca­tion abroad. To en­sure that growth is sus­tain­able and con­tin­ues to im­prove the lives of the ma­jor­ity of their cit­i­zens, coun­tries now need to vig­or­ously pro­mote eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. Growth so far has come from macro-eco­nomic re­forms, bet­ter busi­ness en­vi­ron­ments and higher com­mod­ity prices. But eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion re­quires much more. Coun­tries have to di­ver­sify their pro­duc­tion and ex­ports. They have to be­come more com­pet­i­tive on in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. They have to in­crease the pro­duc­tiv­ity of all re­source in­puts, es­pe­cially labour, and they have to up­grade tech­nolo­gies they use in pro­duc­tion. Only by do­ing so can they en­sure that growth im­proves hu­man well-be­ing by pro­vid­ing more pro­duc­tive jobs and higher in­comes and thus al­low ev­ery­one to share in the new pros­per­ity. Ac­cord­ing to the African Cen­tre for Eco­nomic Trans­for­ma­tion (Acet), what African coun­tries need is more diver­si­fi­ca­tion, ex­port com­pet­i­tive­ness, in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity, tech­no­log­i­cal up­grad­ing and im­prove­ments in hu­man well-be­ing or in short Depth. Gov­ern­ment, pri­vate sec­tor, work­ers, media and civil so­ci­ety all have mu­tu­ally re­in­forc­ing roles in pro­mot­ing eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. Pri­vate firms — for­eign and lo­cal, for­mal and in­for­mal — should take the lead in pro­duc­ing and dis­tribut­ing goods and ser­vices, in up­grad­ing tech­nolo­gies and pro­duc­tion pro­cesses and in ex­pand­ing the op­por­tu­ni­ties for pro­duc­tive em­ploy­ment. How­ever, they must be fa­cil­i­tated by a gov­ern­ment that has strong ca­pa­bil­i­ties in set­ting an over­all eco­nomic vi­sion and strat­egy, pro­vid­ing ef­fi­cient sup­port­ive in­fra­struc­ture and ser­vices, main­tain­ing a reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment con­ducive to en­tre­pre­neur­ial ac­tiv­ity and fa­cil­i­tat­ing the ac­qui­si­tion of new tech­nolo­gies and the ca­pa­bil­i­ties to pro­duce new goods and ser­vices and ac­cess new for­eign mar­kets. Sim­i­larly, gov­ern­ment can gain much from hav­ing firms and en­trepreneurs weigh in on set­ting a na­tional eco­nomic vi­sion and strat­egy — on de­sign­ing poli­cies, in­vest­ments, and in­cen­tives to sup­port that strat­egy. Strong third-party mech­a­nisms of ac­count­abil­ity can draw in par­lia­ments, in­de­pen­dent media, aca­demics, think-tanks and civil so­ci­ety to en­sure that close col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween of­fi­cials and firms does in­deed sup­port eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. The African Union’s 2063 Agenda calls for the re­gion’s economies to in­te­grate and to join the global econ­omy. This will re­quire de­vel­op­ing hu­man cap­i­tal through ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, es­pe­cially in science, tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion. It will also re­quire ac­cel­er­at­ing in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment to link African economies and peo­ple by meet­ing the tar­gets set for energy, trans­port and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies. It will also re­quire fos­ter­ing mean­ing­ful part­ner­ships with the pri­vate sec­tor. Many African economies are grow­ing faster than they have in 40 years. Six of the world’s 10 fastest grow­ing coun­tries in the 2000s were in SubSa­ha­ran Africa: An­gola at 11,1% a year, Nige­ria 8,9%, Ethiopia 8,4%, Chad 7,9%, Mozam­bique 7,9%, and Rwanda 7,6%. And sev­eral oth­ers were above or near the 7% growth needed to dou­ble their economies in 10 years. Be­hind the growth are the im­ple­men­ta­tion of bet­ter eco­nomic poli­cies, end of decades-long debt cri­sis, high com­mod­ity prices and ris­ing dis­cov­ery and ex­ports of oil, gas, and min­er­als, and the ben­e­fi­cial im­pact of new in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nolo­gies. How­ever, the struc­ture of most sub-Sa­ha­ran African economies has not changed much over the past 40 years. Pro­duc­tion and ex­ports are still based on a nar­row range of com­modi­ties and the share of man­u­fac­tur­ing in pro­duc­tion and ex­ports re­mains rel­a­tively low, as do the lev­els of tech­nol­ogy and pro­duc­tiv­ity across economies. On global mar­kets, African coun­tries gen­er­ally find it a chal­lenge to com­pete, ex­cept in pri­mary agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties and ex­trac­tives. And the lev­els of vul­ner­a­ble and in­for­mal em­ploy­ment are high — around 80% in many coun­tries — which trans­late to high poverty lev­els with around 50% of the pop­u­la­tion liv­ing on less than US$1,25 a day. Pur­su­ing eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion or growth with Depth agenda is there­fore im­per­a­tive for African coun­tries. Zim­babwe has lagged be­hind the rest of Africa, dra­mat­i­cally, in terms of eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. We have failed to di­ver­sify our econ­omy over the last 20 years: pro­duc­tiv­ity has de­clined with many in­dus­tries still col­laps­ing; there has been lim­ited tech­no­log­i­cal im­prove­ments es­pe­cially in in­dus­try; and the stan­dard of liv­ing has de­clined in Zim­babwe over the last two decades.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191109,Govt ups de­vo­lu­tion bud­getary al­lo­ca­tion,"GOV­ERN­MENT has in­creased the bud­getary al­lo­ca­tion for de­vo­lu­tion to en­sure an im­prove­ment in ser­vice de­liv­ery across Zim­babwe, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said yes­ter­day. Speak­ing as he com­mis­sioned 76 Zupco buses in Bu­l­awayo, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa called on lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to take ad­van­tage of this rise to iden­tify and prioritise their de­vel­op­ment needs. “My Gov­ern­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to the full im­ple­men­ta­tion of de­vo­lu­tion. My Min­is­ter of Fi­nance, who is here, Hon­ourable Mthuli Ncube, is in­creas­ing bud­getary al­lo­ca­tions to­wards de­vo­lu­tion, which means there will be more fund­ing made avail­able to prov­inces, ru­ral district coun­cils and ur­ban coun­cils in or­der to as­sist you to in­crease ser­vice de­liv­ery,” he said. “There­fore, com­mu­ni­ties, ur­ban and ru­ral, must take full ad­van­tage of this de­vel­op­ment and prioritise your var­i­ous de­vel­op­ment needs. “You must be able, at the lo­cal com­mu­nity level, to iden­tify your re­spec­tive com­mu­nity needs and prioritise them. We will sup­port you with fund­ing.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa called for co­he­sion be­tween lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and the Gov­ern­ment. “I urge lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to al­ways work with Gov­ern­ment in unity for the good of our na­tion and all our peo­ple. We are stronger when we are united.” The Pres­i­dent warned that of­fi­cials who en­gage in cor­rupt ac­tiv­i­ties would face the law. “How­ever, I warn those run­ning ru­ral district coun­cils and ur­ban coun­cils to shun cor­rup­tion. If you shun cor­rup­tion, I will shun re­mov­ing you. Oth­er­wise those who en­gage in cor­rup­tion, with me we part ways,” he said. The Gov­ern­ment al­lo­cated the funds to be shared among the 10 prov­inces based on a num­ber of fac­tors such as poverty lev­els in all ru­ral dis­tricts, qual­ity of in­fra­struc­ture and size of pop­u­la­tion. Last month, Prof Ncube said the Gov­ern­ment would dis­burse the re­main­ing $ 417 mil­lion from this year’s de­vo­lu­tion al­lo­ca­tion of $ 703 mil­lion to coun­cils within two months. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa urged lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to re­ha­bil­i­tate and con­struct mod­ern and com­ple­men­tary in­fra­struc­ture such as bus ter­mi­nuses and bus stops to en­sure safety, time­li­ness, ef­fi­ciency and con­ve­nience to the com­mut­ing pub­lic. “I equally urge the var­i­ous stake­hold­ers to adopt mod­ern tech­nolo­gies to min­imise leak­ages and op­ti­mise op­er­a­tions in the im­ple­men­ta­tion of this pro­gramme,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. Mean­while, the Pres­i­dent urged trav­ellers to keep the buses clean. He said ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties in Mata­bele­land re­gion will start ben­e­fit­ing from sub­sidised Zupco ser­vices as the 76 buses en­ter ser­vice with most ex­pected to ply routes in Mata­bele­land North and South prov­inces. The Pres­i­dent said the fleet is ex­pected to go a long way to­wards re­vamp­ing the pub­lic trans­port de­liv­ery sys­tem and re­duce the high trans­port costs in both ru­ral and ur­ban ar­eas. “These buses have a sub­sidy by Gov­ern­ment, so they will re­main cheap. This pro­gramme at­tests to my Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment and de­ter­mi­na­tion to im­prove the qual­ity of life of the or­di­nary peo­ple in line with our vi­sion to be­come a mid­dle- in­come so­ci­ety by 2030. “In this re­gard, we are de­ter­mined to en­sure that our de­vel­op­men­tal pro­grammes leave no one be­hind,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said it is the Gov­ern­ment’s vi­sion to have an ef­fi­cient, re­li­able, safe and af­ford­able trans­port sec­tor. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said the coun­try is go­ing to have in ex­cess of 1 500 buses brought from China, Be­larus and South Africa. “Some of the buses are from Be­larus. Of the 500 com­ing from Be­larus, 300, we have agreed, will come to Zim­babwe as knocked down kits to be as­sem­bled here lo­cally to pro­vide em­ploy­ment,” said the Pres­i­dent. He said Zupco is presently fer­ry­ing more than 300 000 com­muters to var­i­ous des­ti­na­tions each day across Zim­babwe. “To­day we are com­mis­sion­ing an ad­di­tional 76 buses as I speak, the de­liv­ery of the bal­ance of the buses is on­go­ing, they are al­ready over 76 be­cause oth­ers are on the road com­ing. Act­ing Zupco chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mr Evaristo Madan­gwa said they are of­fer­ing af­ford­able trans­port ser­vices in Harare, Bu­l­awayo, Masvingo, Mutare, Kwekwe, Gweru, Chin­hoyi, Gokwe and re­cently in Chiredzi. “We are set to re- open our Gwanda and Hwange de­pots and com­mence op­er­a­tions in those towns. These out­ly­ing de­pots will be our spring­board for reach­ing out to re­mote ru­ral ar­eas,” he said. Sig­nif­i­cant progress has been made in re- open­ing dor­mant de­pots like Karoi, Rusape and Kariba. “We are on tar­get to reach the tar­get fleet size hav­ing se­cured 312 com­muter om­nibuses to date of which 80 of those om­nibuses are ply­ing Bu­l­awayo routes. We have got 507 buses coun­try­wide,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20150924,SDGs: Will they make a dif­fer­ence?,"THIS week Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe and other heads of state as­sem­ble in New York to launch the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. The agreed text lays out 17 goals and 169 tar­gets. It is an am­bi­tious agenda for all of hu­man­ity. But will they make any dif­fer­ence? We have had the Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals (MDGs), which were launched with sim­i­lar fanfare in 2000. These fo­cused on “de­vel­op­ment” and “poverty”, but were sim­i­larly high-sound­ing. Pro­moted heav­ily by Jeff Sachs, bed nets, vac­cines and agri­cul­tural tech­nolo­gies were go­ing to save the world. Big money from in­ter­na­tional donors and phi­lan­thropists came be­hind them, but did they make a dif­fer­ence? I must con­fess I was a deep cynic in 2000. The “aid” frame of the MDGs meant that im­ple­men­ta­tion was sub­ject to the usual top-down im­po­si­tions, and there were many lim­i­ta­tions, with the added bur­den of the targe­to­ri­ented au­dit cul­ture, and all the dis­tor­tions this cre­ates. Was aid go­ing to be a saviour or just a stick­ing plas­ter, un­able to ad­dress the real struc­tural causes of poverty and in­equal­ity? Did the MDGs just re­in­force a world or­der where un­der­de­vel­op­ment was the con­se­quence of cap­i­tal­ist power and con­trol in some parts of the world? Maybe. So what hap­pened since 2000? There have been ma­jor changes in the world econ­omy, and with this, geopol­i­tics. The old aid frame with western na­tions and rich phi­lan­thropists from the US set­ting the agenda has gone (or at least par­tially). The declines in ag­gre­gate poverty achieved since then were not largely the re­sult of MDG in­ter­ven­tions at all, but the growth of China (and also In­dia, parts of Latin Amer­ica and more re­cently some coun­tries in Africa). These changes were not driven by goals and tar­gets, or vil­lage pi­lot projects such as Sachs’ much crit­i­cised Mil­len­nium Vil­lages, but by eco­nomic as­pi­ra­tion, cap­i­tal­ist ex­pan­sion and growth. But I must ad­mit that my cyn­i­cism for the MDGs has waned over 15 years, and this gives me hope for the SDGs. There are a num­ber of rea­sons. In­vest­ment linked to MDG tar­gets has in some places re­sulted in sig­nif­i­cant gains. Ethiopia was one coun­try for ex­am­ple that took the MDGs se­ri­ously. The sta­tis­tics are im­pres­sive. Child mor­tal­ity is down by twothirds from 1990, and var­i­ous other tar­gets — on women’s em­pow­er­ment, nutri­tion and food in­se­cu­rity — have been met. Yes, there have been dis­tor­tions — some­times a blind fo­cus on a tar­get, for­get­ting the wider pic­ture — but the ef­fect has been gal­vanis­ing. A com­mit­ment to a new state-led devel­op­men­tal­ism is es­pe­cially ap­par­ent in Ethiopia, the in­her­i­tance of the late Prime Min­is­ter, Me­les Ze­nawi, but it’s ev­i­dent else­where too. In a pe­riod when the ne­olib­eral mantra has been the eco­nomic dis­ci­pline, the re­treat of the state and re­liance on the pri­vate sec­tor and vol­un­tarism, the ef­forts of states like Ethiopia, com­mit­ted in part­ner­ship with in­ter­na­tional donors to United Na­tions am­bi­tions, is im­pres­sive. Per­haps most im­por­tantly, the MDGs opened up a po­lit­i­cal space for a de­bate about de­vel­op­ment. The UNDP’s MDG “cam­paign” was im­por­tant in keep­ing a de­vel­op­ment agenda on the radar of gov­ern­ments around the world, and for­mer di­rec­tor of the United Na­tions Mil­len­nium Cam­paign, Salil Shetty, now sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the hu­man rights or­gan­i­sa­tion, Amnesty In­ter­na­tional, was a great ini­tial cham­pion. These com­mit­ments were am­pli­fied, ex­tended and sup­ported of course by the ma­jor ef­forts of NGOs and civil so­ci­ety groups, around “Make Poverty History”, and other cam­paigns. With­out such col­lec­tive ac­tion and po­lit­i­cal pres­sure, the temp­ta­tion to cut aid bud­gets in the face of the late 2000s fi­nan­cial cri­sis would have been even greater. The sum­mits and grand UN meet­ings may have been per­for­ma­tive cir­cuses, but they have also pro­vided a fo­cus for ad­vo­cacy and chal­lenge. The pol­i­tics of global sum­mitry can be one where new ideas emerge, cre­at­ing space for more rad­i­cal al­ter­na­tives. Mov­ing be­yond the tar­get cul­ture and shift­ing to­wards gen­er­at­ing glob­ally-agreed norms for pol­icy and ac­tion — as has hap­pened around hu­man rights, women’s rights and the en­vi­ron­ment — is per­haps a more ap­pro­pri­ate fo­cus for ad­vo­cacy, rather than get­ting hung up on all the goals and tar­gets, while still keep­ing gov­ern­ments to ac­count around key themes. In a pe­riod of fi­nan­cial cri­sis, aus­ter­ity, in­ward-fac­ing na­tion­al­ist pol­i­tics and a geopol­i­tics over­taken by the “war on terror” post 9/11, the MDGs were in some way an im­por­tant counter, of­fer­ing a more in­ter­na­tion­al­ist vi­sion of de­vel­op­ment, and a con­fir­ma­tion of the UN ideals. Fif­teen years on, I have emerged with a some­what less cyn­i­cal view. But what of the SDGs? Might these of­fer the same? Just maybe. If you read the doc­u­ment you will prob­a­bly de­spair. It’s full of high-flown rhetoric and grandiose state­ments — most of which are rather mean­ing­less hot air and grand ges­tures. Great fod­der for the cynic. But I think if we (largely) for­get the goals and tar­gets (ex­cept as po­lit­i­cally use­ful tools), and fo­cus on the wider pol­i­tics of the SDGs, we can see (per­haps) some rad­i­cal po­ten­tial. There are five things that might help as­suage the cynic in me. First, again, the launch this week, and the con­tin­ued pres­ence of the goals, agreed by all na­tions, opens up a po­lit­i­cal space, as the MDGs did in 2000. Like then, it will have to be fol­lowed up by an en­er­getic cam­paign, and rad­i­cal voices will need to en­ter the de­bates to keep gov­ern­ments on their toes. To­day, the broader con­di­tions for a new ar­gu­ment for de­vel­op­ment are even less promis­ing than in 2000, so we need to catch the mo­ment, and state our case. Sec­ond, and this is em­pha­sised re­peat­edly in the agree­ment doc­u­ment, the SDGs are uni­ver­sal — for all na­tions. This is not a “de­vel­op­ment” doc­u­ment, with the un­equal re­la­tions be­tween “donor” and “re­cip­i­ent” in­scribed. In­stead, this is as rel­e­vant to the UK as it is to Zim­babwe, and ac­count­abil­i­ties and com­mit­ments must work in all di­rec­tions. This is an im­por­tant de­par­ture from the MDGs that had the old (post-colo­nial) aid frame­work at the core. Re­cently the SDGs were dis­cussed in the UK Par­lia­ment, but in the wrong com­mit­tee. The SDGs are not just the con­cern of the In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Com­mit­tee but of all gov­ern­ment. SDGs should be dis­cussed un­der Home Af­fairs, as well as de­vel­op­ment. Third, the ex­plicit link­ing of sus­tain­abil­ity and so en­vi­ron­men­tal con­cerns, es­pe­cially cli­mate change, is vi­tal. Long-term, sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment can­not for­get this. The MDGs pi­geon-holed en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues, and did not see them in­te­gral to all de­vel­op­ment. Bring­ing sus­tain­abil­ity cen­tre stage is cru­cial, as the world ne­go­ti­ates a fu­ture in the con­text of cli­mate change. In terms of UN ef­forts, it also brings de­vel­op­ment (UNDP) closer to en­vi­ron­ment (UNEP), and so makes the con­nec­tions that have been at­tempted re­peat­edly in Stock­holm, Rio, Johannesburg and Rio again. Fourth, what is needed here, along with the wider “cam­paign” for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, is what emerged from the 1992 Rio Sum­mit on En­vi­ron­ment and De­vel­op­ment — a lo­cal level move­ment for sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, based on prac­ti­cal change on the ground. Back then it was called Agenda 21. Re­mem­ber that? Agenda 21 pe­tered out and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment be­came in­creas­ingly the do­main of global sum­mitry and COP events as­so­ci­ated with cli­mate change. But with­out prac­ti­cal en­act­ments of sus­tain­abil­ity, and a rad­i­cal re­al­i­sa­tion of what it means in dif­fer­ent places, the big am­bi­tions will fall flat. Fifth, a new devel­op­men­tal­ism, linked to a uni­ver­sal com­mit­ment to an in­ter­na­tion­alised so­lu­tion among the com­mu­nity of na­tions, gives the UN a piv­otal role. As a new sec­re­tarygen­eral is sought, I hope that who­ever is ap­pointed will keep these vi­sions cen­tral and push mem­ber states to match their sign­ing up to the SDGs with con­sis­tent fi­nanc­ing and con­certed ac­tion in line with the goals. This will not just mean carp­ing at the fail­ures of so-called de­vel­op­ing na­tions, but will mean keep­ing de­vel­oped na­tions to their word. As the UK im­poses yet more aus­ter­ity mea­sures that af­fect poor peo­ple and eth­nic mi­nori­ties most harshly, at the same time as cut­ting sup­port for tran­si­tions to green energy, will David Cameron, a great sup­porter of the SDGs, take note? Green trans­for­ma­tions in­volve pol­i­tics, and re­quire both high level goals, but most cru­cially or­gan­ised col­lec­tive ac­tion. As we dis­cussed in the book The Pol­i­tics of Green Trans­for­ma­tions these may oc­cur through a va­ri­ety of pro­cesses, be­ing led by tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion, State in­ter­ven­tion, mar­ket re­forms or citizen ac­tions. Lessons show that sus­tained trans­for­ma­tions to sus­tain­abil­ity re­quire po­lit­i­cal coali­tions be­tween groups through mo­bil­i­sa­tion across sites and scales. If the SDGs are to have mean­ing it is this new pol­i­tics that will make the dif­fer­ence, and not get­ting hung up on the many goals or tar­gets.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161227,Link for­eign pol­icy to our Di­as­pora,"De­fence and in­tel­li­gence links are not the only re­la­tion­ships we need to cul­ti­vate. Trade in­ter­ests would be more im­por­tant than some of th­ese. An ex­am­ple is Brexit! To Zim­babwe, Brexit should be an op­por­tu­nity. AT THE re­cent Zanu-PF peo­ple’s con­fer­ence, some min­is­ters made pre­sen­ta­tions. Most if not all of them sounded very pos­i­tive. The in­ter­est­ing thing was the del­e­gates ap­peared quite dis­in­ter­ested or sim­ply in­dif­fer­ent. Read­ing the pa­pers, the fol­low­ing day it gave the im­pres­sion that the press was also not pay­ing at­ten­tion. There are var­ied ex­pla­na­tions to this. One of th­ese could be that we were be­ing fed un­truths and every­one knew it and were just too po­lite to say it. One per­son who did not make a pre­sen­ta­tion and did not lead or par­tic­i­pate in any the­matic com­mit­tee was the party Sec­re­tary for Ex­ter­nal Re­la­tions who also dou­bles as the Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs. It’s either the party be­lieves that its mem­ber­ship should have no say in the for­eign pol­icy of the coun­try or the sub­ject is con­sid­ered too tech­ni­cal for the com­pre­hen­sion by Cde Johnny Mem­ber or not im­por­tant enough. But with such a large Di­as­pora body, Zim­babwe’s for­eign pol­icy has a mas­sive bear­ing on the state of both the coun­try and the econ­omy. There is a case of this is­sue be­ing one of the is­sues the party should give to the Ex­ec­u­tive. At the present mo­ment the av­er­age party mem­ber has no clue what the main thrust of our for­eign pol­icy is. All they know is that our rhetoric (should) at­tack the West and eu­lo­gise the East. They know there are cer­tain coun­tries you can’t praise no mat­ter what else is hap­pen­ing in re­al­ity. But what re­ally should be en­tailed in our for­eign pol­icy? We have to cre­atively align our­selves to coun­tries in a way that max­imises our own lever­age. The pol­i­tics of hate or tak­ing ad­van­tage of a po­larised world worked well dur­ing the Cold War era where we stood to ben­e­fit from sur­ro­gacy. Th­ese days, coun­tries can be friends with two coun­tries who are at war. Each re­la­tion­ship is eas­ily com­part­men­talised. Na­tions get that. This is be­cause for a coun­try like Zim­babwe, it has no known de­fence al­liance with any­one. This would be where one would say an en­emy of a friend is my en­emy. But re­la­tion­ships now have a lot more to do with par­tic­u­lar na­tional and strate­gic in­ter­ests. De­fence and in­tel­li­gence links are not the only re­la­tion­ships we need to cul­ti­vate. Trade in­ter­ests would be more im­por­tant than some of th­ese. An ex­am­ple is Brexit! To Zim­babwe, Brexit should be an op­por­tu­nity. Bri­tain needs to open new chan­nels of trade in­clud­ing sources for raw ma­te­ri­als and mar­kets for its prod­ucts. We should not adopt the at­ti­tude that with des­per­a­tion, Bri­tain will come to us cap in hand. That is a con­ve­nient lie. We are not the only coun­try with th­ese raw ma­te­ri­als. We should be able to snatch this op­por­tu­nity and for­get about our petty ide­o­log­i­cal dif­fer­ences and look at the big­ger pic­ture - in the na­tional in­ter­est. Our for­eign pol­icy should not be based on ar­chaic “mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive re­la­tion­ships”. This is to say, a close re­la­tion­ship with China is great, but that re­la­tion­ship is not pred­i­cated upon a premise where Zim­babwe should have a bro­ken re­la­tion­ship with, say, Great Bri­tain and all the other West­ern coun­tries to which Bri­tain fran­chised its di­plo­matic tiff with Zim­babwe. Af­ter all, just in 2014 the UK ex­ported goods worth £18,7 bil­lion to China and im­ported goods worth £38,3 bil­lion from China. China is the UK’s sixth big­gest ex­port mar­ket. When it comes to tourism, Chi­nese vis­i­tors con­trib­ute half a bil­lion pounds to the UK econ­omy. What do th­ese fig­ures tell us? They clearly tell us that China has a se­ri­ous eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship with the United King­dom and the now thaw­ing bi­lat­eral tiff be­tween Zim­babwe and the UK is not and has never been a fac­tor. It shows that China al­ways com­part­men­talised its bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship with Zim­babwe as well as its bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship with the United King­dom. What seems to be the prob­lem is that we ap­pear to have still held to the dis­cred­ited no­tion that an ad­vance in one re­la­tion­ship is at the ex­pense of an­other. No, this is not polygamy. Geopol­i­tics and diplo­macy moved from that po­si­tion a while back. It is time to ex­pand the scope and the depth of our re­la­tion­ship with the United King­dom to take ad­van­tage of Brexit. We can­not as a na­tion base our for­eign pol­icy on sen­ti­men­tal­ity and ar­ti­fi­cial emo­tional ten­sions, no mat­ter how ad­van­ta­geous it is to our lo­cal pol­i­tics. Rhetor­i­cally it might have a lot of res­o­nance in our lo­cal con­stituen­cies, but sub­stan­tially there is a price to pay How good a lead­er­ship is, should be judged not on its ca­pac­ity to en­thuse a crowd. It is about its abil­ity to max­imise the ad­van­tages avail­able to it for the ben­e­fit of its peo­ple. At the heart of all this is a friend­ship with all coun­tries based on mu­tual re­spect and, of course, re­spect of each other’s sovereignty. Rap­proche­ment with the UK is not a con­tra­dic­tion to this prin­ci­ple. And, one thing we need now is a way of grow­ing our mid­dle class. The world is fast chang­ing and be­com­ing com­plex. There is a new for­eign pol­icy par­a­digm, one which does not in­clude play­ing the East against the West. It is only an­chored on do­ing that which makes your coun­try se­cure as well as up­lift the qual­ity of life of the peo­ple at home. Yes, there are moral po­si­tions such as al­ways align­ing with fel­low African states and cul­ti­vat­ing such pan-African­ist link­ages. But, serv­ing na­tional in­ter­ests is best done by keep­ing the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion happy. This is what makes the peo­ple and the other non-state stake­hold­ers play their part and work with the State for the com­mon good. We can­not talk of sovereignty and na­tional se­cu­rity whilst ig­nor­ing the se­cu­rity of the in­di­vid­ual. Now the se­cu­rity of the in­di­vid­ual is not just about free from phys­i­cal harm or threats. It is about fi­nan­cial se­cu­rity and an as­sur­ance that the next gen­er­a­tion has a hope and fu­ture. So, when we build our in­ter­con­nect­ed­ness and link­ages with other na­tions, it should not be based on some high sound­ing moral grand­stand­ing, but on how the com­mon per­son stands to gain from such re­la­tion­ships. Right now, some of the most im­por­tant na­tions to Zim­babwe are the ones where most of its cit­i­zens are based. Whilst con­flict and the fortress men­tal­ity ral­lies peo­ple to­gether and is an ad­van­tage to short-term po­lit­i­cal goals, we can­not put the na­tion in a state of per­pet­ual emo­tional con­flict with na­tions that are im­por­tant to us. That does not ap­pear to be serv­ing our na­tional in­ter­ests. Zim­babwe has played a key role on global is­sues. It has per­formed ex­cep­tion­ally well at that level. But when its pop­u­la­tion is af­flicted by hunger and poverty, it does not seem to be do­ing a lot of good. When ev­ery year thou­sands of our young peo­ple en­ter an ever dis­ap­pear­ing job mar­ket and our young women ap­pear to be choos­ing a meal over love in their op­tions for a spouse, we should stop and re­visit our poli­cies. But only this time let us fo­cus on that for­eign pol­icy. To­day is not 15 years ago. As much as 1980 was not 1965, so 2016 is not 2001. For­eign poli­cies of then are no longer fit for pur­pose now. The pace at which the world is chang­ing is breath­tak­ing. Our view of the world and plan to make our­selves rel­e­vant in it should also be equally dy­namic. One of the most dy­namic and prag­matic ways of for­mu­lat­ing a for­eign pol­icy is to link it to our Di­as­pora. Re­la­tion­ships with those coun­tries which play a host to large num­bers of our na­tion­al­i­ties should be em­pha­sised. Fail­ure to that is not only miss­ing a se­ri­ous op­por­tu­nity but hav­ing a for­eign pol­icy out of a gen­er­a­tional con­text. And that does not serve the na­tion’ Serv­ing the na­tion is not try­ing to force the peo­ple to be­lieve that they are do­ing well when, in ac­tual fact, they don’t feel it, see it and are cer­tainly not ex­pe­ri­enc­ing it. Serv­ing the na­tion well is to have tan­gi­ble re­sults ev­i­dent in the day-to-day lives of the peo­ple. So, Zim­bab­weans must feel, wit­ness and ex­pe­ri­ence all those pos­i­tives the Pres­i­dent was told of at the con­fer­ence. Of course, there are a lot of pos­i­tives that are hap­pen­ing in the econ­omy. The de­cent sup­ply of elec­tric­ity is a start­ing point. But th­ese pos­i­tives are over­whelmed by the scan­dals that also hap­pen at the same time. In­stead of the Zim­babwe Elec­tric­ity Trans­mis­sion and Dis­tri­bu­tion Com­pany (ZETDC) be­ing eu­lo­gised for the good it has done, there are way too many scan­dals in­clud­ing ten­der rig­ging, which of course is more head­line grab­bing news.

It is th­ese scan­dals that in­vestors and me­dia watch­ers, as well as for­eign pol­icy mak­ers, feed on and shape their at­ti­tudes on. The only for­eign pol­icy Zim­bab­weans care about is the one that pos­i­tively trans­forms lo­cal lives.",津巴布韦
zw,NewsDay (Zimbabwe),20201215,Oil deal: Is the govt safe­guard­ing Zim­babwe’s in­ter­ests?,"IN 2014, The Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) ex­posed how Chi­nese mid­dle­men had joined the ranks of African re­source plun­der­ers. A Chi­nese multi­na­tional, with the help of a net­worked for­mer in­tel­li­gence chief, were cream­ing off the re­gion’s vast oil re­source and min­er­als be­fore clean­ing dirty money on sprawl­ing waterfront sky­scrapers. In the ju­ris­dic­tions that the top-end real es­tate gems were pur­chased, of­fice and in­dus­trial space is gold. They are not just mon­u­men­tal icons that com­pete to touch the skies. They gen­er­ate real wealth for the crooks that ma­nip­u­late Africa, while for hun­dreds of mil­lions of her peo­ple, it is a real vic­tory to af­ford a sin­gle meal. Ze­ro­ing in on the African in­ter­ests of Sam Pa, the man it de­scribed as “China’s Mid­dle­man in Africa”, The FT ex­posed an elab­o­rate plun­der scourge link­ing not only Chi­nese firms but the world’s big­gest multi­na­tion­als to se­ri­ous crimes in Africa. Th­ese had hooked up with se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in coun­tries like oil-rich An­gola and Nigeria, to­gether with Zim­babwe and Guinea, which have huge en­dow­ments of the most sought-af­ter min­er­als. It is a fright­en­ing web of un­der­ground firms and crafty per­son­al­i­ties with the power to sweet talk au­thor­i­ties into ap­pend­ing their sig­na­tures on murky deals. “The Queensway group of com­pa­nies have made them­selves a part­ner of choice for the re­pres­sive regimes that con­trol some of Africa’s most re­source-rich States, where cor­rup­tion traps mil­lions in poverty while their rulers amass ex­tra­or­di­nary wealth — from Robert Mu­gabe’s Zim­babwe and a mur­der­ous junta in Guinea to the cor­rupt petro-States of An­gola and Nigeria,” said the FT. The fact that Zim­babwe was on this list was not mere co­in­ci­dence. The loot­ing spree, which has con­tin­ued till to­day, had at­tained cat­a­strophic lev­els, with traces of Harare’s di­a­monds be­ing found across the world’s fastest grow­ing and spend­ing re­gions, to­gether with the tra­di­tional ad­vanced economies. This is how more wealth has been leav­ing Africa ev­ery year than what comes through. In 2018, cam­paign­ers at the Global Jus­tice Now placed the dif­fer­ence be­tween the wealth that was leav­ing Africa, and that which was en­ter­ing the con­ti­nent at over US$40 bil­lion. For Zim­babwe, this loot­ing at global scale was con­firmed by an In­ter­na­tional Cri­sis Group (ICG) pa­per three weeks ago, which placed the value of di­a­monds smug­gled an­nu­ally at US$1,5 bil­lion. This is a huge amount by any mea­sure. But for a frag­ile African coun­try that has bat­tled to feed mil­lions of its peo­ple for decades, this may be a catas­tro­phe. The gen­e­sis of the loot­ing can squarely be linked to gov­ern­ment poli­cies that force small-scale min­ers to sell their pre­cious metal to a unit of the cen­tral bank, which pays for gold 70% in US dol­lars. Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s gov­ern­ment went quiet when the ICG re­port came out, prob­a­bly con­firm­ing that it had run out of ideas to end the loot­ing. “Es­ti­mates sug­gest that more than US$1,5 bil­lion worth of gold leaves Zim­babwe il­le­gally each year, of­ten end­ing up in Dubai,” said the re­port ICG. How­ever, gov­ern­ment is un­der pres­sure to act. Be­fore the gold catas­tro­phe, US$15 bil­lion had van­ished in Zim­babwe’s di­a­mond fields, with rights cam­paign­ers de­mand­ing ex­pla­na­tion on be­half of a pop­u­la­tion that has been haunted into si­lence even at time State trans­gres­sions are very vis­i­ble. But in the past few months, Harare has demon­strated that it will not keep quiet when its gas fields, where Aus­tralia’s In­vic­tus En­ergy is con­vinced it may strike the riches soon, be­gin eject­ing the black gold out of the earth’s crust. On this one, there is no room for er­ror or mis­judge­ments. Harare wants its pound of the flesh. In­vic­tus is scour­ing Zim­babwe’s north eastern front for po­ten­tially lu­cra­tive oil or gas en­dow­ments. But even be­fore the oil or gas is pumped out, Mnan­gagwa’s ad­min­is­tra­tion wants a con­crete agree­ment that ties the par­ties to trans­parency and fair­ness from the day the first drop shoots to the sur­face. This will be achieved through sign­ing a pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ment (PSA). It is an at­tempt to make sure that oil, or gas, if found, will not turn into an­other re­source curse. Pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ments, like con­ces­sion agree­ments have been around for as long as there has been oil pro­duc­tion. The agree­ment pro­vides a con­ces­sion of ex­plo­ration, devel­op­ment, and pro­duc­tion rights to an in­vestor who in turn would re­im­burse the re­source owner with a stated per­cent­age of the pro­duced re­sources. One of the defin­ing char­ac­ter­is­tics of con­ces­sion agree­ments used to be that con­ces­sions were thought to con­fer ti­tle of the oil in the ground to the oil com­pany, thus caus­ing de­bates re­gard­ing own­er­ship of the oil. At the present mo­ment, mod­ern leg­is­la­tion in many coun­tries in­clude pro­vi­sions that clearly state that the gov­ern­ment is the re­source owner. Pri­vate sub­soil prop­erty rights are recog­nised only in the US and South Africa. “The es­sen­tial dif­fer­ence be­tween con­ces­sion agree­ments and pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ments is that the lat­ter pro­vides for pay­ment to the re­source owner af­ter the re­cov­ery of pro­duc­tion costs. The pay­ment mech­a­nisms to the re­source owner are the sole dif­fer­ences be­tween the three types of agree­ments,” says the Kaza­khstan Busi­ness Mag­a­zine. “By per­mit­ting the in­vestor to re­cover his ex­penses first, pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ments have be­come pop­u­lar with the high-risk oil in­dus­try, since they carry low­est risks for the in­vestor. As a gen­eral rule, pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ments are on the pro­gres­sive side of the risk con­tin­uum, as op­posed to the gen­er­ally re­gres­sive con­ces­sion agree­ments,” the mag­a­zine note. Around 2008, the late Mu­gabe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion de­ployed scores of spe­cial of­fi­cers from the Min­er­als Mar­ket­ing Cor­po­ra­tion of Zim­babwe to guard the places where platinum was pre­pared for ex­por­ta­tion to pre­vent loot­ing. But the ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tin­ued to cry foul. So, in the oil­fields, his suc­ces­sor, Mnan­gagwa wants a deal, soon. “We have had key milestones,” Chi­tando told re­porters in Au­gust. The Zim­babwe In­vest­ment Devel­op­ment Agency li­cence has been given and the area’s spe­cial grant has been ex­tended by three years. A pro­duc­tion agree­ment is be­ing ne­go­ti­ated with gov­ern­ment. Gov­ern­ment will get a cer­tain per­cent­age of the pro­duc­tion. The draft agree­ment is in place and the fi­nal agree­ment is ex­pected in the next few weeks and drilling of the well will be in the third quar­ter of 2021,” he said. In­vic­tus says it is ready to play a fair game. Last week, it said the deal was close. “The pro­duc­tion shar­ing agree­ments (PSA) with the Re­pub­lic of Zim­babwe con­tinue to progress and are now in the ap­proval process. The com­pany will pro­vide up­dates to the mar­ket re­gard­ing progress in the fi­nal­i­sa­tion of the PSA and any as­so­ci­ated gov­ern­ment ap­provals,” said In­vic­tus. An up­date on the PSA was part of a broad range of is­sues dis­patched to the mar­ket, in­clud­ing new dis­cov­er­ies of im­por­tant sig­nals that may point to where ex­actly the for­tune lies. “The com­pany suc­cess­fully con­cluded its re­cent field op­er­a­tions and re­con­nais­sance pro­gramme in the Cab­ora Basa Basin,” said In­vic­tus. “De­tailed travers­ing and map­ping across the area has been com­pleted and iden­ti­fied the op­ti­mal ac­qui­si­tion routes. The com­pany is mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant progress on ex­e­cut­ing the first seis­mic ac­qui­si­tion pro­gramme in the coun­try for 30 years and is work­ing closely with the seis­mic con­trac­tors on a planned ac­qui­si­tion cam­paign in 2021 to com­mence once the rainy sea­son has con­cluded. This will be fol­lowed by a high im­pact basin open­ing drilling cam­paign to test the petroleum po­ten­tial of the Cab­ora Bassa Basin,” the state­ment added. In Harare Tapiwa Sibanda, an eco­nomic an­a­lyst and head of re­search at Trade Wind, said a pa­per agree­ment may not do the trick. “We need spe­cialised peo­ple with skills to work in th­ese spe­cialised ar­eas to pre­vent loot­ing,” he said. “By writing of­fi­cial agree­ments on pa­per, the par­ties are only agree­ing that they want to work to­gether. But, as we have seen on gold and di­a­monds, the multi­na­tion­als that mine the re­sources are spe­cialised. If they choose to loot they can eas­ily do that. We are hop­ing that with the gas in Zim­babwe, gov­ern­ment will make spe­cialised fol­low ups to make sure the deal is not only fair, but it ben­e­fits ev­ery­one. We are not in any way sug­gest­ing that In­vic­tus will loot gas, but the re­la­tions be­tween big busi­ness and poor African economies are known. It is not an ex­ag­ger­a­tion to say when deal­ing in th­ese spe­cialised ar­eas, gov­ern­ment must be care­ful. This is in­formed by his­tory. There were reports that an­other big di­a­monds firm looted many tonnes while still ex­plor­ing,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150529,Chi­nese also have sim­i­lar con­cerns,"LAST week Chi­nese chair­man of the Coun­cil for Pro­mot­ing South-South Co­op­er­a­tion, LV Xin­hua and his del­e­ga­tion vis­ited Zim­babwe to as­sess the coun­try’s busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. The Chi­nese met Vice-Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa, who was act­ing pres­i­dent, to dis­cuss in­vest­ment is­sues. Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to Harare Lin Lin, Chi­nese em­bassy eco­nomic and com­mer­cial ad­viser Li Yao­hui, Fi­nance min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa, Sa­muel Un­denge (En­ergy), Mike Bimha (In­dus­try and Com­merce), Obert Mpofu (Trans­port), Wal­ter Chid­hakwa (Mines), Joseph Made (Agriculture), Christo­pher Mutsvangwa (War Vet­er­ans) and the 18-mem­ber del­e­ga­tion ex­changed notes frankly on in­vest­ment mat­ters. Mnan­gagwa briefed the Chi­nese on Zim­babwe’s so­cial and eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion to give them in­sight from a govern­ment per­spec­tive. He said Zim­babwe was keen on For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment (FDI), es­pe­cially from China. Af­ter Mnan­gagwa’s re­marks, the Chi­nese with LV in charge thanked govern­ment for wel­com­ing them and in­di­cated they were look­ing for in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties across a wide range of eco­nomic sec­tors, in­clud­ing but not lim­ited to min­ing, con­struc­tion, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and man­u­fac­tur­ing. Sub­se­quently, LV tack­led the ele­phant in the room: Zim­babwe’s hos­tile busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment and ease of do­ing busi­ness. He made it clear even if the Chi­nese want to in­vest in the coun­try govern­ment must first im­prove the busi­ness cli­mate and en­sure bar­ri­ers to com­merce are re­moved to re­tain their vast in­vest­ments lo­cally and to at­tract new cap­i­tal. The Chi­nese also said Zim­babwe must re­mem­ber it is com­pet­ing with its neigh­bours and other coun­tries for in­vest­ment. This was in­ter­est­ing, com­ing as it did from the Chi­nese — Zim­babwe’s “all-weather” friends as of­fi­cials say — be­cause all busi­ness del­e­ga­tions and in­vestors have been giv­ing govern­ment the same mes­sage. Whether it’s the Amer­i­cans, the Bri­tish and other Euro­peans, Rus­sians, South Africans or Chi­nese, the mantra is the same: Cre­ate an en­abling busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment if you want se­ri­ous in­vest­ment. In fact, re­cently Zim­babwe’s own state in­vest­ment agency de­manded ur­gent pol­icy and leg­isla­tive re­forms to at­tract FDI, which has re­mained stag­nant at USS$400 mil­lion an­nu­ally com­pared to bil­lions for neigh­bour­ing coun­tries in the past two years. The World Bank has ranked Zim­babwe 171 out of 189 coun­tries on its 2014 ease of do­ing busi­ness in­dex, some­thing at­trib­uted to neg­a­tive per­cep­tions about the coun­try’s dis­as­trous poli­cies, es­pe­cially the land re­form and in­di­geni­sa­tion pro­grammes. Bad poli­cies and in­con­sis­ten­cies have widely been blamed for keep­ing in­vestors at bay. Ret­ro­gres­sive pol­i­tics and lead­er­ship fail­ures have also been cited as re­spon­si­ble for eco­nomic re­gres­sion, poverty and suf­fer­ing. Zim­babwe In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity CEO Richard Mbaiwa re­cently told a par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee that the coun­try con­tin­ues to lag be­hind its re­gional peers such as Mozam­bique and Zam­bia whose FDI in­flows have risen to US$5 bil­lion and US$2 bil­lion re­spec­tively be­cause of poor poli­cies and lack of re­forms. Po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity, pol­icy con­sis­tency and in­vestor-friendly re­forms are crit­i­cal to en­sure in­vest­ment, re­cov­ery and growth. That’s what the Chi­nese also said. Au­thor­i­ties must now lis­ten, at least for once for a change.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161121,De­vel­op­men­tal fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions and Africa’s growth,"With re­gard to en­ergy, it is es­ti­mated that the lack of en­ergy com­bined with lack of in­fra­struc­ture holds back Africa’s growth by 2 per­cent each year and con­sti­tute a ma­jor con­straint to do­ing busi­ness. THIS is an ex­cit­ing time for Africa. Since the be­gin­ning of the 2000s, Africa’s growth rate has more than dou­bled from just above 2 per­cent in 1980s and 1990s to above 5 per­cent be­tween 2001 and 2014. This eco­nomic performance was favoured by an in­creased do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional de­mand; high com­mod­ity prices, pub­lic in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture; tighter trade and in­vest­ment link­ages with emerg­ing economies such as China and im­prov­ing global eco­nomic and con­ti­nen­tal busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment. But to­day, the sit­u­a­tion has dra­mat­i­cally changed. Most of African coun­tries are con­fronted by dif­fi­cul­ties re­lated to the sharp de­cline of com­mod­ity prices, par­tic­u­larly oil and met­als with an im­pact on rev­enues. In ad­di­tion, China’s growth slow­down to be­low 7 per­cent and its tran­si­tion from in­vest­ment and ex­port of in­dus­trial goods to­wards con­sump­tion and ser­vice has also heav­ily im­pacted Africa’s eco­nomic performance. Fur­ther, cli­mate change in the form of se­vere drought and floods have af­fected elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion and food se­cu­rity. De­spite th­ese eco­nomic head­winds, Africa is still the sec­ond fastest grow­ing eco­nomic zone, with an eco­nomic growth rate es­ti­mated above 5 per­cent in 2016. This es­ti­ma­tion by the African De­vel­op­ment Bank places the con­ti­nent above the global av­er­age of 3,2 per­cent and the es­ti­mated 1,7 per­cent and 2 per­cent for the Eu­ro­zone and the US re­spec­tively. The con­ti­nent is also still post­ing good performance in terms of at­trac­tive­ness for for­eign di­rect in­vest­ments in­flows es­ti­mated to reach US$ 55-60 bil­lion in 2016. On a re­gional note, although in­tra-African cross-bor­der in­vest­ments have risen, they only ac­count for 19 per­cent of to­tal in­vest­ment to Africa and 12 per­cent of Africa to­tal for­eign in­vest­ment com- pared to 33 per­cent in Asia. On the so­cial front, Africa has made steady progress in ad­dress­ing key so­cio-eco­nomic chal­lenges. In many coun­tries, the in­ci­dence of ex­treme poverty has de­clined. At­tend­ing pri­mary school has be­come the norm, with most coun­tries hav­ing achieved univer­sal pri­mary en­rol­ment (above 90 per­cent). Nearly one half of African coun­tries have achieved gen­der par­ity in pri­mary school. Health has also seen ma­jor gains: un­der-five mor­tal­ity de­clined from 146 deaths per 1 000 live births in 1990 to 90 deaths in 2011, a 38 per­cent de­crease. Sim­i­larly, the ma­ter­nal mor­tal­ity ra­tio fell from 745 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1990 to 429 in 2010, a 42 per­cent de­crease. But Africa’s growth episode has not been suf­fi­ciently in­clu­sive and di­verse be­cause it is still mainly based on nat­u­ral re­sources ex­ploita­tion and ex­port with­out added value, and there­fore no op­por­tu­nity to max­imise the share of wealth drawn from its vast raw ma­te­ri­als for Africans. It is in this con­text of seek­ing in­clu­sive and sus­tain­able growth that the African Union has re­sponded by de­vel­op­ing Agenda 2063 for the “Africa We Want”. Agenda 2063, which em­beds the global Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals ( SDGs), is a for­ward-look­ing vi­sion that projects Africa over the next five decades con­sid­er­ing it as “an in­te­grated and pros­per­ous con­ti­nent, where growth is in­clu­sive; a con­ti­nent at peace with him­self, play­ing an ac­tive role on the global scene.” Agenda 2063 re­flects the as­pi­ra­tions of the en­tire African con­ti­nent; a pros­per­ous con­ti­nent with high-qual­ity growth that cre­ates more em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for all, es­pe­cially women and youth. In this vi­sion, sound poli­cies, bet­ter in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy will drive Africa’s trans­for­ma­tion by im­prov­ing the con­di­tions for pri­vate sec­tor de­vel­op­ment and by boost­ing in­vest­ment, en­trepreneur­ship and mi­cro, small and medium en­ter­prises. In the con­text of Agenda 2063, trans­for­ma­tion means diver­si­fy­ing the sources of eco­nomic growth and op­por­tu­nity in a way that pro­motes higher pro­duc­tiv­ity, re­sult­ing in sus­tained and in­clu­sive eco­nomic growth. It also means sup­port­ing the de­vel­op­ment of in­dus­tries that in­crease the im­pact of the ex­ist­ing sources of com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage and en­hance Africa’s global com­pet­i­tive po­si­tion. Achiev­ing Agenda 2063 and its flag­ship pro­grammes will re­quire a col­lec­tive ef­fort by all African stake­hold­ers and to that end, the role of African de­vel­op­ment fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions can­not be overem­pha­sised. Un­der Agenda 2063, we see de­vel­op­ment fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions ( DFIs) as pow­er­ful in­sti­tu­tions that can in­vest in sus­tain­able pri­vate sec­tor projects with the twofold ob­jec­tive of spurring so­cio-eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and de­vel­op­ment in African coun­tries while them­selves re­main­ing fi­nan­cially vi­able.

zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20201009,"Re­forms, in­te­gra­tion: Africa’s only chance for re­cov­ery post-Covid-19","As the coro­n­avirus pan­demic reaches the prob­a­ble end of its life cy­cle, the world econ­omy has been dev­as­tated and may pos­si­bly crash with it. It is more con­cern­ing to note that there are still pos­si­bil­i­ties of a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic ac­cord­ing to some health ex­perts. In Europe and the United States, the statis­tics have al­ready pointed out to the emer­gence of a sec­ond wave with the United King­dom in­tro­duc­ing new re­stric­tions and con­tem­plat­ing en­act­ing fur­ther mea­sures if the need arises. On the other hand, de­vel­op­ing economies have had much less fa­tal­i­ties to their ad­van­tage but they have been the most af­fected in terms of eco­nomic re­gres­sion. With a global eco­nomic con­trac­tion of 5,4%, South Africa will per­form worse and reg­is­ter a con­trac­tion of 7,2% and Zim­babwe will be closely in that re­gion with a con­trac­tion of 7,4%. Both South Africa and Zim­babwe have high­lighted the im­por­tance of in­tro­duc­ing struc­tural re­forms in or­der to make their re­spec­tive economies more ef­fi­cient and thus make the post-pan­demic re­cov­ery more cer­tain and en­dur­ing. In Zim­babwe, the pan­demic emerged in the midst of Fi­nance min­is­ter Mthuli Ncube’s two-year struc­tural pro­gramme la­belled the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TSP) which is ex­pected to run its full course by the end of 2020 and will be re­placed by the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Plan (NDP). Un­der the TSP, there was fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion, lib­er­al­i­sa­tion of the ex­change rate, rein­tro­duc­tion of the Zim­bab­wean dol­lar, achieve­ment of a bal­ance of pay­ments sur­plus and in the re­cent months, a sta­bil­i­sa­tion of out of hand in­fla­tion and ex­change rates. Sim­i­larly, in South Africa, Fi­nance min­is­ter Tito Mboweni high­lighted the ur­gency to in­tro­duce a struc­tural pro­gramme for the South African econ­omy to­wards the end of March. A spe­cial unit set up to over­see the struc­tural changes in the South African econ­omy called vulindlela, which means, “lead the way”, in isiZulu, was also re­ported to be op­er­a­tional, in the fore­see­able fu­ture. The de­ci­sion by the South African min­is­ter to con­cen­trate more on struc­tural re­forms came hard on the foot of a rat­ings down­grade of South Africa’s sov­er­eign credit rat­ing by Moody’s, which left South Africa with­out an in­vest­ment-grade credit rat­ing. Some tra­di­tional fo­cus ar­eas of struc­tural re­forms are: ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion of gov­ern­ment op­er­a­tions and ex­pen­di­ture, labour mar­ket rigidi­ties, strength­en­ing the le­gal frame­work and in­sti­tu­tions, ad­dress­ing in­equal­ity and so forth. The four afore­men­tioned struc­tural re­forms will be ex­plained later on in more de­tail and weighed for their ef­fec­tive­ness and rel­e­vance. Re­forms are im­per­a­tive as they in­crease the chances of a coun­try to get credit from in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions such as the IMF and world bank. As the struc­tural re­forms are in­tro­duced to de­vel­op­ing economies, will they be im­pact­ful? Do de­vel­op­ing economies need more than the tra­di­tional tem­plate of struc­tural re­forms for en­dur­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery? These are im­por­tant ques­tions that should be part of the pol­i­cy­mak­ers’ day to day in­qui­si­tion. De­vel­op­ing economies are usu­ally branded as in­ef­fi­cient and largely de­pend on com­modi­ties and for­eign cap­i­tal in or­der to sus­tain. This year, eco­nomic re­cov­ery has been made more un­cer­tain and com­plex due to the fact that ad­vanced economies which tra­di­tion­ally bail out the de­vel­op­ing economies have lim­ited ca­pac­ity and may not avail them­selves suf­fi­ciently, leav­ing de­vel­op­ing economies with no choice but to go along with the old adage which says, “adapt or die”. In­deed, it is a tall or­der and with­out proper pol­icy in­ter­ven­tion liveli­hoods are at risk. An ar­gu­ment may be pre­sented that eco­nomic In­te­gra­tion of the re­gion can make the process of eco­nomic re­cov­ery much swifter when cou­pled with struc­tural re­forms. Zim­babwe may start by align­ing its eco­nomic sys­tem with South Africa, for ex­am­ple, or vice-versa. There­after, the two coun­tries may take an­other step for­ward and in­te­grate more and more coun­tries within the re­gion un­til the whole con­ti­nent is in­te­grated, ide­ally. With a global record low of weak de­mand, poor ex­change rate po­si­tions and less cap­i­tal in­flows, African coun­tries now have to take the lead and work to­wards com­pre­hen­sive struc­tural re­forms plus eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion for an African in­spired so­lu­tion to at­tend to African prob­lems. In June, Mboweni con­veyed that with the cur­rent global eco­nomic con­trac­tion, the world was fac­ing the broad­est col­lapse of per capita in­comes since 1870. Africa has a chance to break away from a his­tory of re­liance for di­rec­tion and as­sis­tance with re­gards man­ag­ing its own eco­nomic af­fairs. There is prob­a­bly no bet­ter time to work to­wards this goal than now. By def­i­ni­tion, eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion can be viewed as co­op­er­a­tion amongst coun­tries to en­hance trade and co­or­di­nate their re­spec­tive mone­tary and fis­cal poli­cies. Ad­van­tages such as avail­abil­ity of a larger com­mon mar­ket, scale economies and flex­i­bil­ity of do­ing busi­ness through the scrap­ping of tar­iffs and other reg­u­la­tory pro­cesses are en­joyed. Ex­am­ples of eco­nom­i­cally in­te­grated sys­tems in­clude the South African Cus­toms Union (SACU) which in­cludes the fol­low­ing mem­ber coun­tries: Botswana, Eswa­tini, Le­sotho and South Africa. With SACU, there is a com­mon ex­ter­nal tar­iff which en­cour­ages trade amongst mem­ber states as it is favourable com­pared to non mem­ber states. There is also the shar­ing of cus­toms rev­enues and a co­or­di­na­tion of trade poli­cies. A more ad­vanced eco­nomic union is the Euro­pean Union (EU) made up of 27 Euro­pean states. With the EU, mem­ber states en­joy the free move­ment of fi­nan­cial flows, labour, cap­i­tal and a com­mon mar­ket of over 500 mil­lion con­sumers. With such a large com­mon mar­ket, Euro­pean com­pa­nies have a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage where they en­joy scale and mar­ket­ing economies. Sadc and re­gional coun­tries have an op­por­tu­nity to in­te­grate eco­nom­i­cally for a sus­tain­able post-pan­demic re­cov­ery. With­out in­te­gra­tion, re­gional coun­tries will con­tinue to be out­paced by global play­ers such as China, the US and Europe. The ad­vanced global play­ers have the nat­u­ral ad­van­tage of large do­mes­tic mar­kets there­fore com­pet­ing with them on the ba­sis of struc­tural re­forms only, will not be enough. There is need to cou­ple re­forms with eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion for cre­at­ing larger do­mes­tic mar­kets and other per­ti­nent ben­e­fits. When the re­gion doesn’t de­velop, the cy­cle of poverty and un­der­de­vel­op­ment will per­sist. There is an op­por­tu­nity to break from this cy­cle of de­pen­dence on ad­vanced economies at this point in time. Since re­gional economies have the same po­lit­i­cal, so­cial and eco­nomic chal­lenges, it may be ad­vis­able for them to co-or­di­nate and ad­dress their chal­lenges. In Zim­babwe, the TSP man­aged to reign in a civil ser­vice wage bill which com­prised 92% of all gov­ern­ment rev­enue in 2017 and cur­rently sits at be­low 50%. The gov­ern­ment was un­able to com­mit funds to­wards other im­por­tant eco­nomic as­sign­ments such as cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture, of which it is now ca­pa­ble to some ex­tent. In South Africa, Mboweni has pro­nounced his keen­ness to cur­tail a run­away civil ser­vice wage bill and over­all fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion. The coun­try now awaits the pre­sen­ta­tion of the midterm bud­get which will give the for­mal di­rec­tion of ac­tual steps that will be taken for fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion. It is also im­por­tant for gov­ern­ment to con­tain its bor­row­ings and the re­sul­tant debt bur­den. Un­der the TSP, Ncube man­aged to turn around peren­nial bud­get deficits into bud­get sur­pluses. Dif­fi­cult as it was, the peo­ple of Zim­babwe and the min­is­ter de­serve to be recog­nised for their sac­ri­fices which led to the sur­pluses. It takes cold aus­ter­ity to re­alise such a turn­around within only a two year pe­riod. Gov­ern­ment bor­row­ings must ide­ally be avoided as they crowd out lend­ing to the pri­vate sec­tor. Fail­ure to utilise debt ef­fec­tively can also re­sult in so­cial un­rest and po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity. More­over, some loans will only be pro­vided with strin­gent con­di­tions which may com­pro­mise the econ­omy’s per­for­mance. Some con­di­tions at­tached to the loans given to de­vel­op­ing economies are a po­lit­i­cal hard sell given that they lead to the shed­ding of jobs, in­fla­tion and other con­se­quences as a re­sult of the aus­tere mea­sures which are part of the con­di­tions as part of the debt. For Zim­babwe , gov­ern­ment own­er­ship of re­sources and pri­vati­sa­tion of state en­ti­ties have also been in­cor­po­rated in the TSP with POSB, Zesa, TelOne, NetOne and GMB be­ing marked for im­me­di­ate re­form. In South Africa, the pri­vati­sa­tion de­bate is still present and ques­tions on whether to pri­va­tise en­ti­ties such as South African Air­ways, Eskom and Transnet are still to be ul­ti­mately ad­dressed. These pub­lic en­ti­ties have been bleed­ing the South African “fis­cus” through peren­nial eco­nomic pack­ages known as bailouts which were be­ing dis­persed by gov­ern­ment in or­der to keep these cor­po­ra­tions afloat. It is re­gret­table that after sev­eral years with these en­ti­ties get­ting eco­nomic as­sis­tance they are still in dire debt and are fac­ing op­er­a­tional prob­lems. Since the pri­vati­sa­tion ques­tion is very po­lar­is­ing , al­ter­na­tive pro­pos­als should be wel­come. What would the out­come of one elec­tric­ity com­pany sup­ply­ing the whole of Sadc be like? Will eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and merg­ers of paras­tatals within the re­gion of­fer dif­fer­ent re­sults? Will scale economies be en­joyed? Will mar­ket size economies be en­joyed? Will these mega com­pa­nies bring about a rise in tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment through spe­cialised re­search and de­vel­op­ment de­part­ments? Will the cost of pub­lic goods be lower? An­swer­ing these ques­tions will help guide valid pro­pos­als for the fu­ture of state owned en­ter­prises in the re­gion. Labour mar­ket rigidi­ties are a present struc­tural chal­lenge that needs to be at­tended to by de­vel­op­ing economies. The lack of highly skilled work­ers or their em­i­gra­tion, fail­ure of economies to serve a grow­ing pop­u­la­tion through cre­ation of jobs, use of cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy to re­place work­ers and a poorly struc­tured in­for­mal sec­tor are some of the prom­i­nent labour mar­ket rigidi­ties that are trou­bling de­vel­op­ing economies. It is un­for­tu­nate that the use of cap­i­tal and the fourth in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion (the rise of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and tech­nol­ogy) are ad­vanc­ing at an alarm­ing stage with em­ploy­ees be­ing re­placed eas­ily by more ef­fi­cient tech­nol­ogy. There is need to de­velop so­cial con­tracts which re­fer to these ex­is­ten­tial is­sues so that the hu­man com­po­nent in work is not erad­i­cated com­pletely. With eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, the large com­mon mar­kets give room for ne­go­ti­at­ing bet­ter so­cial con­tracts as in­vestors are will­ing to choose a trade off with keep­ing work­ers in em­ploy­ment at the ben­e­fit of ac­cess to mas­sive com­mon mar­kets. With­out in­te­gra­tion, stand alone economies do not have lever­age at the bar­gain­ing ta­ble as they have noth­ing to off­set heavy taxes and min­i­mum wages that they may re­quire in­vestors to ad­here to as re­sponse to solv­ing labour mar­ket rigidi­ties. Job-rich in­dus­tries such as sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture must also be pri­ori­tised. Min­ing and con­ven­tional agri­cul­ture, on the other hand, have failed to solve labour mar­ket rigidi­ties as busi­nesses are largely de­pen­dent on cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy to re­place labour and re­duce costs. Man­u­fac­tur­ing may have the ca­pa­bil­ity to ab­sorb more labour but un­for­tu­nately de­vel­op­ing economies have lim­ited in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and are fair­ing poorly in light of com­pe­ti­tion from global man­u­fac­tur­ing en­ti­ties from the ad­vanced economies. The US has a pop­u­la­tion of over 300 mil­lion, China and In­dia ex­ceed one bil­lion and Europe is over 500 mil­lion in terms of the pop­u­la­tion. With­out ac­cess to large com­mon mar­kets, lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ers will fail in the face of global com­peti­tors and labour mar­ket rigidi­ties will per­sist. Ad­dress­ing rigidi­ties in the labour mar­ket whilst over­look­ing the need for eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion may be a waste of time and re­sources be­cause what­ever out­come se­cured may not be sus­tain­able. In­come in­equal­ity may be re­ferred to as the un­even­ness of the dis­tri­bu­tion of in­come and wealth through­out the pop­u­la­tion. South Africa is char­ac­terised by se­vere in­come in­equal­i­ties and its neigh­bour Zim­babwe might not have se­vere in­equal­ity but the Zim­bab­wean pop­u­la­tion has very mod­est and unenviable GDP per capita. The prob­lem with struc­tural in­come in­equal­ity is that it lim­its eco­nomic growth through suf­fo­cat­ing the amount of per­sonal con­sump­tion ex­pen­di­ture that is avail­able to the econ­omy. Con­sump­tion is usu­ally a large con­trib­u­tor to­wards eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. The rich usu­ally hoard their wealth and keep it in the form of fi­nan­cial and other as­sets whereas the less priv­i­leged spend al­most all of what they earn. As a re­sult, sti­fling in­come ac­cru­ing to the mid­dle class and the poor will sti­fle an econ­omy’s abil­ity to grow. If in­come in­equal­ity is cou­pled with fi­nan­cial dereg­u­la­tion it has been seen that it can cause eco­nomic in­sta­bil­ity and fi­nan­cial mar­ket crashes. This was, for in­stance, the case with the 2008 fi­nan­cial crash. The poor and mid­dle class where con­sis­tently in debt whilst the rich were pur­chas­ing fi­nan­cial and other as­sets to pre­serve their wealth and re­port­edly for spec­u­la­tive pur­poses. As­set prices then surged and with that, the poor were un­able to ser­vice their loans lead­ing to what was termed as an “as­set bub­ble”. The re­sult was mas­sive bank fail­ures and the global re­ces­sion of 2008. Re­turn­ing to de­vel­op­ing economies, there is need to avert in­equal­ity by us­ing tra­di­tional ap­proaches such as pro­gres­sive tax,",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190324,In­no­va­tion can guide Zim to pros­per­ity,"In­no­va­tive ways that im­prove the ease of do­ing busi­ness, for ex­am­ple, will also have a “pull ef­fect” in at­tract­ing both for­eign and do­mes­tic in­vest­ment. BY now it should be crys­tal clear that the “Zim­babwe we want” will not be re­alised by ex­tend­ing beg­ging bowls for aid to our tra­di­tional Western mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment part­ners and donors. In­stead, Zim­bab­weans should look in­wards and come up with home-grown dis­rup­tive and in­no­va­tive solutions that lever­age on what the coun­try al­ready has — its peo­ple, hu­man cap­i­tal, land, nat­u­ral re­sources — and use that as a foun­da­tion to spur growth and pros­per­ity. No mat­ter how “well-dressed and re­hearsed” Zim­babwe can ap­pear be­fore in­ter­na­tional mul­ti­lat­eral fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, events over the last few months (and years) have shown that Zim­babwe can never win their hearts. There are al­ways fleet­ing new con­di­tions at ev­ery turn. Goal posts are shifted time and again. This makes our re­peated trips to Washington, London, Paris, Brus­sels — the cap­i­tals of western cap­i­tal­ism — a wild goose chase. To prove my point, Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube has just re­turned from Washington empty-handed. As he headed for Washington in March, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, on March 4 2019, is­sued an Ex­ec­u­tive Or­der 13288 on the con­tin­u­a­tion of the na­tional emer­gency with re­spect to Zim­babwe by a year, claim­ing the Zim­babwe sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues to pose an “un­usual and ex­tra­or­di­nary threat” to US for­eign pol­icy. This comes barely seven months af­ter Pres­i­dent Trump re­newed the Zim­babwe Democ­racy and Eco­nomic Re­cov­ery Act (Zidera) in Au­gust 2018. US Of­fice of For­eign As­sets Con­trol (OFAC) of the US Depart­ment of the Trea­sury ad­min­is­ters and en­forces eco­nomic and trade sanc­tions. Zidera de­nies Zim­babwe ac­cess to US mar­kets as well as ben­e­fits from AGOA (African Growth and Op­por­tu­nity Act), an Act which was pro­mul­gated by US Congress in 2000 to pro­mote trade be­tween African coun­tries and the US. The Euro­pean Union (EU) on Fe­bru­ary 19, 2019 also ex­tended sanc­tions on Zim­babwe by an­other year. EU and US sanc­tions block Zim­babwe from ac­cess­ing in­ter­na­tional de­vel­op­ment fi­nance, be it by the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other mul­ti­lat­eral de­vel­op­ment in­sti­tu­tions such as Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co-op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD), in­clud­ing De­vel­op­ment As­sis­tance Com­mit­tee (DAC) coun­tries, of­ten re­ferred to as the ma­jor donor coun­tries. Time and again, our tra­di­tional Western de­vel­op­ment part­ners have ex­pressed in­ter­est to sup­port Zim­babwe ar­rears clear­ance road map, but they have not made com­mit­ments to ex­tend new lines of credit or of­fer debt re­lief; thus, keep­ing us in a per­pet­ual debt trap. Zim­babwe still re­mains sad­dled with a huge for­eign debt of US$8,1 bil­lion. Given the above back­ground, it is, there­fore, not sur­pris­ing that, apart from shak­ing hands and photo shoots with the IMF boss Chris­tine La­garde, noth­ing much was ex­pected to come from the Fi­nance Min­is­ter’s trip to Washington this month. So what lessons can be learnt from all this? Does this mean that Zim­babwe should di­vorce it­self from the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial sys­tem? Should Zim­babwe con­tinue ex­tend­ing beg­ging bowls to the IMF, World Bank and DAC coun­tries? What can Zim­babwe do dif­fer­ently to achieve growth and pros­per­ity? What the above ex­poses is that as a na­tion, while we can­not di­vorce our­selves from the global fi­nan­cial ar­chi­tec­ture, we can­not at the same time con­tinue to knock on the doors of tra­di­tional Western de­vel­op­ment part­ners when each time we do so, the doors are not opened. Al­ter­na­tive de­vel­op­ment part­ners We should move away from tra­di­tional means of se­cur­ing de­vel­op­ment fi­nance. We need new partnerships, new ways of do­ing busi­ness and win-win deals that ben­e­fit us. Zim­babwe should widen its op­tions. Western coun­tries gen­er­ally have dou­ble stan­dards for Africa and of­ten use de­vel­op­ment fi­nance to serve their po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­ter­ests. Western de­vel­op­ment aid ap­proach in Africa is now con­sid­ered out­dated. Zim­babwe should start look­ing at al­ter­na­tive de­vel­op­ment part­ners such as BRICS (Brazil, In­dia, Rus­sia and China and South Africa). BRICS, through the New De­vel­op­ment Bank (NDB), of­fers de­vel­op­ment aid al­ter­na­tives to devel­op­ing coun­tries. Zim­babwe should also strengthen its bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with other African coun­tries. Suf­fice to say, Bi-Na­tional sum­mits are very im­por­tant. In­struc­tively, in Fe­bru­ary Gaborone and Harare signed six bi­lat­eral agree­ments. Sim­i­lar agree­ments with South Africa — our big­gest trad­ing part­ner — are now more than 45. Our ef­forts should not end there. The African Con­ti­nen­tal Free Trade Area (CFTA) launched on March 21 2018 is set to im­prove in­tra-African trade. How­ever, it is only in­no­va­tive African coun­tries that will ben­e­fit from this trade bloc — which will be­come the world’s big­gest — in­te­grat­ing 55 coun­tries with 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple and a com­bined GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) of US$3 tril­lion. In­no­va­tion Aid can­not cre­ate the Zim­babwe we want. It can only be built pri­mar­ily by our own peo­ple and re­sources. In­no­va­tion can bring about change in a rel­a­tively short pe­riod of time and even in out­stand­ingly dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances. It can help us lever­age on our abun­dant nat­u­ral and peo­ple re­sources and use them to our ad­van­tage in devel­op­ing an in­clu­sive eco­nomic sys­tem that ben­e­fits all Zim­bab­weans. We have seen how dis­rup­tive tech­nolo­gies such as blockchain, dig­i­tal and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence have changed the face of global fi­nan­cial ser­vices. Sim­i­larly, in­no­va­tion will al­low us to change the face of our great coun­try. As Brett Chulu, a Zim­bab­wean re­searcher and man­age­ment con­sul­tant puts it, dis­rup­tive in­no­va­tion changes the ac­cepted tra­di­tional mod­els of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. In­no­va­tion has a “pull-in ef­fect”, mean­ing that if we come up with in­no­va­tive eco­nomic ideas, the nec­es­sary in­fra­struc­ture and sup­port­ing eco­nomic net­works and in­vest­ments will flow into the coun­try. In other words, in­no­va­tion in all sec­tors of the econ­omy (min­ing, agri­cul­ture, en­ergy, health, ICT, tourism) cre­ates op­por­tu­ni­ties and at­tracts (pulls) in­vest­ments and, thus, has a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on de­vel­op­ment out­comes. In­no­va­tive ways that im­prove the ease of do­ing busi­ness, for ex­am­ple, will also have a “pull ef­fect” in at­tract­ing both for­eign and do­mes­tic in­vest­ment. His­tory is full of ex­am­ples of in­no­va­tive coun­tries that have looked in­wards and used what­ever re­sources at their dis­posal to spur de­vel­op­ment. We have seen the “pull ef­fect” work in China, Sin­ga­pore and United Arab Emi­rates, to men­tion a few coun­tries. Re­sources Zim­babwe’s abun­dant nat­u­ral and min­eral re­sources have not changed our eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion dras­ti­cally be­cause we have not been in­no­va­tive enough to make these re­sources work to our ben­e­fit. In­stead, we have per­pet­u­ated colo­nial mod­els that con­demned us to the ex­trac­tive sec­tor, where min­ers have been con­cen­trat­ing on ex­port­ing low-value pri­mary prod­ucts. This model ex­ports jobs and fac­to­ries to Europe and the US. We need to think afresh and come up with in­no­va­tive ideas, plans and mod­els that dis­rupt these in­her­ited colo­nial legacies and old eco­nomic mod­els. Cor­rup­tion has made things even worse for us. The Zim­babwe we want can­not be built if we do not get rid of this can­cer. The scourge is now con­sid­ered to be one of the ma­jor threats to so­cio-eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion We need to think strate­gi­cally and come up with in­no­va­tive meth­ods to add value to var­i­ous sec­tors of the econ­omy. It will en­able us to cre­ate qual­ity fin­ished prod­ucts, open fac­to­ries and cre­ate thou­sands of jobs for our youths at home and bring an end to high un­em­ploy­ment rates. As a coun­try, we have talked about this count­less times. All that is needed is strong po­lit­i­cal will to drive the process. We need to come up with a ro­bust ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion pol­icy in the same way South Africa has done. Botswana sorts and pol­ishes its own di­a­monds through Deb­swana Di­a­mond Com­pany, which is 51 per­cent owned by the Botswana gov­ern­ment, while De Beers holds the re­main­ing stake. In fact, De Beers has since moved its di­a­mond sort­ing and trad­ing divi­sion from London to Gaborone in an ef­fort to stim­u­late the do­mes­tic di­a­mond in­dus­try, in­clud­ing nu­mer­ous down­stream ser­vice in­dus­tries. Zim­babwe should also look at other in­no­va­tive strate­gies to en­able the coun­try to de­rive more value from min­er­als. These in­no­va­tions in­clude barter deals, fu­tures, swaps and ty­ing com­modi­ties to in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. For ex­am­ple, in 2018 Ghana signed a US$2 bil­lion swap agree­ment with China through which par­ties made a com­mit­ment to de­velop an in­te­grated baux­ite in­dus­try in­fra­struc­ture that would al­low Ghana to pro­duce fin­ished alu­minium prod­ucts and ex­port them back to China as pay­back for the loan. The in­te­grated baux­ite in­dus­try in Ghana en­abled the coun­try to de­velop its in­fra­struc­ture and set up in­dus­tries at home; thus, cre­at­ing jobs and re­duc­ing the lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment and poverty. Fis­cal Dis­ci­pline Gov­ern­ment also needs to be dis­ci­plined. For ex­am­ple, Gov­ern­ment’s spend­ing ap­petite should be man­aged be­cause fis­cal in­dis­ci­pline threat­ens eco­nomic sta­bil­ity and re­cov­ery. Fis­cal dis­ci­pline should al­ways take prece­dence over po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­di­ency. A law that puts a ceil­ing for the bud­get deficit, say 3-5 per­cent of GDP, so that Gov­ern­ment can be held ac­count­able and its ap­petite for un­bud­geted ex­pen­di­ture brought in check. With­out such tough fis­cal mea­sures, well-in­ten­tioned eco­nomic re­forms will not bear fruit. In­clu­sive econ­omy Fur­ther, the Zim­babwe we want can be achieved through cre­at­ing an in­clu­sive econ­omy. We need to trans­form the en­tire eco­nomic sys­tem and pat­terns of own­er­ship of wealth in or­der to cre­ate broad-based in­clu­sive econ­omy that ben­e­fits all Zim­bab­weans. Through in­no­va­tion, en­trepreneur­ship, dis­ci­pline, hard work, na­tional co­he­sion and a self­less and ded­i­cated vi­sion­ary lead­er­ship, we can cre­ate the Zim­babwe we want. ◆ Allen Cho­ruma can be con­tacted on email: hozi­ad­vi­sory2018@gmail.com",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190721,Bret­ton Woods at 75: Threats to global co-op­er­a­tion,"THE se­cond world war was not yet won. Yet al­ready the west­ern pow­ers — the US, above all — were think­ing about how to or­gan­ise things dif­fer­ently for the bet­ter world that had to lie ahead. The world has changed enor­mously since then. To­day, the spirit that an­i­mated the con­fer­ence is em­bat­tled. Yet it re­mains as rel­e­vant as it was in 1944. This an­niver­sary is more than an ar­bi­trary mo­ment: it is an oc­ca­sion for re­flec­tion, on what has gone right, what has gone wrong and what needs to hap­pen if the spirit of Bret­ton Woods is to shape the world in the decades ahead or fail, as the League of Na­tions did be­tween the two world wars. An im­pres­sive col­lec­tion of 50 es­says — ‘Re­vi­tal­is­ing the Spirit of Bret­ton Woods’ or­gan­ised by the Wash­ing­ton-based Bret­ton Woods Com­mit­tee — ex­plores the for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges ahead. As Gail Kelly, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of West­pac, says: “In 2019, Bret­ton Woods reaches its 75th an­niver­sary . . .There is in­deed a lot to cel­e­brate. But grow­ing and stri­dent na­tion­al­ism, cou­pled with ar­dent pro­tec­tion­ism, are mak­ing the chal­lenge much harder.” Paul Vol­cker, for­mer chair­man of the US Fed­eral Re­serve, en­cap­su­lates the spirit of Bret­ton Woods: “The be­lief in a com­mon in­ter­est in in­ter­na­tional co-op­er­a­tion, the A key tenet of good gover­nance is ethics. Ethics sim­ply refers to a set of val­ues that bind public lead­ers and are ap­plied in re­la­tion to their de­ci­sion-mak­ing, pro­fes­sional con­duct, and re­la­tion­ship be­tween them­selves and their or­gan­i­sa­tions and the broader so­ci­ety. Public lead­ers should demon­strate high stan­dards of ethical be­hav­iour on and off the job; that is to say im­por­tance of cer­tain ba­sic rules of good be­hav­iour with re­spect to ex­change rates, and the need for devel­op­ment among the mul­ti­tude of ‘emerg­ing’ na­tions.” With the Gen­eral Agree­ment on Tar­iffs and Trade, which went into ef­fect as a pro­vi­sional agree­ment in 1948, this idea of “cer­tain ba­sic rules of good be­hav­iour” also cov­ered trade. In eco­nomic pol­icy, Bret­ton Woods means a com­mit­ment to co-op­er­a­tion, con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions among na­tions and ef­fec­tive in­ter­na­tional in­sti­tu­tions — the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund, the World Bank group and the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion. To­day, there is far more to in­sti­tu­tion­alised eco­nomic co-op­er­a­tion than these three in­sti­tu­tions. The re­gional devel­op­ment banks, cre­ated on the model of the World Bank, and, more re­cently, the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank and the New Devel­op­ment Bank, spon­sored by China, also play an im­por­tant role. Two in­for­mal groups of coun­tries have also been in­flu­en­tial: the G7 which in­cludes the seven largest high-in­come economies; and since 2008 the G20, which in­cludes the lead­ing emerg­ing economies and the EU. If we judge the era that fol­lowed Bret­ton Woods by eco­nomic per­for­mance, we have to con­clude it has been a tri­umph. In their chap­ter, Ni­cholas Stern of the Lon­don School of Eco­nomics and Amar Bhat­tacharya of the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion note that “over­all, world in­come per capita has grown by a fac­tor of four since 1950 as pop­u­la­tion has roughly tre­bled”. Be­tween 1950 and 2017 the vol­ume of world trade in­creased 39 times. The share of the world’s pop­u­la­tion liv­ing on less than US$2 a day (at 2011 pur­chas­ing power par­ity lev­els) de­clined from about 75 per­cent in 1950 to 10 per­cent in 2015. Global in­equal­ity has also fallen sig­nif­i­cantly dur­ing the past few decades, largely be­cause of the rapid rise of the large Asian emerg­ing economies, especially China and India. More­over, the world econ­omy was also far more stable than it had been in the first half of the 20th cen­tury. These ad­vances did not oc­cur be­cause every­thing went smoothly. The regime of fixed, but adjustable, ex­change rates col­lapsed in 1971, when the Nixon ad­min­is­tra­tion broke the dol­lar’s link to gold. In­fla­tion then ex­ploded up­wards in the 1970s, to be tamed, at sub­stan­tial cost, in the 1980s. Fi­nan­cial lib­er­al­i­sa­tion de­liv­ered waves of bank­ing and debt shocks, which cul­mi­nated in the global and eu­ro­zone crises of 2007-13. Bouts of pro­tec­tion­ism erupted, not least in the early 1980s in the US, in re­sponse to the strong dol­lar and the suc­cess of Japan. A trad­ing sys­tem founded on the prin­ci­ple of non-dis­crim­i­na­tion also mor­phed into one with a host of pref­er­en­tial (that is, dis­crim­i­na­tory) trad­ing agree­ments. Over­all, the Bret­ton Woods ideal of struc­tured co-op­er­a­tion worked ex­traor­di­nar­ily well. But new chal­lenges have emerged. Per­haps the most im­por­tant is the shift away from west­ern and, above all, US dom­i­nance, with the rise to su­per­power sta­tus of China. On some mea­sures, China al­ready has the big­gest econ­omy in the world. Also sig­nif­i­cant has been the rise of na­tion­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism and the con­se­quent threat of frag­men­ta­tion not just glob­ally, but also within the west. Mr Trump’s idea of “Amer­ica First” and his pas­sion­ate be­lief in pro­tec­tion­ism are a fun­da­men­tal re­pu­di­a­tion of the an­i­mat­ing spirit and in­sti­tu­tional struc­ture of the or­der the US cre­ated af­ter the se­cond world war. The emer­gence of this very dif­fer­ent spirit is, in turn, a con­se­quence of eco­nomic changes that have un­der­mined trust both in the idea of an open world econ­omy and in the peo­ple and in­sti­tu­tions that man­age it. Im­por­tant causal fac­tors in high-in­come coun­tries have been de-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, ris­ing in­equal­ity, the slow­down in pro­duc­tiv­ity growth and the shock of the un­ex­pected fi­nan­cial crises. To­day, un­like 40 years ago, it is the ci­ti­zens of the high-in­come coun­tries, not of the emerg­ing world, who are most sus­pi­cious of global eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. De­glob­al­i­sa­tion has be­gun. Cather­ine Mann, for­mer chief econ­o­mist of the OECD, points to de­clines in the trade in­ten­sity of growth and the un­rav­el­ling of global value chains since the fi­nan­cial cri­sis. This, she ar­gues, may also be one rea­son for slow­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity growth. Cross-bor­der fi­nan­cial flows also peaked in 2007. An­other shift is grow­ing pres­sures on the en­vi­ron­ment, especially cli­mate change. The world, it is now ar­gued, has moved from the Holocene to the An­thro­pocene: a planet largely shaped, both for good and ill, by hu­man ac­tiv­ity. To this must be added tech­no­log­i­cal change. More re­cently, these are un­der­min­ing the com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in labour-in­ten­sive man­u­fac­tur­ing. They are threat­en­ing large-scale dis­rup­tion to pat­terns of em­ploy­ment. They are cre­at­ing new cross-bor­der flows, no­tably of data. They are trans­form­ing pay­ment sys­tems and are likely to have even big­ger ef­fects on mon­e­tary sys­tems. So how is a co-op­er­a­tive global eco­nomic or­der to be sus­tained? This ques­tion can be ad­dressed nar­rowly, in terms of in­sti­tu­tional pur­pose and ar­chi­tec­ture, and more broadly, in terms of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. The fo­cus of the es­says is on the for­mer. It in­cludes the man­age­ment of mon­e­tary and fi­nan­cial sys­tems, the fu­ture of devel­op­ment pol­icy and the prospects for the WTO and world trade, which were all part of the de­bates at and around Bret­ton Woods. It in­cludes newer ar­eas for co-op­er­a­tion, such as cor­rup­tion, cli­mate change, frag­ile states, mi­gra­tion and tech­nol­ogy. One tra­di­tional is­sue is the re­liance on the US dol­lar in the global mon­e­tary sys­tem. This was un­re­solved at Bret­ton Woods, when John May­nard Keynes pro­posed a global cur­rency. In this vol­ume, Jean-Claude Trichet, for­mer pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank, ar­gues that a supra­na­tional cur­rency re­mains im­pos­si­ble. But a big­ger role for SDR (spe­cial draw­ing rights — a re­serve as­set cre­ated within the IMF) is not. Man­ag­ing the global mon­e­tary sys­tem as China’s ren­minbi be­comes more im­por­tant. An­other well-known is­sue is fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity. On this, Mark Car­ney, gov­er­nor of the Bank of Eng­land and for­mer chair of the Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Board, is boldly op­ti­mistic: “The rad­i­cal pro­gramme of G20 re­forms has made the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem safer, sim­pler and fairer.” Whether it has made it suf­fi­ciently safer will only be known in time. A de­press­ingly fa­mil­iar is­sue is the fu­ture of the trad­ing sys­tem. Global lib­er­al­i­sa­tion has halted. The US has not only moved in a de­ci­sively pro­tec­tion­ist di­rec­tion, but has con­tra­vened the let­ter and spirit of the WTO. It has also sought to neuter the dis­pute set­tle­ment sys­tem of the WTO by ren­der­ing it in­quo­rate. On devel­op­ment, Sri Mulyani In­drawati, In­done­sian fi­nance min­is­ter and for­mer chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer at the World Bank, em­pha­sises the need for vast in­vest­ment if to­day’s am­bi­tious “sus­tain­able devel­op­ment goals” are to be met. Di­rect fund­ing by mul­ti­lat­eral devel­op­ment banks, including the new Chi­nese-led ones, will be to­tally in­ad­e­quate. Fund­ing will have to come largely from the pri­vate sec­tor. David Miliband, head of the In­ter­na­tional Res­cue Com­mit­tee and for­mer UK for­eign sec­re­tary, stresses that “more than 40 per­cent of the ex­tremely poor now live in con­flict-af­fected or frag­ile states”. This is also the ori­gin of much of the global mi­gra­tion pres­sure. Thus, if ex­treme poverty and the flood of refugees are to be elim­i­nated, such con­flicts need to be ad­dressed. So, too, he ar­gues, does the pres­sure on the rel­a­tively poor coun­tries that are now host to 84 per­cent of the world’s refugees. Cli­mate change is mak­ing such prob­lems worse. Yet self­ish high-in­come coun­tries, no­tably the US, have ap­par­ently de­cided not to tackle this chal­lenge. Sanc­tions on such be­hav­iour may have to be con­sid­ered. An­other im­por­tant chal­lenge is cor­rup­tion, dis­cussed by Frank Vogl, co-founder of Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional, and Wil­liam Rhodes, for­mer se­nior ad­viser at Cit­i­group. They write that “IMF of­fi­cials pri­vately con­cede that they need to do more by ex­plic­itly rais­ing is­sues of il­licit fi­nance with the gov­ern­ments of ma­jor west­ern de­vel­oped economies, whose cap­i­tal mar­kets pro­vide safe in­vest­ment havens for so much of the il­licit cash.” Yes, that in­cludes, above all, Amer­i­can and Bri­tish cap­i­tal mar­kets. These per­fectly proper ques­tions about how in­sti­tu­tions are to be re­formed and new chal­lenges to be tack­led, including the need to re­flect changes in global power in in­sti­tu­tional gover­nance, are, to a de­gree, sec­ondary. The big­ger ques­tion is whether the nec­es­sary level of co-op­er­a­tion is to be sus­tained at all. To­day’s eco­nomic chal­lenges are met by a resur­gent na­tion­al­ism. Yet coun­tries are not is­lands. If any­thing, global co-op­er­a­tion is more im­por­tant to­day than 75 years ago. But it has also be­come more dif­fi­cult. The “re­al­ist” school will tell us that co-op­er­a­tion is a pipe dream: in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions are al­ways about the bru­tal pol­i­tics of power. But is a sys­tem “re­al­is­tic” if it leads to dis­as­trous results for every­body? Only if con­flict is the only imag­in­able sys­tem. Now that the world does not have a dom­i­nant su­per­power, the old hi­er­ar­chi­cal US-led sys­tem is no longer fea­si­ble. But some sort of co-op­er­a­tive sys­tem is still es­sen­tial. Keyu Jin of the Lon­don School of Eco­nomics, one of only two Chi­nese con­trib­u­tors, lays out a novel way of think­ing about this chal­lenge. She ar­gues that eco­nomic net­works may su­per­sede re­la­tions among na­tions and ren­der tra­di­tional notions of hege­mony re­dun­dant. China, she sug­gests, may end up not as an­other hege­mon but as a “global net­work leader”. The big point Prof Jin makes is a cen­tral one: how do we cre­ate enough or­der and co-op­er­a­tion to sus­tain our com­plex, in­ter­de­pen­dent and en­vi­ron­men­tally stressed world, with­out a hege­mon most coun­tries want to fol­low? It can only be through net­works of net­works, set within global com­mit­ments. Bret­ton Woods shaped the post-se­cond world war era not so much be­cause of the spe­cific agree­ments reached, but be­cause of the com­mit­ment to in­sti­tu­tion­alised co-op­er­a­tion it em­bod­ied. This com­mit­ment has re­mained vi­tal, through the twists and turns of the sub­se­quent 75 years. And re­mains as im­por­tant as ever. In­sti­tu­tions must in­deed de­velop. New chal­lenges must be met. Yet if the world is un­able to sus­tain and de­velop the un­der­ly­ing com­mit­ment to co-op­er­a­tion, global progress may not be sus­tained and the chal­lenges we con­front may not be met. Mor­gen­thau was cor­rect. Mr Trump is wrong. It is as sim­ple — and as dif­fi­cult — as that. — Fi­nan­cial Times.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20210103,Busi­ness’ role in so­ci­ety in 2020,"THE year 2020 was in­cred­i­bly rough, but with one big bright spot at the end. A once-in-a-cen­tury global pan­demic — an un­fath­omable tragedy — dev­as­tated lives and economies. But in a mirac­u­lous dis­play of sci­en­tific prow­ess, Pfizer, Moderna, and other phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies pro­duced what ap­peared to be highly ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cines by De­cem­ber. Af­ter a year of loss, there was a fresh glim­mer of hope. But while Covid has been the story of the year, it is far from the only story — our other mega-chal­lenges con­tin­ued and, un­for­tu­nately, grew larger. Eco­nomic in­equal­ity be­came even more stark. Af­ter decades of the top in­come earners get­ting all the wealth gains — about $50 tril­lion in the US alone — it got worse. During the pan­demic, US bil­lion­aires gained one tril­lion in wealth. Cli­mate change hit harder than ever with big­ger storms, heat waves, and fires of record-break­ing scale in Aus­tralia and Cal­i­for­nia. 2020 is on track to be the hottest year on record. In re­sponse to the eco­nomic crises of the pan­demic, gov­ern­ments opened the taps. Coun­tries in­jected about US$20 tril­lion of stim­u­lus into the econ­omy — about a quar­ter of the global GDP — to keep peo­ple and busi­nesses afloat. With that much cap­i­tal, and our other crises loom­ing, many peo­ple called for the world to “build back bet­ter” — that is, cleaner, more just, more sus­tain­able — a slo­gan then-US pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den adopted as well. Fi­nally, US protests over po­lice bru­tal­ity sparked a global con­ver­sa­tion about racial in­jus­tice. So, a lot more than usual hap­pened this year. Which means busi­ness has changed for­ever. No list could cover all that tran­spired, but here are 10 sto­ries and themes that caught my at­ten­tion. 1. Covid slowed down progress on sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment. Coun­tries and com­pa­nies had been mak­ing steady progress on most of the world’s ills, even if not fast enough for what sci­ence de­mands. But a July UN report on the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals (SDGs) showed a painful re­ver­sal in al­most ev­ery in­di­ca­tor. For the first time in 20 years, the num­ber of peo­ple in ex­treme poverty rose. Hun­dreds of mil­lions of jobs were lost or re­duced. Women in par­tic­u­lar took a hard hit on decades of progress to­ward equal­ity in the work­place. Iron­i­cally, the only im­prove­ment was in green­house gas emis­sions. The eco­nomic shut­down re­duced emis­sions by about 7 per­cent, but that high­lighted the chal­lenge we face: we need to do that ev­ery year to avoid the worst out­comes of a chang­ing cli­mate. Busi­ness and gov­ern­ments pur­su­ing sus­tain­abil­ity will have to work harder than ever now. 2. Busi­ness in­no­vated to help the world cope with Covid. As the pan­demic ramped up, global supply chains were stressed like never be­fore. Items we needed most, med­i­cal equip­ment like masks and gloves, were of­ten pro­duced in lo­ca­tions — such as Wuhan, China — that were, iron­i­cally, shut down by the virus. And we ran out of things. Com­pa­nies of all sizes had to ad­just quickly and went into over­drive to shift pro­duc­tion and pro­vide med­i­cal equip­ment and sup­port. Con­sider these rep­re­sen­ta­tive ex­am­ples out of the count­less sto­ries of quick op­er­a­tional changes and unusual col­lab­o­ra­tions. Com­pa­nies such as P&G rad­i­cally in­creased pro­duc­tion of hand sani­tiser and oth­ers, such as LVMH, con­verted per­fume fac­to­ries to help meet surg­ing de­mand for the gel. Ap­ple’s part­ner, Fox­conn, made ven­ti­la­tors and face shields. Ford col­lab­o­rated with 3M to build res­pi­ra­tors and with GE and the United Auto Work­ers on ven­ti­la­tors. Med­i­cal de­vice leader Medtronic made pro­duc­tion eas­ier for all by pub­licly shar­ing its de­signs specs for one of its ven­ti­la­tors. Many ap­parel com­pa­nies made gowns and masks, in­clud­ing a fun ex­am­ple where Fa­nat­ics, a com­pany that makes pro­fes­sional base­ball uni­forms, made gowns that looked like team jer­seys. Fi­nally, tech giants, led by IBM and the US Depart­ment of En­ergy, cre­ated the High Per­for­mance Com­put­ing Con­sor­tium to of­fer world-class com­put­ing re­sources to serve the sci­ence com­mu­nity work­ing on the pan­demic. 3. Com­pa­nies han­dled peo­ple is­sues well . . . and badly. En­tire sec­tors, like hos­pi­tal­ity and tourism, dis­ap­peared overnight. Many food and con­sumer prod­uct brands lost all sales in com­mer­cial chan­nels, but gained in re­tail and direct-to-home. The his­toric changes meant shift­ing jobs and lots of fur­loughs and lay­offs. Many com­pa­nies han­dled it well, putting peo­ple first. CEOs took im­me­di­ate pay cuts to help save money for em­ployee salaries and ben­e­fits — Com­cast’s top ex­ec­u­tives even do­nated their whole salaries. The CEO of Airbnb, Brian Ch­esky, was widely lauded for send­ing an open, hon­est let­ter to em­ploy­ees about nec­es­sary lay­offs. And when IKEA’s busi­ness bounced back quicker than ex­pected, it re­paid nine gov­ern­ments for funds it re­ceived for fur­loughed work­ers. But other com­pa­nies were not so re­spon­si­ble. A num­ber of large UK brands re­verted ex­ec­u­tive com­pen­sa­tion to full pay within a few weeks, and some com­pa­nies fil­ing for bank­ruptcy — like JCPenny, Hertz, and Ch­e­sa­peake En­ergy — used loop­holes to en­sure ex­ec­u­tives got bonuses of many mil­lions of dol­lars . . . while lay­ing off thou­sands and shut­ting stores and of­fices. It wasn’t a good look. 4. De­spite it all, am­bi­tions on cli­mate and sus­tain­abil­ity grew. In Jan­uary, Mi­crosoft set the most ag­gres­sive cli­mate goal in the world, com­mit­ting to be car­bon neu­tral by 2030 and, by 2050, off­set­ting all of its emis­sions since the com­pany’s found­ing in 1975 — a first in retroac­tive car­bon neu­tral­ity. Google quickly raised the ante, buy­ing off­sets to can­cel its his­toric emis­sions im­me­di­ately and pledg­ing to run is op­er­a­tions with on-site re­new­able en­ergy by 2030. Ap­ple tar­geted car­bon neu­tral­ity across its en­tire supply chain by 2030, as did Star­bucks, with a de­tailed list of ac­tions to shift con­sumer and supply chain be­hav­iors. Ama­zon said it would be neu­tral by 2040 and re­named Seat­tle’s KeyArena the “Cli­mate Pledge Arena.” Land use and bio­di­ver­sity goals scaled up this year as well. Unilever al­lot­ted €1 bil­lion for land restora­tion and car­bon se­ques­tra­tion, Wal­mart said it would pro­tect 50 mil­lion acres of land and 2 589 988,11 square kilo­me­tres of ocean to help it be­come “a re­gen­er­a­tive com­pany,” and ap­parel gi­ant Ker­ing com­mit­ted to be­ing net pos­i­tive on bio­di­ver­sity, re­gen­er­at­ing six times as much land as its supply chain uses. On the so­cial side, Master­card said it will con­nect 1 bil­lion peo­ple, 50 mil­lion small busi­nesses, and 25 mil­lion women to the dig­i­tal econ­omy. 5. Fos­sil fu­els con­tin­ued on the path to ir­rel­e­vance. About 90 per­cent of the new elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion added to the grid glob­ally in 2020 was re­new­able en­ergy, with the price for build­ing so­lar hit­ting 1,5 cents per kilo­watt hour. Clean en­ergy will dis­place coal as the largest source by 2025. “Oil com­pa­nies are col­laps­ing,” The New York Times re­ported in April. The value of oil and gas giants plum­meted — Exxon, Shell, BP, and oth­ers are worth one-third of their peak value based off my cal­cu­la­tions. Orsted, a Dan­ish com­pany that has piv­oted from gas and coal to off­shore wind, is, as of this writ­ing, worth more than BP — with one quar­ter the rev­enues. Other notable sto­ries along this theme: A 116-year-old Volk­swa­gen fac­tory pro­duced its last com­bus­tion en­gine car, switch­ing to elec­tric ve­hi­cles. Unilever an­nounced it would spend €1 bil­lion Euros re­search­ing al­ter­na­tives and re­plac­ing fos­sil-fuel based chem­i­cals in its clean­ing prod­ucts. Google said it would no longer build al­go­rithms to help the oil and gas in­dus­try find and extract more fu­els. And in­sur­ance com­pany Sun­corp will stop fi­nanc­ing or in­sur­ing oil and gas by 2025. 6. In­vestors con­tin­ued to move to­ward “get­ting it” on ESG. Ev­ery year, the talk of ESG rises, but this year seemed like a tip­ping point. Like Sun­corp, a grow­ing num­ber of banks are get­ting out of fos­sil fu­els and in­vest­ing in en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial, and gov­er­nance (ESG). The year be­gan with what is now an an­nual rit­ual — a let­ter from the world’s largest as­set owner, Black­rock, to in­vestors and com­pa­nies about ESG. This year, CEO Larry Fink made the case that cli­mate change and its sys­temic risk will re­shape fi­nance. T. Rowe Price said that ESG dis­clo­sure was now the num­ber one topic for its en­gage­ments with com­pany man­age­ment. And a Mor­gan Stan­ley sur­vey showed that 80 per­cent of as­set own­ers are in­te­grat­ing ESG into in­vest­ment process, up from 70 per­cent in 2017. Mor­gan Stan­ley, along with some big in­vestors like the New York Pen­sion Fund and Mac­quarie As­set Man­age­ment, com­mit­ted to hav­ing port­fo­lios with net zero emis­sions by 2040 or 2050 (way too late since in­vest­ments lead to long-last­ing power plant in­fra­struc­ture, but it’s a start). The world’s largest sov­er­eign fund in Nor­way said it would push com­pa­nies for more ESG dis­clo­sure, in­clud­ing poli­cies on cli­mate change and goals to re­duce emis­sions. And the Rock­e­feller Brothers Fund an­nounced that cut­ting ex­po­sure to fos­sil fu­els helped it out­per­form the mar­ket. 7. The busi­ness world said “Black Lives Mat­ter.” Aware­ness of racial in­jus­tice took a leap for­ward in 2020. In many ways, Covid played a role: Black, Latino, and Na­tive Amer­i­can peo­ple in the US ex­pe­ri­enced two to four times as many cases, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, and death com­pared to white Amer­i­cans. But the cold, un­de­ni­able video of Amer­i­can Ge­orge Floyd’s mur­der was a tip­ping point. In ad­di­tion to spon­ta­neous marches around the world, nearly ev­ery or­gan­i­sa­tion felt a need to say or do some­thing to sup­port Black Lives Mat­ter and show com­mit­ment to jus­tice. Many com­pa­nies com­mit­ted to raise the level of Black rep­re­sen­ta­tion in man­age­ment and buy more from Black-owned sup­pli­ers. For ex­am­ple, Mi­crosoft pledged to buy 500 megawatts of so­lar en­ergy from and for mi­nor­ity com­mu­ni­ties and re­tailer Sephora will ded­i­cate 15 per­cent of its shelf space to Black-owned brands (a more com­pre­hen­sive list of ac­tions here). The sym­bolic moves were also im­por­tant. Pep­siCo retired an­ti­quated brand images like Aunt Jemima and Un­cle Ben and NASCAR banned the Con­fed­er­ate flag (a sym­bol of the Con­fed­er­acy during the US civil war and slav­ery) from its races. Many com­pa­nies found pro­found ways to honor the loss of life. Vi­a­comCBS’ chan­nels went dark for 8 min­utes and 46 sec­onds (the amount of time Floyd was choked to death). The most pow­er­ful state­ment I saw came from an un­ex­pected source, the site BabyNames.com. Nor­mally a happy place to ex­plore names for your new fam­ily mem­ber, the site posted a sim­ple black box with white letters list­ing dozens of black men and women killed by po­lice or white su­prem­a­cists, with the sim­ple state­ment: “Each one of these names was some­body’s baby.” 8. The def­i­ni­tion of cor­po­rate re­spon­si­bil­ity ex­panded. In May, mining gi­ant Rio Tinto ex­panded an iron ore mine, de­stroy­ing two an­cient Abo­rig­i­nal ar­chae­o­log­i­cal sites in Western Aus­tralia. The en­su­ing scan­dal ran the CEO, Jean-Se­bastien Jac­ques, out of the busi­ness. His de­par­ture was, the Fi­nan­cial Times ed­i­to­rial board de­clared, “tes­ta­ment to the grow­ing power of so­cially re­spon­si­ble in­vest­ing.” The paper blamed the board of di­rec­tors, too. The les­son is that how a com­pany treats stake­hold­ers, such as com­mu­ni­ties and em­ploy­ees, is now core to how the C-suite is judged. In an­other im­por­tant ex­am­ple this year, Dis­ney took heat af­ter it re­leased its live ac­tion film Mu­lan. Part of the movie was made in ar­eas of China that has forcibly de­tained at least 1 mil­lion Mus­lim Uighurs, one of the world’s great hu­man rights dis­as­ters. In­creas­ingly, com­pa­nies are re­spon­si­ble for a much broader def­i­ni­tion of their “im­pact” on so­ci­ety than just phys­i­cal im­pacts like pol­lu­tion or land use. Any­thing that con­trib­utes to an un­just so­ci­ety is on the ta­ble. 9. Com­pa­nies de­fended pil­lars of so­ci­ety. This year saw in­creas­ing threats to democ­racy around the world, par­tic­u­larly in the US and Brazil. But in many ways, com­pa­nies stepped up. First, there’s ac­cess to vot­ing. In the US, al­most 2 000 com­pa­nies signed on to “Time to Vote,” giv­ing em­ploy­ees paid time off to do their civic duty. Tar­get, Warby Parker, Com­pass Cof­fee, and Gap Inc.’s Old Navy even gave em­ploy­ees paid time off work at the polls. There’s also the so­ci­etal threat of vast mis­in­for­ma­tion, of­ten spread on so­cial me­dia. To try to help com­bat this, some of the world’s largest brands — an al­pha­bet of com­pa­nies from Adi­das, Best Buy, and Coca-Cola to Unilever, Vans, and White Cas­tle pulled tens of mil­lions of ad dol­lars off of Face­book. — Har­vard Busi­ness Pub­lish­ing (On­line).",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20171227,"UN bids farewell to 2017 amid chal­lenges, hopes","In the dead­li­est at­tack on a UN peace­keep­ing mis­sion in decades, 14 Tan­za­nian peace­keep­ers lost their lives in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo. LOOK­ING back on the year 2017, the United Na­tions, while try­ing hard to up­hold in­ter­na­tional peace and se­cu­rity and com­mit­ment to global gov­er­nance, has with­stood strains of se­vere tra­di­tional and non-tra­di­tional chal­lenges and threats. In the face of mul­ti­ple un­prece­dented chal­lenges and threats as well as snow­balling dif­fi­cul­ties of global gov­er­nance, the vast ma­jor­ity of the UN mem­ber states are ral­ly­ing around the lofty ideal: mak­ing the world a bet­ter and safer place to live. In ad­di­tion to aug­ment­ing tra­di­tional chal­lenges and threats, non-tra­di­tional ones func­tion­ing as ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism, nu­clear cri­sis, trans­bound­ary crimes, refugee cri­sis, drug traf­fick­ing, cli­mate change, cy­ber se­cu­rity and other global prob­lems are run­ning ram­pant, pos­ing se­vere threats and chal­lenges to the world. Among them, the nu­clear cri­sis on the Korean Penin­sula has been recog­nised as the top se­cu­rity con­cern of the year, dis­turb­ing the re­la­tions among ma­jor pow­ers. Ten­sions on the Korean Penin­sula have reached an un­prece­dented level in 2017 due to a nu­clear test and mul­ti­ple mis­sile launches by the DPRK and con­stant US-South Korea joint mil­i­tary drills. The cri­sis has also been wors­ened by the ex­change of per­sonal in­sults and con­fronta­tional rhetoric rais­ing the spec­tre of war be­tween the United States and the DPRK. UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said on De­cem­ber 15 that he was deeply con­cerned over the risk of mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion on the Korean Penin­sula. De­scrib­ing the sit­u­a­tion on the Korean Penin­sula as “the most tense and dan­ger­ous peace and se­cu­rity is­sue in the world today,” he warned: “Any mil­i­tary ac­tion would have dev­as­tat­ing and un­pre­dictable con­se­quences.” In 2017, the DPRK con­ducted ac­tiv­i­ties re­lated to its nu­clear and bal­lis­tic mis­sile pro­grammes “at an alarm­ing and ac­cel­er­ated pace,” he said, adding that over the year, the DPRK con­ducted 20 bal­lis­tic mis­sile launches. On Septem­ber 3, the DPRK con­ducted its sixth nu­clear ex­plo­sive test, in­volv­ing what it claimed was a “two-stage thermo-nu­clear weapon,” he added. UN Un­der Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral for Po­lit­i­cal Af­fairs Jef­frey David Felt­man vis­ited the DPRK on De­cem­ber 5-8, the first in-depth po­lit­i­cal ex­change of views be­tween the UN Sec­re­tar­iat and of­fi­cials in Py­ongyang in al­most eight years. But the visit seemed to have pro­duced lit­tle pos­i­tive re­sults. In re­sponse to the cri­sis, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil has once again called emer­gency meet­ings over the year to dis­cuss ways and means in the hope to con­tain the de­vel­op­ment of the sit­u­a­tion. The Se­cu­rity Coun­cil on De­cem­ber 22 unan­i­mously ap­proved new sanc­tions tar­get­ing DPRK’s econ­omy fol­low­ing the launch of a bal­lis­tic mis­sile on Novem­ber 29 that the DPRK said it could tar­get the en­tire con­ti­nen­tal US. The new re­stric­tions were meant to slash the DPRK’s im­ports of re­fined pe­tro­leum prod­ucts, fur­ther re­strict ship­ping and im­pose a 24-month dead­line for ex­pa­tri­ate the DPRK’s work­ers to be sent home. The sec­re­tary-gen­eral wel­comed the con­tin­ued unity of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, which is es­sen­tial to achieve the goal of de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion and cre­ate the space for diplo­matic ini­tia­tives aimed at achiev­ing it in a peace­ful man­ner. UN sta­tis­tics show that an un­prece­dented 65,6 mil­lion peo­ple around the world have been forced from home. Among them are nearly 22,5 mil­lion refugees, over half of whom are un­der the age of 18. There are also 10 mil­lion state­less peo­ple who have been de­nied a na­tion­al­ity and ac­cess to ba­sic rights such as ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, em­ploy­ment and free­dom of move­ment. In a world where nearly 20 peo­ple are forcibly dis­placed ev­ery minute as a re­sult of con­flict or per­se­cu­tion, said the UN Refugee Agency. The world’s fastest grow­ing refugee cri­sis evolved in Myan­mar. Driven by vi­o­lence and hu­man rights abuse, more than 600 000 state­less Ro­hingya fled to Bangladesh, where the frag­ile in­fra­struc­ture is over­whelmed. The UN scaled up emer­gency aid and called on Myan­mar to end mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions against the Ro­hingya. In Ye­men, 8,5 mil­lion peo­ple are on the brink of the world’s largest famine in mod­ern times. Wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion sys­tems are all, but de­stroyed, spark­ing a deadly cholera out­break. The UN sent in emer­gency sup­plies and urged all par­ties not to block civil­ians from hu­man­i­tar­ian aid. Four famines, in Ye­men, South Su­dan, So­ma­lia and Nige­ria, are the re­sult of un­re­solved con­flicts ex­ac­er­bated by droughts and missed har­vests. In the dead­li­est at­tack on a UN peace­keep­ing mis­sion in decades, 14 Tan­za­nian peace­keep­ers lost their lives in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of the Congo. “It is another in­di­ca­tion of the enor­mous sac­ri­fices made by troop con­tribut­ing coun­tries in the ser­vice of global peace,” said the UN chief. In Syria, six years of con­flict have left 250 000 peo­ple dead and 5 mil­lion dis­placed. Tem­po­rary cease­fires were bro­kered and the UN’s spe­cial en­voy for Syria has been work­ing tire­lessly to bring the par­ties to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble and for an end to the war. Al­most 100 000 mi­grants crossed the Mediter­ranean Sea in 2017 and more than 3 000 have drowned. Most are flee­ing poverty and con­flict in Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. More than a mil­lion peo­ple were wait­ing for a pas­sage in Libya, caught in an end­less cy­cle of abuse, ex­ploita­tion and even slav­ery. Around the world, 130 mil­lion girls are still not go­ing to school, which is un­ac­cept­able, said UN Mes­sen­ger of Peace Malala Yousafzai. “If we want to go for­ward, we have to give ed­u­ca­tion to girls and once you ed­u­cate girls, you change the whole com­mu­nity; you change the whole so­ci­ety,” said the 19-year-old Malala. Shortly af­ter the UN first Ocean Con­fer­ence, a se­ries of mega hur­ri­canes cut a trail of de­struc­tion through the Caribbean. On some is­lands like Do­minica, hardly a tree or house was left stand­ing. Sci­en­tists have al­ready seen strong ev­i­dence that cli­mate change mag­ni­fied the strength of the storms and other nat­u­ral dis­as­ters. There­fore, the UN called on coun­tries to speed up the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment. At the end of the year, global anti-ter­ror­ist pres­sure has not been al­le­vi­ated by the dis­in­te­gra­tion of the Is­lamic State, UN said. Ter­ror­ism in new forms is emerg­ing in the “Post-Is­lamic Era,” and global counter-ter­ror­ism faces new prob­lems. From sui­cide bomb at­tacks to storm­ing of cities, from ran­dom at­tacks to the use the In­ter­net, ter­ror­ist groups are de­vel­op­ing them­selves by mak­ing use of the di­ver­gence of the in­ter­ests among coun­tries, pos­ing cut­ting chal­lenges to the anti-ter­ror­ist abil­i­ties of all coun­tries. In June, the UN re­struc­tured its anti-ter­ror­ist ar­chi­tec­ture and set up a UN anti-ter­ror­ism of­fice to co­or­di­nate a global ef­fort to pre­vent vi­o­lent ex­trem­ism and other root causes of ter­ror. Strength­en­ing counter-ter­ror­ism co­op­er­a­tion has be­come an in­ter­na­tional con­sen­sus, said the UN chief. In the face of ac­cu­mu­lat­ing threats and chal­lenges, es­pe­cially in the main­te­nance of unity of the United Na­tions, China has al­ways paid at­ten­tion to strength­en­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions with other Se­cu­rity Coun­cil mem­bers and UN mem­ber states to ef­fec­tively em­body the con­cept of “wide con­sul­ta­tion, joint con­tri­bu­tion and shared ben­e­fits.” China re­spects and takes care of the con­cerns of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and prac­tices the right ap­proach to jus­tice and in­ter­ests. China has played an ob­jec­tive, just and re­spon­si­ble role for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. The es­tab­lish­ment of “a com­mu­nity with shared fu­ture for mankind” is a ma­jor in­no­va­tion in China’s diplo­macy and has pro­duced a broad and far-reach­ing in­ter­na­tional im­pact, ob­servers say. On Fe­bru­ary 10, the con­cept of “a com­mu­nity with shared fu­ture for mankind” was first writ­ten into a UN res­o­lu­tion. On Novem­ber 1, the con­cept was reloaded into two UN res­o­lu­tions. Izumi Nakamitsu, UN un­der-sec­re­tary-gen­eral and High Rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Dis­ar­ma­ment Af­fairs, said that the UN wel­comes China’s strong com­mit­ment of mul­ti­lat­eral diplo­macy, which is the “com­mu­nity of shared fu­ture for mankind.” “The ref­er­ence of ‘shared com­mon fu­ture,’ I think it is a com­mit­ment that China is mak­ing glob­ally to multi-na­tion­al­ism in gen­eral,” she said. “China will con­tinue to play a very crit­i­cal role in terms of how they work with other na­tions in the plat­form of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, one very im­por­tant plat­form for that is the United Na­tions,” she added. Since tak­ing of­fice on Jan­uary 3, Guter­res has been busy shut­tling be­tween coun­tries, prac­tis­ing “good of­fices” among con­flict­ing par­ties, at­tend­ing in­ter­na­tional meet­ings now and then, and once and again urg­ing coun­tries to join ef­forts to re­alise the 2030 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals. Over the year, he has been mak­ing tire­less ef­forts to make sweep­ing changes to the UN in hope of forg­ing a “more ef­fec­tive, flex­i­ble and re­spon­si­ble” world body to man­age the cri­sis of the 21st cen­tury. How­ever, be­cause of the con­trast­ing in­ter­ests of dif­fer­ent coun­tries and the di­verse cul­tures, re­li­gions and ide­olo­gies, UN re­form can­not be achieved overnight, ob­servers say. The United Na­tions, the 72-year-old world body, is bid­ding farewell to another ex­tra­or­di­nary year. Ob­servers have hap­pily found that while fac­ing com­mon chal­lenges and threats, the vast ma­jor­ity of UN mem­ber states have shown un­prece­dented con­sen­sus at such world con­cerns as nu­clear is­sue on the Korean Penin­sula, cli­mate change, fight­ing ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism and other ma­jor threats and chal­lenges. Although the uni­lat­er­al­ism thoughts dis­played by the United States are wor­ri­some to some ex­tent, ob­servers say, sol­i­dar­ity and unity of the UN are gain­ing mo­men­tum. This un­doubt­edly is bring­ing new hopes to the United Na­tions, which still has a long way to go. — Xin­hua News Agency.",津巴布韦

Over the year, he has been mak­ing tire­less ef­forts to make sweep­ing changes to the UN in hope of forg­ing a “more ef­fec­tive, flex­i­ble and re­spon­si­ble” world body to man­age the cri­sis of the 21st cen­tury. How­ever, be­cause of the con­trast­ing in­ter­ests of dif­fer­ent coun­tries and the di­verse cul­tures, re­li­gions and ide­olo­gies, UN re­form can­not be achieved overnight, ob­servers say. The United Na­tions, the 72-year-old world body, is bid­ding farewell to an­other ex­tra­or­di­nary year. Ob­servers have hap­pily found that while fac­ing com­mon chal­lenges and threats, the vast ma­jor­ity of UN mem­ber states have shown un­prece­dented con­sen­sus at such world con­cerns as nu­clear is­sue on the Korean Penin­sula, cli­mate change, fight­ing ter­ror­ism and ex­trem­ism and other ma­jor threats and chal­lenges. Al­though the uni­lat­er­al­ism thoughts dis­played by the United States are wor­ri­some to some ex­tent, ob­servers say, sol­i­dar­ity and unity of the UN are gain­ing mo­men­tum. This un­doubt­edly is bring­ing new hopes to the United Na­tions, which still has a long way to go. – Xin­hua News Agency",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20180316,BRIGHTER DAYS AHEAD: SAYS ED,"THE coun­try’s speedy eco­nomic re­cov­ery hinges on all Zim­bab­weans and busi­nesses em­brac­ing a shared na­tional vi­sion to come up with a “Proudly Zim­bab­wean” prod­uct saleable to the world, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has said. Of­fi­cially open­ing the 5th CEO Africa Roundtable here yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, who was the guest speaker, said the coun­try’s vi­sion is to be a pros­per­ous mid­dle class econ­omy char­ac­terised by in­creased in­vest­ment, de­cent jobs, free from poverty and cor­rup­tion by 2030. “I want to call upon ev­ery Zim­bab­wean whether lo­cal or in the Di­as­pora to come on board and help re­build our coun­try. Our na­tional as­pi­ra­tions can be speed­ily re­alised through a shared vi­sion and the cre­ation of a ‘Proudly Zim­bab­wean’ prod­uct and ser­vice cul­ture. “Zim­babwe is ours to­gether hence we all have an obli­ga­tion to build a re­silient and pro­duc­tive econ­omy un­der­pinned by en­trepreneur­ship, pro­fes­sion­al­ism and the in­ge­nu­ity of our peo­ple. Let us in our in­di­vid­ual and col­lec­tive group­ings build na­tional con­sen­sus to­wards the re­al­i­sa­tion of vi­sion 2030,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said he had en­gaged stake­hold­ers widely and was op­ti­mistic of a brighter fu­ture for the coun­try. He chal­lenged Zim­bab­weans to be pa­tri­otic and have a change of mind­set to grow the econ­omy. Cde Mnan­gagwa urged lo­cal busi­nesses to seek joint ven­tures and pri­vate-pub­lic part­ner­ships with for­eign part­ners to har­ness cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy to pro­mote eco­nomic re­cov­ery. “In this re­gard let me make an em­phatic in­vi­ta­tion to lo­cal com­pa­nies to be at the fore­front of in­creas­ing and ex­pand­ing their op­er­a­tions as this demon­strates con­fi­dence in our coun­try’s po­ten­tial and vi­sion for the fu­ture. “I urge busi­ness, in­dus­try and com­merce to take a lead­ing role in eas­ing the do­ing of busi­ness and en­hanc­ing com­pet­i­tive­ness through in­no­va­tive ICT so­lu­tions that sim­plify our daily man­age­ment and ad­min­is­tra­tive tasks,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, who launched the ICT pol­icy on Wed­nes­day, said the use of tech­nol­ogy should cas­cade to all sec­tors of the econ­omy as the coun­try mod­ernises. He urged cap­tains of in­dus­try to sup­port tech­no­log­i­cal in­no­va­tion by avail­ing fund­ing, spon­sor­ship and men­tor­ship to young in­no­va­tors, as well as sup­port link­ages in the Spe­cial Eco­nomic Zones. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa ap­pealed to in­dus­try and busi­ness to de­sign their strate­gies with re­gional in­te­gra­tion in mind, say­ing this would help in­te­grate Zim­babwe into the main streams of global trade and sup­port the “Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness” mantra. He chal­lenged busi­nesses to de­cen­tralise so as to de­velop pro­vin­cial and ru­ral economies and cre­ate more jobs in line with the coun­try’s vi­sion 2030. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said there is no go­ing back on zero tol­er­ance to cor­rup­tion and ap­pealed to in­dus­try to prac­tise good cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and show the way by in­cul­cat­ing a cul­ture of in­tegrity, ac­count­abil­ity, trans­parency and hard hon­est work. For re­al­i­sa­tion of the var­i­ous goals, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said, his ad­min­is­tra­tion is com­mit­ted to ad­dress­ing poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions that im­pede busi­ness through un­nec­es­sary bu­reau­cracy, red tape, bot­tle­necks and high costs. He said the coun­try was draw­ing lessons from economies such as China, In­dia, Ja­pan, Sin­ga­pore and South Korea. Cde Mnan­gagwa said some of the Govern­ment’s pri­or­ity cap­i­tal projects in­clude re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the Na­tional Rail­ways of Zim­babwe, du­al­i­sa­tion of the coun­try’s ma­jor high­ways and power gen­er­a­tion as these are key en­ablers in at­tract­ing for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180615,Re­brand­ing tourism in Africa,"WHILE much has been said about the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic re­al­i­ties of Africa, one sec­tor is con­sis­tently over­looked: tourism. For many African coun­tries, the sec­tor plays a sig­nif­i­cant role in the econ­omy and as the world deep­ens its in­ter-con­nec­tiv­ity, the con­ti­nent is pre­sented with a size­able op­por­tu­nity, if cap­tured. In­deed, from pic­ture-per­fect beaches and great open sa­van­nahs to bustling me­trop­o­lises full of cul­ture, Africa has much to of­fer. It is sad then that most non-Africans trav­el­ling the con­ti­nent do so ei­ther only for busi­ness, or for hu­man­i­tar­ian pur­poses. Africa has still not pen­e­trated global con­scious­ness as a vi­able hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion and ac­cord­ing to the United Na­tions World Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion (UNWTO) at­tracted only 4,2 per­cent of the world’s tourists last year. In­ter­est­ingly, the best way to ex­plain these low fig­ures is by look­ing less at tan­gi­ble as­sets like in­fra­struc­ture and power and more at in­tan­gi­ble as­sets like per­cep­tions and stereo­types. Africa’s fail­ure to re­mar­ket it­self has left the brand over­whelm­ingly de­fined by me­dia im­ages of con­flict, poverty and dis­ease. Yet for all who reg­u­larly en­gage with the con­ti­nent, the “sin­gle storey” char­ac­ter­i­sa­tion of Africa barely scratches the sur­face. Thank­fully, nu­ance is slowly be­ing added to the con­ti­nent’s voice and peo­ple like Taleb Ri­fai, ex-Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral of UNWTO, re­main pos­i­tive about the fu­ture while recog­nis­ing the is­sues at hand. “Tourism in Africa is still very novel but it is catch­ing up quickly,” says Ri­fai. “The im­por­tant thing is that the growth rate in Africa is higher than any­where else in the world.” Cur­rently Africa at­tracts be­tween 60 and 65 mil­lion tourists per year but Ri­fai predicts this fig­ure will more than dou­ble to 150 mil­lion by 2030. A large and of­ten over­looked ex­pla- na­tion of this pre­dicted growth is the ever-in­creas­ing im­por­tance of the Chi­nese mar­ket in all as­pects of African af­fairs. Last year, the UNWTO logged that Chi­nese tourists spent $258 bil­lion glob­ally, al­most twice as much as the US in sec­ond place, and $70 bil­lion more than Ger­many, France and the UK com­bined. Ri­fai ar­gues that Africa must cap­i­talise on this grow­ing phe­nom­e­non and ad­vises a move away from more tra­di­tional tourist mar­kets. “All in all, I think African coun­tries do not take the Asian mar­ket too se­ri­ously,” he says. “The over-de­pen­dence on the tra­di­tional North Amer­i­can and Eu­ro­pean mar­kets has to be re­vis­ited.” Chi­nese tourists them­selves have clearly taken to Africa as a tourist des­ti­na­tion. Ac­cord­ing to Stan­dard Bank, the num­ber of Chi­nese tourists in Kenya will hit 60 000 this year; dou­bling the fig­ure from 2015. The In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China has even launched a new credit card, in part­ner­ship with Kenya’s Stan­bic Bank, specif­i­cally for Chi­nese tourists vis­it­ing the East African coun­try. This shows great intent and should be recog­nised and built upon by gov­ern­ment and cor­po­ra­tions alike. An­other fac­tor to build on is Africa’s grow­ing in­ter­con­nec­tiv­ity. The dif­fi­cul­ties as­so­ci­ated with trav­el­ling around the African con­ti­nent - rang­ing from visa is­sues to ba­sic travel in­fra­struc­ture and flight paths - have tra­di­tion­ally de­terred tourists. Ri­fai points to the African Union’s re­cent im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Sin­gle African Air Transport Mar­ket as ev­i­dence of im­prove­ments to travel in the re­gion. Smaller car­ri­ers, he ar­gues, will now be able to fly be­tween more coun­tries, as a de-reg­u­lated mar­ket re­duces some of the fi­nan­cial bur­dens pre­vi­ously in­hibit­ing lo­cal op­er­a­tors. Fi­nally, global tourism trends are align­ing nicely with what Africa nat­u­rally has to of­fer. “It is one of the only places in the world where you have real nat­u­ral life that is well pre­served and taken care of; which is con­sis­tent with the new trends,” he says.New African mag­a­zine. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170829,Pres­i­dent con­demns re­li­gious killings,"PRES­I­DENT Mu­gabe yes­ter­day be­moaned in­ter­fer­ence by western pow­ers in the af­fairs of other coun­tries due to greed which has seen some in­no­cent lead­ers from de­vel­op­ing na­tions be­ing as­sas­si­nated. Of­fi­cially open­ing the 67th World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion Re­gional com­mit­tee meet­ing for Africa in Victoria Falls, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe cas­ti­gated Bri­tain and Amer­ica for killing the pres­i­dents of Iraq and Libya Sad­dam Hus­sein and Muam­mar Gaddafi re­spec­tively falsely claim­ing the two lead­ers kept weapons of mass de­struc­tion. He paid trib­ute to Rus­sia and China for sup­port­ing African and Arab coun­tries at the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. “Be­cause of envy of Iraq’s huge de­posits of un­der­ground oil, Tony Blair and Ge­orge Bush con­trived to kill Sad­dam Hus­sein. They looked at one man sit­ting on the mas­sive wealth and con­trived to say they were de­vel­op­ing weapons of mass de­struc­tion. “We all know he (Hus­sein) def­i­nitely had no weapons of mass de­struc­tion. The man had man­aged to unite his coun­try but he was killed. When they dis­cov­ered that there were no weapons of mass de­struc­tion, tonnes of oil had been sucked. We also had a sim­i­lar prob­lem in Zim­babwe with Blair,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said it was re­gret­table that when in­no­cent coun­tries are at­tacked oth­ers fold their arms. “As if the les­son was not heeded in Iraq, they came to Muam­mar Gaddafi of Libya. He was a friend and lover of his peo­ple who de­sired that his peo­ple de­velop and not live in poverty. He man­aged to draw wa­ter from un­der­neath to cre­ate a huge mas­sive dam for the ben­e­fit of his coun­try which is semi desert. He be­came friends with us and wanted to democra­tise the African Union to be bet­ter po­lit­i­cally and eco­nom­i­cally united,” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said. The Pres­i­dent con­demned the killing of in­no­cent peo­ple over re­li­gion. “Lead­ers take arms in or­der to get oth­ers to be­lieve that their re­li­gion is the only best re­li­gion in the world and that oth­ers who do not sup­port them must not ex­ist near them. So they must be elim­i­nated and elim­i­na­tion is not a mat­ter of say­ing we don’t like you but they must die,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said peo­ple must be guided by hu­man­i­tar­i­an­ism taught to them in dif­fer­ent re­li­gions. The Pres­i­dent re­ferred to a verse in St Paul’s letter to the Corinthi­ans which talks about the im­por­tance of love. “I am a Catholic and Catholi­cism is not dif­fer­ent from the other re­li­gions like Methodist or Angli­can. The be­liefs and com­mand­ments are the same. Within those 10 com­mand­ments, it’s not just the bid­ding about love but we must love one an­other. In the Bible which is the Bible of all churches they al­ways re­fer to the 1st Corinthi­ans writ­ten by St Paul about char­ity and that is love,” he said. “It doesn’t mat­ter how much you talk about it if you don’t have it in your heart and hav­ing it in your heart doesn’t mean keep­ing but ex­er­cis­ing what you be­lieve in your heart in prac­tice and show­ing love to oth­ers, oth­er­wise you are just like a tin­kling brass.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said he was wor­ried about the dis­ap­pear­ance and fail­ure by Nige­ria to trace more than 200 in­no­cent school girls al­legedly ab­ducted by Boko Haram in Nige­ria in 2014.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180424,Hu­man Rights Watch and child labour in Zim,"THREE sig­nif­i­cant events seem­ingly un­re­lated but con­nected in ac­tual fact, al­beit indi­rectly, hap­pened in the past three weeks. The big­gest news was that of Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa’s his­toric visit to China, the world’s second largest econ­omy which hap­pens to be one of the top mar­kets for Zim­bab­wean to­bacco. As the cam­eras flashed in Bei­jing, all mark­ing an es­ca­la­tion of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween Zim­babwe and China in the new epoch and with Xin­hua and the re­branded China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work (CGTV) pro­vid­ing gran­u­lar de­tails about the bi­lat­eral visit in their cov­er­age, Hu­man Rights Watch was launch­ing its study ti­tled “A Bit­ter Har­vest: Child Labour and Hu­man Rights Abuses on To­bacco Farms in Zim­babwe”, back at home. The third point is that the re­port came two weeks af­ter the open­ing of the 2018 to­bacco mar­ket­ing sea­son, with its timely re­lease seek­ing to bring an­other nar­ra­tive to the spec­tre of to­bacco farm­ing in Zim­babwe, al­beit from the per­spec­tive of chil­dren’s rights. The re­port al­leged se­ri­ous use of child labour in the pro­duc­tion of the Zim­bab­wean golden leaf which has been cited as one of Zim­babwe’s suc­cess sto­ries of the post-land re­form era. Given the co­in­ci­dence of the re­lease in terms of the broader pol­i­tics at the in­ter­na­tional level in that week, there is no doubt that the study sought to gain cur­rency, much as it sought to be a timely an­tithe­sis to events in Bei­jing. Al Jazeera in­ter­na­tion­alised the story which was picked up by other pub­li­ca­tions such as the Guardian and oth­ers in South Africa and of course back at home. It is trite to note that there are nu­mer­ous in­ter­ven­tions to pro­tect chil­dren in gen­eral. The re­port’s op­por­tune re­lease and its de­tails, how­ever, had a mo­tive to use child labour as a smoke­screen for ul­te­rior mo­tives by Hu­man Rights Watch. It is telling that the back cover page of the pub­li­ca­tion has a pic­ture of a child roam­ing at the to­bacco auc­tion floors, os­ten­si­bly to show a man­i­fes­ta­tion of child labour in Zim­babwe. The study iden­ti­fied symp­toms deemed “con­sis­tent with nico­tine poi­son­ing” in­clud­ing nau­sea, vom­it­ing, loss of ap­petite, headaches and dizzi­ness. From a cur­sory anal­y­sis, it is dif­fi­cult to ac­cept a cor­re­la­tion against the back­drop of sci­en­tific test re­sults to lo­cate the iden­ti­fied symp­toms and the al­leged nico­tine poi­son­ing. Af­ter go­ing through the en­tire 105 pages of the re­port, break­ing pre­cept by pre­cept and line by line, it be­came clear that the re­port’s ref­er­ence to the haz­ardous con­di­tions by child labour­ers sought to con­flate an eco­nomic suc­cess story to the shoul­ders of child labour­ers. Yet de­spite these ap­par­ent flaws, Government met with the Hu­man Rights Watch in the spirit of mu­tual di­a­logue in line with the val­ues enun­ci­ated by the new dis­pen­sa­tion in terms of the state­civil so­ci­ety re­la­tions, notwith­stand­ing the con­tents of the spe­cific study, open to de­bate. Hu­man Rights Watch agreed to some of the short­com­ings, but it was water un­der the bridge be­cause the dam­age had al­ready been done, as the re­port used ques­tion­able sam­pling meth­ods. While child labour is a se­ri­ous prob­lem the world over and in vary­ing de­grees, the im­port of the re­search is ques­tion­able given: the like­li­hood of de­fy­ing ba­sic re­search ethics by in­ter­view­ing mi­nors who could pos­si­bly not have known the im­port of the re­search and the al­ready iden­ti­fied politi­ci­sa­tion of child labour in gen­eral. Though a brief sec­tion ex­plained the method­ol­ogy, the con­cerns em­a­nat­ing from the va­lid­ity of the re­search, are well founded on page 19 which cited a “dif­fi­cult en­vi­ron­ment” in Zim­babwe, in a bid to pos­si­bly cover up for the omis­sion of not reach­ing out to Government and only do­ing so af­ter the in­ter­vie­wees with to­bacco work­ers had been con­cluded. The ex­tent that the au­thors would want to re­gard Zim­bab­wean to­bacco as a “Bit­ter Har­vest” is, how­ever, cause of con­cern. The In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ILO) notes that child labour refers to work that is “men­tally, phys­i­cally, so­cially or morally dan­ger­ous and harm­ful to chil­dren”. The com­monly cited prob­lems em­a­nat­ing from child labour in­clude in­ter­fer­ence with ed­u­ca­tional op­por­tu­ni­ties. Some of the worst forms of child labour in­clude: child traf­fick­ing, serf­dom, child com­mer­cial sex­ual ex­ploita­tion, pornog­ra­phy, drug traf­fick­ing and the pre­vi­ously cited harm­ful work. In gen­eral terms, child labour is of­ten caused by poverty and dis­eases, which are some of the con­trib­u­tory fac­tors to the emer­gence of child-headed house­holds which ul­ti­mately increase vul­ner­a­bil­ity, hence re­sult­ing in child labour in its dif­fer­ent mag­ni­tudes. In a bid to as­cer­tain the ex­tent of child labour in the coun­try, the Government car­ried out sur­veys in 1999, 2004, 2008 and most re­cently in 2014. Government com­mis­sioned sur­veys generally found child labour, in­clud­ing in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor in gen­eral terms. Con­sid­er­ing the sub­mis­sions of the re­search, it is also im­per­a­tive to make an aca­demic dis­tinc­tion be­tween child labour and child work and to also un­der­stand the so­cial, eco­nomic and even the his­toric con­text. At times there is a gen­eral con­fu­sion of the two and in some in­stances, there are de­lib­er­ate mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions seek­ing to con­flate mat­ters. Our ru­ral econ­omy is largely agrar­ian, and all the agri­cul­tural pro­cesses are not iso­lated from the fam­ily or­gan­i­sa­tion. Farm­ing in gen­eral is, there­fore, a ques­tion of liveli­hood for thou­sands of fam­i­lies. The in­volve­ment of chil­dren is thus si­t­u­ated in this tra­di­tion of work, self-sus­te­nance and in­clu­sion in sub­sis­tence farm­ing pro­cesses. The re­port doesn’t fo­cus on these as­pects much, choos­ing to rather iden­tify the al­leged haz­ardous con­di­tions un­der which chil­dren work on to­bacco farms. Though cit­ing the health and ed­u­ca­tional as­pects of what are iden­ti­fied cases of child work, it would, how­ever, seem that the im­port of the study con­cerns de­cent work by way of pro­vid­ing pro­tec­tive cloth­ing and other safe­guard mea­sures to all work­ers on to­bacco fields in­clud­ing adults. These are all com­pli­ance is­sues re­lat­ing to the con­di­tions of ser­vice, wage struc­ture and com­pli­ance to reg­u­la­tion in terms of col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing agree­ments which seek to en­sure a win-win for all work­ers. Given that the al­leged ef­fects are largely med­i­cal in na­ture, it is thus im­per­a­tive to carry out sci­en­tific re­searches by the rel­e­vant bod­ies to de­ter­mine the au­then­tic­ity of the ef­fects of han­dling the golden leaf. Zim­babwe has in­stru­ments to pro­tect the rights of chil­dren, such as Sec­tion 81 of the Con­sti­tu­tion which pro­vides for the rights of chil­dren in­clud­ing from child labour. Other key leg­is­la­tions are Chil­dren’s Act (Chap­ter 5: 06) and the Labour Act (28:01). The Labour Act pro­vides for the em­ploy­ment of young per­sons with the 2015 amend­ment in­creas­ing the age of ad­mis­sion into em­ploy­ment from 15 to 16 years. This was meant to en­sure that chil­dren com­plete their stud­ies be­fore em­ploy­ment. Zim­babwe is party to sev­eral hu­man rights treaties such as the ILO Con­ven­tion No 138 Min­i­mum Age Con­ven­tion which states that chil­dren be­tween the ages of 13 to 15 par­tic­i­pate in light work. This is a min­i­mum con­di­tion and Zim­bab­wean laws are a notch higher than the in­ter­na­tional con­di­tions. ◆ Feed­back fmupa2006@gmail. com Read the full ar­ti­cle on www.her­ald.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20161213,Glob­al­i­sa­tion and its dis­con­tents Why there’s a back­lash and how it needs to change,"Glob­al­i­sa­tion is un­der at­tack. The elec­toral vic­tory of Don­ald Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of an ag­gres­sive na­tion­al­ism in main­land Europe and around the world are all part of a back­lash to glob­al­i­sa­tion. In each in­stance, cit­i­zens have up­set the po­lit­i­cal or­der by vot­ing to roll back eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural glob­al­i­sa­tion. Sup­port for Brexit came in large part from those wor­ried about their jobs and the en­try of im­mi­grants. Sim­i­larly, the Mid­west of the US — the in­dus­trial heart­land hurt by global com­pe­ti­tion — was the linch­pin of Trump’s vic­tory. But what ex­actly are these glob­al­i­sa­tions and why the dis­con­tent? A deeper ex­am­i­na­tion of global in­te­gra­tion sheds some light on how we got here and where we should go next. The rise of the glob­al­i­sa­tion agenda The roots of to­day’s global eco­nomic or­der were es­tab­lished just as World War II was com­ing to end. In 1944 del­e­gates from the Al­lied coun­tries met in Bret­ton Woods, New Hamp­shire to es­tab­lish a new sys­tem around open mar­kets and free trade. New in­sti­tu­tions such as the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund, the World Bank and a pre­cur­sor to the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion were es­tab­lished to tie na­tional economies into an in­ter­na­tional sys­tem. There was a be­lief that greater global in­te­gra­tion was more con­ducive to peace and pros­per­ity than eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism. The foun­da­tions of global eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, such as the cre­ation of the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund in 1945, were laid af­ter World War II as an al­ter­na­tive to eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism and as a means to pro­mote peace and pros­per­ity. Ini­tially, it was more a prom­ise than re­al­ity. Com­mu­nism still con­trolled large swathes of ter­ri­tory. And there were fis­cal ten­sions as the new trade sys­tem re­lied on fixed ex­change rates, with cur­ren­cies pegged to the US dol­lar, which was tied to gold at the time. It was only with the col­lapse of fixed ex­change rates and the un­moor­ing of the dol­lar from the gold stan­dard in the late 1960s that cap­i­tal could be moved eas­ily around the world. And it worked: Dol­lars gen­er­ated in Europe by US multi­na­tion­als could be in­vested through Lon­don in sub­ur­ban hous­ing projects in Asia, mines in Aus­tralia and fac­to­ries in the Philip­pines. With China’s en­try onto the world trad­ing sys­tem in 1978 and the col­lapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, the world of global cap­i­tal mo­bil­ity widened fur­ther. Global trans­fer of wealth While cap­i­tal could now sur­vey the world to en­sure the best re­turns, labour was fixed in place. This meant there was a pro­found change in the rel­a­tive bar­gain­ing power be­tween the two — away from or­gan­ised labour and to­ward a foot­loose cap­i­tal. When a com­pany such as Gen­eral Mo­tors moved a fac­tory from Michi­gan to Mex­ico or China, it made eco­nomic sense for the cor­po­ra­tion and its share­hold­ers, but it did not help work­ers in the US. Free­ing up trade re­stric­tions also led to a global shift in man­u­fac­tur­ing. The in­dus­trial base shifted from the high-wage ar­eas of North Amer­ica and Western Europe to the cheaper-wage ar­eas of East Asia: first Ja­pan, then South Korea, and more re­cently China and Viet­nam. The US and Western Europe saw a rapid dein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion as China and other coun­tries ramped up man­u­fac­tur­ing, of­fer­ing lower pro­duc­tion and labour costs to multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions. As a re­sult, there was a global re­dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth. In the West as fac­to­ries shut­tered, mech­a­nized or moved over­seas, the liv­ing stan­dards of the work­ing class de­clined. Mean­while, in China pros­per­ity grew, with the poverty rate fall­ing from 84 per­cent in 1981 to only 12 per­cent by 2010. Po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic elites in the West ar­gued that free trade, global mar­kets and pro­duc­tion chains that snaked across na­tional bor­ders would even­tu­ally raise all liv­ing stan­dards. But as no al­ter­na­tive vi­sion was of­fered, a chasm grew be­tween these elites and the mass of blue-col­lar work­ers who saw lit­tle im­prove­ment from eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion. The back­lash against eco­nomic glob­al­i­sa­tion is most marked in those coun­tries such as the US where eco­nomic dis­lo­ca­tion un­folds with weak safety nets and lim­ited gov­ern­ment in­vest­ment in job re­train­ing or con­tin­u­ing and life­time ed­u­ca­tion. Ex­pand­ing free mar­kets Over the decades, politi­cians enabled glob­al­i­sa­tion through trade or­gan­i­sa­tions and pacts such as the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment, passed in 1994. The most prom­i­nent, though, was the Euro­pean Union, an eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal al­liance of most Euro­pean coun­tries and a good ex­am­ple of an un­fold­ing po­lit­i­cal glob­al­i­sa­tion. It started with a small, tight core of Bel­gium, France, Italy, Lux­em­bourg, the Nether­lands and West Ger­many. They signed the Treaty of Rome in 1957 to tie for­mer com­bat­ants into an al­liance that would pre­clude fur­ther con­flicts — and form a com­mon mar­ket to com­pete against the US. Over the years, more coun­tries joined, and in 1993 the Euro­pean Union (EU) was cre­ated as a sin­gle mar­ket with the free move­ment of goods, peo­ple and cap­i­tal and com­mon poli­cies for agri­cul­ture, trans­port and trade. Ac­cess to this large com­mon mar­ket at­tracted for­mer Com­mu­nist bloc and Soviet coun­tries, to the point where the EU now ex­tends as far east as Cyprus and Bul­garia, Malta in the south and Fin­land in the north. With this ex­pan­sion has come the move­ment of peo­ple — hun­dreds of thou­sands of Poles have moved to the UK for in­stance — and some chal­lenges. The EU is now at a point of in­flex­ion where the previous decades of con­tin­ual growth are com­ing up against pop­u­lar re­sis­tance to EU en­large­ment into poorer and more pe­riph­eral coun­tries. Newer en­trants of­ten have weaker economies and lower so­cial wel­fare pay­ments, prompt­ing im­mi­gra­tion to the richer mem­bers such as France and the U.K. Cul­tural back­lash The flat­ten­ing of the world al­lowed for a more di­verse en­sem­ble of cul­tural forms in cui­sine, movies, val­ues and life­styles. Cos­mopoli­tanism was em­braced by many of the elites but feared by oth­ers. In Europe, the for­eign other be­came an ob­ject of fear and re­sent­ment, whether in the form of im­mi­grants or in im­ported cul­ture and new ways. Marine Le Pen, head of France’s Na­tional Front party, is one of sev­eral na­tion­al­ist po­lit­i­cal par­ties gain­ing power in Europe. But ev­i­dence of this back­lash to cul­tural glob­al­i­sa­tion also ex­ists around the world. The rul­ing BJP party in In­dia, for ex­am­ple, com­bines re­li­gious fun­da­men­tal­ism and po­lit­i­cal na­tion­al­ism. There is a rise of re­li­gious fun­da­men­tal­ism around the world in re­li­gions as var­ied as Bud­dhism, Chris­tian­ity, Hin­duism, Is­lam and Ju­daism. Old-time re­li­gion, it seems, has be­come a refuge from the ache of moder­nity. Re­li­gious fun­da­men­tal­ism held out the prom­ise of eter­nal ver­i­ties in the rapidly chang­ing world of cul­tural glob­al­i­sa­tion. There is also a ris­ing na­tion­al­ism, as na­tive pu­rity is cast as con­trast to the pro­fane for­eign. Across Europe from Bul­garia to Poland and the UK, new na­tion­alisms have a dis­tinct xeno­pho­bia. Politi­cians such as Marine Le Pen in France re­call an ide­alised past as a cure for the cul­tural chaos of moder­nity. Politi­cians can of­ten gain po­lit­i­cal trac­tion by de­scrib­ing na­tional cul­tural tra­di­tions as un­der at­tack from the out­side. In­deed, the fear of im­mi­gra­tion has re­sulted in the most dra­matic back­lash against the ef­fects of glob­al­i­sa­tion, height­en­ing na­tional and racial iden­ti­ties. In the US white na­tive-born Amer­i­can moved from be­ing the de­fault cat­e­gory to a source of iden­tity clearly mo­bi­lized by the Trump cam­paign. Re­claim­ing glob­al­i­sa­tion Glob­al­i­sa­tion has now be­come the catch­word to en­com­pass the rapid and of­ten dis­qui­et­ing and dis­rup­tive so­cial and eco­nomic change of the past 25 years. No won­der there is a sig­nif­i­cant back­lash to the con­stant change — much of it desta­bil­is­ing eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially dis­rup­tive. When tra­di­tional cat­e­gories of iden­tity evap­o­rate quickly, there is a pro­found po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural un­ease. The glob­al­i­sa­tion project con­tains much that was de­sir­able: im­prove­ments in liv­ing con­di­tions through global trade, re­duc­ing con­flict and threat of war through po­lit­i­cal glob­al­i­sa­tion and en­cour­ag­ing cul­tural di­ver­sity in a widen­ing cul­tural glob­al­i­sa­tion. The ques­tion now, in my view, is not whether we should ac­cept or re­ject glob­al­i­sa­tion but how we shape and guide it to these more pro­gres­sive goals. We need to point the project to­ward cre­at­ing more just and fair out­comes, open to dif­fer­ence but sen­si­tive to cul­tural con­nec­tions and so­cial tra­di­tions. A glob­al­i­sa­tion project of cre­at­ing a more con­nected, sus­tain­able, just and peace­ful world is too im­por­tant to be left to the bankers and the po­lit­i­cal elites. -Con­ver­sa­tion Africa John Ren­nie Short, Pro­fes­sor, School of Pub­lic Pol­icy, Univer­sity of Mary­land, Bal­ti­more County",津巴布韦

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20191025,Sanc­tions on Zim not jus­ti­fied,"THERE is no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the con­tin­ued ex­is­tence of sanc­tions by the US, Bri­tain and its al­lies in the Euro­pean Union (EU) on Zim­babwe. And, there was no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion in the first place. Again, they were il­le­gally im­posed be­cause they did not have the bless­ing of the United Na­tions (UN). All the sanc­tions have done for the past two decades is to cause the suf­fer­ing of in­no­cent peo­ple. Sanc­tions have now come to be abused as a tool to sub­ject weaker na­tions to the whims of pow­er­ful coun­tries. We are all see­ing the pain and mis­ery brought by sanc­tions im­posed by the US on Zim­babwe, Iran, North Korea and Cuba, among oth­ers. Sanc­tions are now in dan­ger of be­ing used too much and abused like emer­gency num­bers. Sanc­tions have hit Zim­babwe hard in all sec­tors. They have mas­sively hit our man­u­fac­tur­ing, com­modi­ties, agri­cul­ture, trade and fi­nance and, so­cial ser­vices with con­se­quences for all as­pects of or­di­nary life. The econ­omy has tanked sev­eral times, with our cur­rency fall­ing and prices of ba­sic goods and ser­vices ris­ing be­yond the reach of the ma­jor­ity of the poor. Sanc­tions have se­verely pe­nalised Zim­bab­wean com­pa­nies and iso­lated the coun­try from the in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial land­ing in­sti­tu­tions. There is no doubt that the sanc­tions struck and paral­ysed the heart of our Govern­ment’s abil­ity to func­tion and de­liver ser­vice to its peo­ple. Un­der the sanc­tions, the per­cent­age of Zim­bab­wean fam­i­lies liv­ing in poverty has more than dou­bled, with mil­lions left with­out ac­cess to es­sen­tial med­i­cal treat­ment and drugs, while school dropout fig­ures have risen as strug­gling fam­i­lies pulled their chil­dren out of school to al­le­vi­ate ex­treme fi­nan­cial hard­ships. Sanc­tions that seem un­re­lated to in­no­cent civil­ians of­ten have un­fore­seen con­se­quences, like the deaths that have re­sulted from poor ac­cess to drugs and equip­ment for treat­ment, ac­ci­dents on roads and other crit­i­cal ar­eas since the coun­try’s iso­la­tion from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity be­gan to limit ac­cess to spare parts and vi­tal in­dus­trial com­po­nents. The moral ar­gu­ment for sanc­tions is a tough one. For them to have any chance of achiev­ing their aim, which is usu­ally regime change, they will in­evitably re­sult in the wide­spread suf­fer­ing of or­di­nary peo­ple. Sanc­tions are jus­ti­fied when there is global con­sent on a par­tic­u­lar is­sue. Take apartheid South Africa, the moral des­o­la­tion of which needs no elab­o­ra­tion. It should be a source of shame for both the US and the UK that stood alone in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil well into the 1980s, op­pos­ing sanc­tions on apartheid. In the UK’s case, the then For­eign Sec­re­tary John Ma­jor mem­o­rably claimed that sanc­tions would only “feed white con­sciences out­side South Africa, not black bel­lies within it.” Pro­gres­sive voices within South Africa and those in ex­ile, es­pe­cially those in the in­cred­i­bly ef­fec­tive in­ter­na­tional coali­tion of anti-apartheid cam­paign­ers, not only wanted, but ac­tively lob­bied for sanc­tions. There was con­sen­sus on sanc­tions against apartheid South Africa. On Zim­babwe, there is no con­sen­sus. Africa, Asia and most other coun­tries in Latin Amer­ica are op­posed to the sanc­tions. There is sim­ply no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the con­tin­ued ex­is­tence of sanc­tions. If the ob­jec­tive is the em­pow­er­ment of the civil­ian pop­u­la­tion, what has the US done to lis­ten to the au­then­tic judg­ments of those who rep­re­sent them? It hasn’t done this be­cause these sanc­tions are more about US in­ter­ests than they are about im­prov­ing the lives of or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans. This hardly comes as a sur­prise, but it could well fail on its own logic. While the US is alien­at­ing the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple who are bear­ing the brunt of the wide­spread hard­ships and eco­nomic tur­moil — all the signs are that our Govern­ment will sur­vive given the sup­port and sol­i­dar­ity of China, Rus­sia, Africa and more im­por­tantly SADC. Sanc­tions will ex­actly achieve the op­po­site of what the US wants. Sanc­tions can­not be jus­ti­fied if it’s al­ready ap­par­ent that they won’t work. Caus­ing des­ti­tu­tion among the peo­ple of Zim­babwe rarely makes the world a bet­ter place. Sanc­tions are a form of vi­o­lence, which means that, as with other uses of force on the world stage, there should be a high bar to jus­tify their im­po­si­tion. The US, UK and their al­lies should be cer­tain of their prac­ti­cal ef­fi­cacy and con­fi­dent that the civil­ian price that will be paid is morally jus­ti­fied. For Zim­babwe, it’s hard to see how the US sanc­tions pass ei­ther test. To­day’s demon­stra­tion against sanc­tions is to ex­ert moral pres­sure on the US, Bri­tain and their al­lies to lift the sanc­tions. We are quite aware that ZIDERA will not be re­voked to­day or any time soon. Those with good mem­ory amongst our­selves still re­mem­ber how moral pres­sure worked against apartheid South Africa. It piled pres­sure and led to the end of apartheid. The big­gest shame in Zim­babwe is the op­po­si­tion po­lit­i­cal out­fits and op­po­nents of our Govern­ment who are not see­ing the big­ger pic­ture and ob­jec­tive of the anti-sanc­tions demon­stra­tion. They are ped­dling lies and sell­ing our strug­gle for eco­nomic sovereignty for the dime. There is no sane per­son who can sup­port sanc­tions on their na­tion. It’s a mock­ery of the suf­fer­ing of our peo­ple. Sanc­tions are coun­ter­pro­duc­tive and will not help solve the press­ing prob­lems in Zim­babwe. If any­thing, lift­ing them will help bring Zim­babwe back to the fam­ily of na­tions and put it firmly on the path to re­cov­ery and growth.",津巴布韦

Core Zim­babwe Min­ing Pri­vate Limited com­pany, one of the three com­pa­nies work­ing with Zibagwe Ru­ral District Coun­cil on the project is ex­pected to start con­struc­tion dur­ing the first quar­ter of next year. Zibagwe RDC chief ex­ec­u­tive Mr Farayi Machaya said the com­pany was mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant progress as it had so far man­aged to ac­quire land for the $200 mil­lion in­vest­ment. “I am re­li­ably in­formed they have since ac­quired a power gen­er­a­tion li­cence from rel­e­vant author­i­ties, they have the lease agree­ment from the Min­istry of Lands and they have also ac­quired a grid con­nec­tion li­cence,” he said. “So, in terms of pa­per work, they cov­ered much ground and I am sure they are now left with ac­quir­ing the power gen­er­a­tion li­cence from ZERA which I am sure they will get by end of year.” Mr Machaya said once they get the En­vi­ron­ment Im­pact As­sess­ment (EIA) done by end of the year, con­struc­tion will com­mence. “We are hope­ful that all the nec­es­sary le­gal pro­cesses would be done by the first quar­ter of 2020 and we start con­struc­tion,” said Mr Machaya. He said apart from the pa­per work, the com­pany had made progress on se­cur­ing the land for the project. “We are quite pleased with the progress made thus far by Core Zim­babwe,” said Mr Machaya. Africa Moyo THE Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion ex­pan­sion project is now 21 per­cent com­plete, with the first unit set to be com­mis­sioned by the end of the first quar­ter next year.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180817,Can the Sa­hel re­cap­ture its lost glory?,"To­day the vast Sa­hel re­gion, ly­ing be­tween North and sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa, is char­ac­terised by gen­eral poverty, law­less­ness and the pres­ence of ter­ror­ist groups. But it once formed one of the world’s busiest and wealth­i­est trad­ing routes. Can the for­tunes of this re­gion be re­vived and re­stored to their long-lost glory? ACROSS much of West Africa a trend has de­vel­oped. As the At­lantic Ocean feeds the eco­nomic pow­er­houses on the coast, the Sa­hara has given way to in­sta­bil­ity, con­tra­band and dis­re­pair. This wasn’t al­ways the case. In fact, the very op­po­site was true. Tran­sit routes criss-cross­ing the desert con­nected once-pow­er­ful ci­ties like Tim­buktu, Gao, Djenné and Kano with North Africa and the Mid­dle East. Goods like gold, salt, cot­ton, leather and ostrich feath­ers were trans­ported and traded in large car­a­vans and it was the in­te­rior that flour­ished. Mansa Musa, 14th-cen­tury ruler of the Mali Em­pire, is widely con­sid­ered as the rich­est per­son ever to have lived. In­deed, the for­tunes of great and pow­er­ful em­pires like Song­hai, Mali and Kanem-Bornu, among oth­ers, ebbed and flowed with the idio­syn­cra­sies of the trade. In the present day much has changed. The trade de­clined due to fac­tors in­clud­ing the ar­rival of Euro­pean colo­nial­ism, which prompted the move­ment of goods to­wards the coast, in­stead of through the Sa­hara. Sup­ply chains were dis­rupted and the trans-Sa­ha­ran trade and the ci­ties it once sup­ported be­gan their de­cline. Now, pol­icy-mak­ers based in the south are at odds over what to do with the ris­ing law­less­ness of the Sa­hel. Se­cu­rity im­per­a­tives fre­quently trump devel­op­ment and strat­egy is mud­dled in the ab­sence of any panacea. Yet how could a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the Sa­hel’s eco­nomic his­tory have a pos­i­tive in­flu­ence on de­vel­op­men­tal pol­icy in the re­gion? What, if any­thing, re­main of the old trade routes? And how could they be re-es­tab­lished? The trade and its de­cline While the Sa­hara has al­ways cra­dled ro­bust in­ter­nal trade, the peak of the ac­tiv­ity was from be­tween the eighth to 17th cen­turies. Over this time pe­riod the na­ture of the trade took many dif­fer­ent forms. “In terms of the peo­ples and goods in­volved, they shifted across time and space,” ex­plains Ghis­laine Ly­don, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor in the Depart­ment of His­tory at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les. A few goods and lo­ca­tions, how­ever, were key. Up un­til the 18th and 19th cen­turies, gold was traded heav­ily, re­veals Ly­don. Mus­lim and Jewish traders in North Africa would in­vest in camel car­a­vans head­ing south to places like Tim­buktu to ex­change Euro­pean goods for gold. Prior to this the Gao em­pire was recorded as trad­ing gold, pre­cious stones, an­i­mal hides and en­slaved Africans across the Sa­hara to Egypt. Cot­ton and leather were also im­por­tant com­modi­ties. Kano, in north-east­ern Nige­ria, was the cen­tre of such com­merce. “Kano was a ma­jor cen­tre in in­digo dy­ing and that kind of cloth was val­ued greatly in the north­ern Mo­roc­can mar­kets,” says Ly­don. “Mo­roc­can sultans would wear in­digo died cloth as re­galia but it was also im­por­tant within the Sa­ha­ran oases for no­madic peo­ples build­ing tents and the like.” In­deed, Mo­roc­can port-towns like Es­saouira got rich as ex­change points be­tween West African and Euro­pean mar­kets. Mo­roc­can leather, as it was known and used in Spain for pa­per pro­duc­tion, was in fact mostly sourced from Kano; also an im­por­tant cen­tre for an­i­mal hide pro­duc­tion. The trans-Sa­ha­ran trade, then, was a ne­bu­lous and lu­cra­tive web of con­nec­tions run­ning goods be­tween North Africa, West African em­pires and citys­tates and the Near East. Its down­fall mostly came about as a re­sult of the mer­can­tile poli­cies of Europe’s ris­ing eco­nomic pow­ers. “The trans-At­lantic trade re­ally ex­plains the demise of trans-Sa­ha­ran trade,” ar­gues Michael Gomez, Pro­fes­sor of His­tory and Mid­dle East­ern and Is­lamic Stud­ies at New York Univer­sity. Raw ma­te­ri­als and valu­able com­modi­ties were drawn from West Africa’s in­te­rior and ex­ported to Europe and North Amer­ica via the ocean. This was to have a pro­found ef­fect on the economies of the Sa­hel as it no longer made com­mer­cial sense to move goods through the desert. To­day, West Africa con­tin­ues to be de­fined by this eco­nomic shift. Economies are geared to­wards coastal ex­ports; push­ing wealth to the coast while the ci­ties of the Sa­hel are left ne­glected. An­other fac­tor ex­plain­ing the de­cline of the trade was the grad­ual down­fall of West Africa’s em­pires due to com­pe­ti­tion and war­fare. Morocco’s vic­tory over the Song­hai Em­pire in the 16th cen­tury se­verely im­pacted the re­gion’s abil­ity to trade and the amount of car­a­vans cross­ing the Sa­hara grad­u­ally be­gan to shrink. Routes re­pur­posed Not all of the con­nec­tions be­tween the Sa­hel and North Africa or the Near East have been lost. Gomez ar­gues that north­ern Nige­ria con­tin­ued le­git­i­mate trad­ing across the Sa­hara with Libya well into the 19th cen­tury. How­ever, this is the ex­cep­tion not the rule. “The value of goods go­ing into North Africa from north­ern Nige­ria palls in com­par­i­son to the goods go­ing to the At­lantic,” he says. How­ever, what does sug­gest a dy­namic if macabre re­pur­pos­ing of the old trade routes is the re­cent am­pli­fi­ca­tion of hu­man and con­tra­band traf­fick­ing across the desert. Some of the Sa­he­lian com­mu­ni­ties in­volved in these il­licit prac­tices are the di­rect descen­dants of ex-car­a­van­ers, ar­gues Ly­don. With very lit­tle mean­ing­ful devel­op­ment in the re­gion, these com­mu­ni­ties have ex­ploited old knowl­edge to gen­er­ate in­come and pro­vide a liveli­hood. While these Sa­hel economies are largely in­for­mal, it does sug­gest dy­namic and in­ter-con­nected mar­kets which could be use­ful to pol­icy mak­ers look­ing to de­velop the re­gion. Is­lamist in­sur­gency in the re­gion can also be di­rectly linked to the demise of for­mal trans-Sa­ha­ran trade and its as­so­ci­ated eco­nomic hubs. Although move­ments have been present in the re­gion for quite some time, the re­ac­tionary and se­ces­sion­ist na­ture of groups like Boko Haram and Al-Qaeda in the Is­lamic Maghreb can be linked to eco­nomic marginal­i­sa­tion as much as ide­o­log­i­cal goals. “These ar­eas of­fer very few op­por­tu­ni­ties,” re­marks Ly­don. “Join­ing these net­works pro­vides op­por­tu­ni­ties to pros­per in a new regime en­vi­ron­ment be­yond the cur­few of na­tion states.” One car­a­van, one 4×4 Gomez draws an in­ter­est­ing com­par­i­son be­tween any project to re­vive trans-Sa­ha­ran trade and China’s re­cent his­tor­i­cally tem­pered at­tempt to re­vive the old Silk Road in the form of the ‘One Belt One Road’ ini­tia­tive. “China is do­ing so in a very con­crete way,” he ex­pands. “This is not just about nostal­gia, it’s about mov­ing for­ward and they’re able to do it be­cause the sea routes and over­land routes still have some util­ity.” By re-imag­in­ing old trade routes through ro­bust pol­icy, then, China is hop­ing to make sig­nif­i­cant gains. Ev­i­dently China - with its enor­mous wealth and cen­tral strat­egy - has very lit­tle in com­mon with a frac­tured com­bi­na­tion of some of the world’s poor­est states. Yet the his­tory upon which the re­vi­sion­ist strat­egy is based has marked sim­i­lar­i­ties to the Sa­ha­ran ex­pe­ri­ence - only the vi­sion and ca­pac­ity dif­fer. Morocco has re­cently been mak­ing some moves in this re­gard. As men­tioned, the kingdom has an of­ten-over­looked his­tory of trad­ing and in­ter­act­ing with West Africa. King Mo­hammed VI and his gov­ern­ment have been mak­ing a con­certed push south for many years. Since Oc­to­ber 2016 he has vis­ited at least 14 African coun­tries, trav­el­ling with large trade del­e­ga­tions, and sign­ing a host of bi­lat­eral deals. The African Devel­op­ment Bank es­ti­mates that 85 per­cent of Morocco’s out­ward for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment goes to sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. Trade lags be­hind, but this too is grow­ing. Ex­ports of Mo­roc­can goods to West Africa tripled from 2006 to 2016. Whether the strat­egy is in­flu­enced by any wish to breathe life into old con­nec­tions is un­clear, but it cer­tainly mir­rors old trends. ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20191201,East Africa strug­gles with heavy rains,"Flash flood­ing has hit Dji­bouti, where the gov­ern­ment and United Na­tions said the equiv­a­lent of two years’ rain fell in a sin­gle day, with sev­eral coun­tries in East Africa, in­clud­ing Kenya, strug­gling af­ter heavy rain­fall. Rain­fall from Oc­to­ber to mid-Novem­ber has been up to 300 per­cent above av­er­age in the greater Horn of Africa re­gion, ac­cord­ing to the Famine Early Warn­ing Sys­tems Network. On Thurs­day, a joint Dji­bouti- UN state­ment said up to a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple have been af­fected in re­cent days in the coun­try on the Red Sea that is home to mil­i­tary bases for the United States, China and oth­ers. With heavy rains forecast through the end of the month, that num­ber could grow. Dji­bouti has been called one of the world’s most vul­ner­a­ble non-is­land na­tions in the face of cli­mate change as sea lev­els rise. Neigh­bour­ing So­ma­lia has been hit hard by re­cent flood­ing as well. Deadly floods in Kenya In Kenya, East Africa’s eco­nomic hub, the gov­ern­ment said 120 peo­ple have been killed in flood­ing and mud­slides dur­ing an un­usu­ally se­vere rainy season. More than 60 peo­ple died over the week­end in West Pokot county. Tens of thou­sands of peo­ple across the coun­try have been dis­placed, while in­fra­struc­ture has been dam­aged, mak­ing aid de­liv­ery more dif­fi­cult. Doc­tors are wor­ried that dis­eases, es­pe­cially wa­ter-borne dis­eases, might spread. “We have health is­sues, and it is wounds, it is chil­dren who are com­ing up with pneu­mo­nia, it is di­ar­rhoeal ill­nesses,” said Doc­tor Taabu Simiu at the West Pokot County Re­fer­ral Hos­pi­tal. ‘Life here is ter­ri­ble’ Some sur­vivors are strug­gling. “Life here is ter­ri­ble be­cause we do not have money, be­cause if some­one had their money in the house it was all swept away by the floods,”one sur­vivor, Cher­ish Li­mansin, said. “It is only poverty star­ing at us here. We woke up with noth­ing. If it wasn’t for the lit­tle help we get, we would have noth­ing and so far today we have eaten noth­ing.” One lo­cal of­fi­cial ex­pressed frus­tra­tion over re­lief ef­forts, as­sert­ing that the na­tional gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the dis­as­ter has been slow and in­suf­fi­cient. The of­fi­cial spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity as he was not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia. Two vil­lages with al­most 5 000 res­i­dents in to­tal re­main cut off from the rest of the world for sev­eral days af­ter the flood­ing, said West Pokot County dis­as­ter man­age­ment of­fi­cial Mon­icah Kaliny­ong’ar. Gov­er­nor John Lonyang’apuo said peo­ple lacked food be­cause of the slow pace of as­sis­tance, say­ing a he­li­copter should be op­er­at­ing full time for the du­ra­tion of the re­lief ef­forts. Spokesman Cyrus Oguna de­nied that the na­tional gov­ern­ment was frus­trat­ing re­lief ef­forts, say­ing Kenya’s mil­i­tary was help­ing to re­pair dam­aged roads. Drought-hit South Africa braces for fresh heat­wave Mean­while, the South African Weather Ser­vice ( SAWS) warned of a heat­wave that was ex­pected to hit at least four prov­inces of the drought-hit coun­try last week. The warn­ings stretch from Port El­iz­a­beth in the south through to Jo­han­nes­burg, Pre­to­ria and up to the bor­der with Zim­babwe. South Africa is cur­rently in late spring. While high tem­per­a­tures are ex­pected, the ef­fect of higher-than-av­er­age tem­per­a­tures along with the con­tin­u­ing drought has wor­ried the farm­ers. The re­gion’s tem­per­a­tures are ris­ing at twice the global av­er­age, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Panel on Cli­mate Change. In much of South Africa, an un­usu­ally hot, dry spring has seen wa­ter sup­plies sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce. SAWS ex­pects lower-than-nor­mal rain­fall from Novem­ber to Jan­uary over the east­ern parts of the coun­try. The rainy season for most of South Africa is Novem­ber through to March, and fore­casts pre­dict be­low-nor­mal rain­fall un­til March 2020, with higher tem­per­a­tures across the coun­try — all coin­cid­ing with the most cru­cial time for crop yields, which run from Oc­to­ber un­til Fe­bru­ary. Agri­cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tion AgriSA met ear­lier in Novem­ber to dis­cuss the con­tin­u­ing drought in South Africa, which has plagued the coun­try since 2012. Willem Symington of Agri North­ern Cape said: “The West­ern Cape, East­ern Cape, North­ern Cape and the Lim­popo area should have had a dis­as­ter de­clared more than a year ago.” Of these re­gions, three are un­der heat­wave warn­ings last week. As sum­mer sets in, the weather out­look in the coun­try is not en­cour­ag­ing. — Al Jazeera and news agen­cies",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20180805,Un­pack­ing the po­lit­i­cal econ­omy of vot­ing de­mo­graph­ics,"Both the ur­ban and ru­ral voter un­der­stands the ba­sics of money; they are just go­ing through dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences. THE just-ended elec­tion and its out­come has re­vealed the deep-seated lack of un­der­stand­ing of Zimbabwe’s eco­nomic struc­ture. Some think that vot­ing pat­terns have shown the psy­cho­log­i­cal con­di­tion­ing and back­ward­ness of the ru­ral folk and their to­tal lack of ap­pre­ci­a­tion of eco­nom­ics. On the other hand, the ur­ban voter is be­ing cast as a more ed­u­cated per­son who makes ra­tio­nal eco­nomic de­ci­sions and, thus, is more likely to make an in­formed de­ci­sion that is good for ev­ery­one. This ar­gu­ment is sim­ply flawed and be­trays an ig­no­rance to the du­al­ity of the coun­try’s eco­nomic base, where one side is presently flour­ish­ing, while the other is in se­ri­ous de­pres­sion. Both the ur­ban and ru­ral voter un­der­stands the ba­sics of money; they are just go­ing through dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences. The sooner we un­pack these dif­fer­ences, the eas­ier it would be to craft and de­sign an eco­nomic gov­er­nance model that en­sures that all peo­ple, ir­re­spec­tive of their ge­og­ra­phy, have full ac­cess to eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties that the coun­try has in abun­dance. Here are the facts: This econ­omy is mainly driven by min­ing and agri­cul­ture. Both of these are pri­mary ac­tiv­i­ties of ru­ral Zimbabwe. This year, Zimbabwe has had one of the best to­bacco sea­sons, which brought in ex­cess of $500 mil­lion. That money came largely from Mashona­land prov­inces and parts of the Man­i­ca­land. In the Lowveld, an ag­gres­sive land re­dis­tri­bu­tion pro- gramme has ben­e­fited a num­ber farm­ers from the pro­duc­tion of su­gar­cane. The cot­ton sec­tor is be­gin­ning to re­cover be­cause of im­proved prices and the in­put sup­port scheme. Gokwe and its en­vi­rons has been the ma­jor ben­e­fi­ciary. The live­stock re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion pro­gramme is now in full swing, ben­e­fit­ing com­mu­ni­ties in Mata­bele­land South and most of Masvingo, where the Cold stor­age Com­pany (CSC) is now be­ing re­opened. Gold de­liv­er­ies to Fidelity Print­ers and Re­fin­ers (FPR) by small-scale min­ers — who are fore­cast to be more than half-a-mil­lion — have now eclipsed de­liv­er­ies from pri­mary pro­duc­ers. Each month, this group earns over $50 mil­lion in hard cur­rency. Sim­i­larly, it is the same story for chrome min­ers who are spread across the min­eral-rich Great Dyke. So, quite clearly, ar­ti­sanal min­ers are very ac­tive in Mberengwa, Fi­l­abusi, Bubi and Gwanda. In con­trast, the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor — which used to be the key eco­nomic driver of ur­ban Zimbabwe, par­tic­u­larly for ci­ties such as Harare, Bu­l­awayo, Gweru, Kwekwe and Mutare — has col­lapsed. While there has been some mod­icum of re­cov­ery, es­pe­cially af­ter the in­tro­duc­tion of Statu­tory In­stru­ment 64 in 2016, the in­creased au­to­ma­tion of most plants and the un­com­pet­i­tive na­ture of our in­dus­try has meant that very few jobs have been cre­ated in this area. What we have seen then is the growth of an in­for­mal sec­tor, which pri­mar­ily re­lies on the pro­cure­ment of fin­ished im­ported goods. In ad­di­tion, we have wit­nessed in­creased mi­gra­tion by the youth; in par­tic­u­lar, to ci­ties, es­pe­cially Harare, in­flu­enced by the false be­lief that this is where it all hap­pens. Our colo­nial ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem has con­tin­ued to mis­lead young peo­ple into be­liev­ing that all that is needed is to present a cur­ricu­lum vi­tae (CV) to some­one in some posh, city of­fice. In this coun­try, the preva­lent be­lief is that “it is my right to get a job and not cre­ate one”. Fur­ther, there is strong con­vic­tion that jobs are found only in the ci­ties. What you then have from these two eco­nomic spheres is a sit­u­a­tion where ru­ral Zimbabwe has emerged as pro­ducer for a highly con­sump­tive and ex­pec­tant ur­ban mar­ket, which is to­tally de-linked from the source of its in­come. When the mon­eys from gold and to­bacco en­ter Harare, for in­stance, the pro­ceeds are “spinned” by our ur­ban “street-smarts” to make more money which is then used to im­port ‘chips’ and trin­kets from South Africa. And this be­comes a con­duit for se­ri­ous haem­or­rhage. The money that ru­ral folks toil day-in and day-out to cre­ate is sim­ply si­phoned away to ex­ter­nal mar­kets to bring in goods and ser­vices that ful­fil the as­pi­ra­tional needs of our mod­ernised ur­ban folks. The re­sult, sadly, is that Zimbabwe en­ters a vi­cious cir­cle of need, where one good turn of har­vest rarely trans­lates into sus­tain­able eco­nomic growth. The trap­pings of a global mar­ket, with its glit­ter­ing goods and loads of grat­i­fi­ca­tion tools - for ex­am­ple, cell­phones and sec­ond-hand cars - has fur­ther meant the ur­ban Zim­bab­wean mar­ket would rather con­tinue its jour­ney of self-de­struc­tive eco­nomic pur­suits than em­bark on a painful path of toil­ing to make your own prod­uct. To be fair, this is not a prob­lem pe­cu­liar to Zimbabwe. It is an Africa prob­lem. A few weeks back, I was in China on some busi­ness visit and my ex­pe­ri­ence left me won­der­ing on the eco­nomic path our con­ti­nent has cho­sen. The Chi­nese con­sume Chi­nese prod­ucts. They largely speak their own lan­guages. While most of their ur­ban young as­pire for global ap­parel, the struc­ture of their so­ci­ety has grounded them to be ex­cep­tion­ally proud of who they are. Trag­i­cally, their ci­ties are boom­ing on the back of mil­lions of African traders, most of whom con­verge there to pro­cure fin­ished goods such as jew­ellery from gold mined in Africa and clothes from cot­ton grown in Africa. These traders are ur­ban dwellers who see no con­tra­dic­tion be­tween their as­pi­ra­tions and the poverty in their own home coun­tries. In fact, they strongly be­lieve that the for­eign cur­rency they bring to China comes from their own sweat. The link be­tween the ru­ral pro­ducer, ex­ports and their money is never one in view. Africa is cause of its own poverty. Lost in all this, is that in the same ru­ral en­clave is a young Zim­bab­wean, who sees plenty of eco­nomic choices and a gov­ern­ment that has gone out of its way to sup­port these thriv­ing com­mu­ni­ties di­rectly and in­di­rectly through Com­mand Agri­cul­ture and sup­port for small-scale min­ers. For the ru­ral folk, the worry then is not about space to sell wares or scram­ble to buy the lat­est gad­get, but rather ac­cess to land, cap­i­tal, min­ing claims, de­mand for wa­ter and a reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment that does not pun­ish them for de­cent work. To find a young per­son look­ing for a job in ru­ral Zimbabwe to­day is dif­fi­cult as most of them are search­ing for se­ri­ous eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties. In the city, the op­po­site is true. Young grad­u­ates each day have to en­dure end­less frus­tra­tion in try­ing to se­cure jobs in ar­eas where man­u­fac­tur­ing is de­stroyed by im­ports that the in­for­mal sec­tor brings. Un­for­tu­nately, be­cause of the du­al­ity and seem­ing ru­ral-ur­ban di­vide, very few ever get to the point where they re­alise eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties are not in the ci­ties. The ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem has in­grained in our young that the city is the best place to be in. Beau­ti­ful ‘spaghetti’ roads, world class air­ports and speed trains be­come a fas­ci­na­tion of the world that they must live in. Ru­ral Zimbabwe is thus not a place of their dreams, but rather an en­vi­ron­ment to be es­caped from. The peo­ple who dwell in ru­ral Zimbabwe thus can only be back­ward, with­out the ca­pac­ity to make ra­tio­nal eco­nomic de­ci­sions. Most ur­ban­ites can­not en­vi­sion suc­cess in ru­ral ar­eas. They are obliv­i­ous to eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties that take place in that part of the coun­try. De­spite this gloomy pic­ture, there is a way for­ward. African gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing our own, must stop cud­dling the in­for­mal mar­ket. It is like tol­er­at­ing a drug which pro­vides tem­po­rary re­lief but has se­ri­ous long-term ef­fects. In Zimbabwe, there ap­pears to be fear by gov­ern­ment that tem­per­ing with the in­for­mal mar­ket will trig­ger strife and waves of protests. What is missed is that over tol­er­at­ing a ‘can­cer­ous mar­ket’ will never solve our prob­lems. In­stead, it will re­sult in long-term so­cial in­sta­bil­ity, where the ur­ban young may be forced to vent their anger against any­thing or any­one they be­lieve is the source of their mis­ery. So be­fore they de­stroy them­selves and the coun­try, help them by en­sur­ing that they stop loi­ter­ing the streets but get to work. No coun­try can de­velop while ne­glect­ing its eco­nomic pro­duc­tive sec­tors. Our young peo­ple must be forced off the streets and taken to work, our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem must be clear in ar­tic­u­lat­ing ex­pec­ta­tions to be re­alised in a typ­i­cal African coun­try. Just as well, we now have the Youth Bank. Its work must show.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20201018,"Birth, evo­lu­tion of debt as an in­stru­ment of co­er­cion","IT has since turned out to be a pe­riod of mourn­ing trig­gered by the death in Septem­ber of David Grae­ber, the an­thro­pol­o­gist, pro­lific au­thor, rad­i­cal thinker and so­cial ac­tivist. His 2011 sem­i­nal book, “Debt: the First Thou­sand Years”, en­er­gised both sides of the so­cio-eco­nomic di­vide in in­dices rem­i­nis­cent of “Das Kap­i­tal” by Karl Marx, 144 years ear­lier. Grae­ber be­came the in­tel­lec­tual fa­ther of the Oc­cupy Wall Street Move­ment at the turn of the mil­len­nium, among many other en­gage­ments as an avowed an­ar­chist ac­tivist. His thoughts mo­ti­vated oth­ers. He in­vited a re­lent­less on­slaught against him­self from pun­dits of the estab­lish­ment. By the same to­ken, he gal­vanised ar­dent global fel­low­ship among those who seek eq­ui­table progress for hu­mankind. His ex­tremely fas­ci­nat­ing book should be stan­dard is­sue by any self-re­spect­ing na­tional academia. It traces the birth and evo­lu­tion of debt as an in­stru­ment of so­cial co­er­cion among var­i­ous so­ci­eties over the ages. His book mined the an­thro­po­log­i­cal work of fel­low pro­fes­sors Mar­shall Sahlins and Michael Hud­son into con­tem­po­rary man­i­festos of so­cio-po­lit­i­cal ac­tivism. Grae­ber was younger than me, yet I oblig­ingly bow to him in awe. I fol­lowed him as my youth­ful long dis­tance teacher. His works added a re­fresh­ing new ex­pla­na­tion to the life I have trav­elled. I take self-ac­tu­al­is­ing pride in be­ing sit­u­ated in the Samora Machel-Soweto ’76 Gen­er­a­tion of sub-re­gional youth­ful rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies. At great pain and sac­ri­fice we changed his­tory. We re­vived the mod­ern mil­i­tary ethos of a peo­ple that had been numbed by the mass slaugh­ter from Hiram Steven’s Maxim gun in­vented in 1884 and the blind­ing ex­plo­sion of Al­fred No­bel’s dy­na­mite patented in 1867. There­after, num­bers mat­tered no more in war­fare. The cal­cu­lus of asym­met­ri­cal war waged by a nu­mer­i­cally su­pe­rior but poorly armed de­fender ceased to be of con­se­quence. A hand­ful of white in­vaders from far away Europe could now de­feat swarms of spear-wield­ing African armies. Lands could be con­quered by a hand­ful of su­per-ar­ro­gant in­vaders and these vic­to­ri­ous mi­nori­ties could wipe out or sub­ju­gate mil­lions of in­dige­nous peo­ple of a na­tion. White set­tler mi­nor­ity regimes es­tab­lished writ with saga­cious im­punity over cowed and cow­ered “na­tive” ma­jori­ties. The Marx­ian tra­di­tion of racial equal­ity changed ev­ery­thing as the Rus­sian Bol­she­viks brought about a new kind of mod­ern state sub­sist­ing on the egal­i­tar­ian prin­ci­ple of na­tions and so­ci­eties. The Vladimir Lenin Bol­she­viks of Rus­sia lost no time in up­end­ing the Euro­pean gun car­tel that was a cru­cial part of the im­pe­rial Ber­lin Con­fer­ence of 1884. The game-chang­ing weaponry of mod­ern war­fare be­came demo­cratic to the neme­sis of the Ber­lin Con­fer­ence pow­ers. Start­ing with the Chi­nese, Kore­ans, Viet­namese, Al­ge­ri­ans and fi­nally South­ern Africans — the gun and other weapons of mod­ern war­fare were un­leashed upon op­press­ing for­eign im­pe­rial pow­ers. That is how the in­ge­nious AK 47 ri­fle, timeously in­vented by Mikhail Ti­mofeye­vich Kalash­nikov in 1947, would end up so ubiq­ui­tous. The Sec­ond Chimurenga fed upon the finest tra­di­tions of the Marx­ist ide­o­log­i­cal out­look. This is not­with­stand­ing the cur­rent un­fash­ion­able fan­cies pum­melling the fail­ures of the Soviet Bloc na­tional ex­per­i­ments. I was in­ducted into the sec­ond in­take of the Chitepo School of Ide­ol­ogy. Among my group was Am­bas­sadors Thomas Mandig­ora and Mark Marongwe aka Com­rade Grey Ticha­tonga. That re­cruit­ment of wounded com­rades from the war-front as in­ductees was a first and spe­cial. As the war took root in­side the coun­try in 1975, the Zim­babwe African Na­tional Lib­er­a­tion Army (Zanla) sought to up­grade its game. Its po­lit­i­cal train­ing still un­der the rump of the ex-Zim­babwe Peo­ple’s Army (ZIPA) started to blend prac­ti­cal bat­tle­field ex­pe­ri­ence in po­lit­i­cal in­struc­tion and les­son re­search. Thus, we be­came among those maiden cadres of blend­ing the­ory with field prac­tice. This ide­o­log­i­cal thrust sur­vived the anti-in­tel­lec­tual streak that was the hall­mark of the as­cen­dant duo of Robert Mu­gabe and Solomon Mu­juru. This re­ac­tionary turn took fur­ther hold in the wake of the un­timely, if sus­pi­cious death, of Gen­eral Josiah Magama Ton­gog­ara in 1979 on the cusp of na­tional vic­tory. In four decades, the Zim babwe Rev­o­lu­tion has been tem­pered as it sur­vives tri­als and tribu­la­tions of ev­ery hue and stripe. This owes to the shared ide­o­log­i­cal for­ma­tion of ZANLA-ZIPRA. It is the build­ing plank of the Zim­babwe De­fence Forces as a mil­i­tary pride of resur­gent Africa. The ZDF goes fur­ther to earn ku­dos of global peer re­spect. I am al­ways grop­ing for a new ide­o­log­i­cal pur­pose to sus­tain the rad­i­cal tra­di­tion of the Samora Machel-Soweto ’76 Gen­er­a­tion. Their suc­cess­ful sac­ri­fices are the stuff of time­less leg­ends of the an­nals of hu­man de­vel­op­ment. Serendip­ity made me stum­ble upon Grae­ber. An old post-in­de­pen­dence 1980s Gov­ern­ment work­mate, Pa­tri­cia Kasiyamhuru, moved to academia in the 1990s at the Univer­sity of Zim­babwe. Con­cur­rently, I was forced to en­ter busi­ness by the va­garies of pol­i­tics. Para­dox­i­cally, my busi­ness stint be­came my re­turn av­enue to Gov­ern­ment in 2002. Mu­gabe was be­lea­guered by the West in neo-im­pe­rial and tren­chant re­sponse to the Fast-Track Land Re­form Pro­gramme. He drafted me back to pub­lic of­fice as Am­bas­sador to China. We needed al­ter­na­tive sources of cap­i­tal and mar­kets as Wash­ing­ton and Lon­don shut­tered our ac­cess doors. He turned to my skill-set that were now an amal­gam of busi­ness acu­men, aca­demic reach and im­pec­ca­ble rev­o­lu­tion­ary pedi­gree. Kasiyamhuru would later cot­ton to these cre­den­tials as she can­vassed for the Debt Ju­bilee Move­ment un­der the ban­ner of Zim­babwe Coali­tion on Debt and De­vel­op­ment (ZIMCODD). As of char­ac­ter, I delved into this com­plex and top­i­cal sub­ject. That is how I ended up with Grae­ber. There was added ex­cite­ment as I am an alma mater of a New York global money cen­tre univer­sity as well as nearby Bos­ton. I would wan­der into the labyrinth of Zim­babwe’s po­lit­i­cal econ­omy. I needed to un­der­stand how a gold pro­duc­ing na­tion of mil­len­nial his­tor­i­cal note ended up with­out a na­tional cur­rency. I waded into the in­duced cur­rency apartheid that denied the black African ma­jor­ity the means of mean­ing­ful ex­change. This was as se­rial graphic as it was racially egre­gious. As of 1956, only 25 Africans had a bank ac­count with added penury that it was a sav­ings one with an oner­ous 10 per­cent bur­den. Lo and be­hold, an African found in pos­ses­sion of a $100 hard cur­rency bill was li­able for trea­son charges. So much for the eggheads who now lament for the glory days of things Rhode­siana! It hit home how my grand­fa­ther, an early ur­ban­ite of Mbare, then Na­tional, would re­gale me with sto­ries of his bur­geon­ing ten­nis court busi­ness in the 1930s. Alas, the peas­ant would end with wist­ful lament of in­ten­tion­ally and di­a­bol­i­cally in­duced poverty in the post-World War II epoch. The nascent black petty mid­dle­class was mer­ci­lessly hounded out of op­por­tu­nity. Bri­tain was set­tling the com­mand­ing cream of its de­mo­bilised army of­fi­cers. They were on as­sign­ment to grow cash crops. On Lon­don’s doorstep were the Wash­ing­ton wartime lenders, they wanted their re­pay­ment for the Lend-Lease loans for money, ma­te­rial and ar­ma­ments ex­tended to de­feat Nazi Ger­many. The his­tory of debt, its in­her­i­tance and the use of mil­i­tary co­er­cion hit home with stark and painful re­al­ity. Rev­e­la­tion hit my eyes. The en­demic re­course to al­lo­ca­tion in hard cur­rency man­age­ment and how it in­evitably cor­rupted, how mo­nop­o­lies spawned, en­twined them­selves to gang­ster­ism and at­tempts at “state cap­ture”. There was the peren­nial sub­ver­sion of the stock ex­change by a dom­i­nant post-colo­nial cor­po­rate player. The post-in­de­pen­dent black African com­pradors lost no time to join the ra­pa­cious gravy train of klep­to­cratic greed. Un­reg­u­lated mobile money plat­forms ar­ro­gated them­selves the role of print­ing money. The Cen­tral Bank was rel­e­gated to the role of a com­pro­mised ac­com­plice serv­ing the usurper. This would pro­voke the wrath of the Sec­ond Repub­lic. Luck­ily the rev­o­lu­tion had his­tor­i­cal re­course. First, there was a will­ing and ready na­tional leader. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa in­voked game-chang­ing Statu­tory In­stru­ments. Not at all sur­pris­ing from a yes­ter­year young man who was a pi­o­neer re­cruit to the fledg­ling na­tional lib­er­a­tion army. Sec­ond, was ZANU PF, the party of the rev­o­lu­tion. It marched to vic­tory on the back of thou­sands of pa­tri­ots pay­ing the ul­ti­mate price for free­dom. Fi­nally, there was a strong State birthed and tem­pered by a bit­ter war of free­dom. For the first time ever, an African army waged and won a mod­ern war against the white set­tler sur­ro­gates of the fore­most im­pe­rial army of the era. Read­ing “Debt: The First Thou­sand Years” puts ev­ery­thing into na­tional per­spec­tive. In­ci­den­tally, a fel­low Zim­bab­wean aca­demic and so­cial ac­tivist, Charles Mud­ede, aptly and suc­cinctly cap­tures my em­pa­thy for Grae­ber. Writ­ing in the “The Stranger”, he opines: “Grae­ber’s book has forced me to com­pletely re-eval­u­ate my po­si­tion on hu­man eco­nom­ics, its his­tory, and its branches of thought. A Marx­ism with­out Grae­ber’s an­thro­pol­ogy is be­gin­ning to feel mean­ing­less to me.” Go well Grae­ber. Hu­man­ity shall make use of the tools of hu­man progress ren­dered through your prodi­gious and ground-break­ing in­tel­lect. The quest for Utopia ac­quires a tan­gi­ble feel and touch.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200524,Let’s clean our dirty stables!,"WHERE Bishop Lazi comes from, for ex­am­ple, you can­not ven­ture deep into the for­est to for­age for pro­vi­sions — fruits, an­i­mals, wood, etcetera — with­out re­spect­ing the nat­u­ral forces that in­her­ently lie therein. Re­spect is key to un­lock­ing se­crets of a much deeper and com­plex world. Not sur­pris­ingly, ru­ral folk know, as they have al­ways known, that you sim­ply take what you need and want in the for­est and noth­ing more. Greed goes un­re­warded. You do not care­lessly swing your axe on any and ev­ery tree for the fun of it. Reck­less­ness and cal­lous­ness is for­bid­den. And most im­por­tantly, you do not use dis­parag­ing pre­fixes to de­scribe any­thing that you see in the for­est. A loose tongue is cursed. In­deed the Bishop knows many who were “pun­ished” for this trans­gres­sion by be­ing tranced and made to aim­lessly won­der, zom­bie-like, in the maze of the for­est only to snap out of it after cir­cling hours on end even on well-known and well-trav­elled paths. They call it chadz­imira (sleep­walk­ing). Also, where Bishop Lazarus comes from, it was for­bid­den to bath in the Save River with scented soap. When­ever some­one dis­re­garded this ad­vice, the soap some­how man­aged to slither into the murky wa­ter, never to be re­cov­ered. Not so much for the in­fa­mous, unas­sum­ing and aus­tere green bar soap. You would make end­less trips with it to the river and lather it out un­til it slimmed into noth­ing­ness. Kikikiki. To this day, it is not known whether these crea­tures of the deep — if at all they ex­isted — sim­ply con­fis­cated the scented soap for keepsake, or they wanted to get rid of it. The same ap­plied to the vil­lage “Sab­bath”, which was ob­served on dif­fer­ent days in dif­fer­ent ar­eas. Aargh, well, maybe this was sim­ply mass vil­lage hys­te­ria. But, this not­with­stand­ing, rules and reg­u­la­tions are con­sid­ered sacro­sanct in the vil­lage, and this is why ru­ral ar­eas have re­mained rel­a­tively pris­tine com­pared to pre­dom­i­nantly per­verted ur­ban ar­eas. Nowhere does hu­man­ity live within the honourable and no­ble rules or­dained by man and by God than in ru­ral ar­eas. Rules and reg­u­la­tions, there­fore, pro­vide the en­ergy that sus­tains and bal­ances all the life forces around us. They can eas­ily de­fine suc­cess or fail­ure; luck or mis­for­tune. Also, ob­ser­vance and en­force­ment of rules and reg­u­la­tions can only be ab­so­lute; it does not se­lec­tively ap­ply to “for­mal” or “in­for­mal” spheres of life. Co-habit­ing with Covid-19 The world fool­ishly thought that the coro­n­avirus would blow over and life would re­sume as it was be­fore, but it is now 146 days — or four months and 25 days — since the disease was first iden­ti­fied in Wuhan, China, and it is still rag­ing. While re­duc­ing so­cial in­ter­course by clos­ing down so­cial spa­ces, in­clud­ing busi­nesses, through lock­downs has proved to be the gold stan­dard of deal­ing with the pan­demic, this can­not pos­si­bly be sus­tained in­ter­minably. Both the eco­nomic and psy­cho­log­i­cal toll can be stag­ger­ing to a point where the pre­scribed cure would seem­ingly be­come worse than the dam­age wrought by the disease it­self. On this one, the Bishop strangely agrees with Mr Don­ald Trump: the cure can­not be worse than the disease. So so­ci­eties, not least our own, are var­i­ously adopt­ing meth­ods of co-habit­ing with the virus, at least for now, by grad­u­ally open­ing up so­cial spa­ces and cau­tiously re­open­ing busi­nesses in or­der to en­sure that eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties — which are the lifeblood of com­mu­ni­ties — can re­sume. This, how­ever, can only be lim­ited to reg­u­lated en­vi­ron­ments, where guide­lines on so­cial dis­tanc­ing, screen­ing and hand sani­tis­ing can be ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively en­forced. In our very own teapot-shaped Repub­lic, most busi­nesses and com­mu­ni­ties en­dured more than 48 days (from March 30 to May 17) on lock­down, be­fore the re­stric­tions were re­laxed. They have since guard­edly re­sumed op­er­a­tions. But not so for the “in­for­mal sec­tor”. A long win­ter Well, in our con­text it means more than four mil­lion peo­ple are cir­cum­stan­tially “fur­loughed” and in­ac­tive. Zim­babwe’s bur­geon­ing “in­for­mal sec­tor” — which cap­tures an odd di­chotomy rang­ing from wheeler-deal­ers, ven­dors of all sorts, pi­rate taxis, con artists and hustlers of ev­ery shape and hue — is ranked by some ex­perts at the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) as the sixth largest on the con­ti­nent. Over the years, var­i­ous eco­nomic ex­perts es­ti­mate that be­tween US$3 bil­lion and US$7 bil­lion is cir­cu­lat­ing in the in­for­mal econ­omy. So, do not be­lieve that crap that be­tween 80 per­cent and 90 per­cent are un­em­ployed. When he was launch­ing the Poverty In­come Con­sump­tion and Ex­pen­di­ture Sur­vey 2011/12 on June 6 2013 as the then-Finance Min­is­ter, Tendai Biti, who still delu­sion­ally re­gards him­self as the best lo­cal eco­nomic brains ever, told us that only 9 per­cent of our coun­try­men were not eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive. Con­versely, this meant, or means, 91 per­cent are eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive. “We have al­ways had this ar­gu­ment about what is the per­cent­age of peo­ple that are em­ployed or un­em­ployed in Zim­babwe. Text­book econ­o­mists will say 85 per­cent, but that is not true. If we had a pop­u­la­tion like that most peo­ple in Zim­babwe would have died. It is not pos­si­ble . . . “One is ei­ther a farmer, sell­ing juice cards, driv­ing an emer­gency taxi or you are work­ing as a hairdresser. The fact of the mat­ter is most peo­ple are eco­nom­i­cally ac­tive,” said Biti. Some peo­ple un­sur­pris­ingly felt be­trayed — vi­o­lated even — by his ob­ser­va­tion, as this statis­tic had of­ten been po­lit­i­cally weaponised to re­li­giously and rou­tinely at­tack the Gov­ern­ment. What a mess! For Bishop Lazi, there can never be an “in­for­mal sec­tor”. It does not ex­ist. Nay, it must not be al­lowed to ex­ist. There can only be small and medium-sized en­ter­prises. Us­ing the term “in­for­mal sec­tor” to de­scribe eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties that ex­ist with­out the pre­cepts of the law or by-laws is sani­tis­ing the in­sane and nor­mal­is­ing the ab­nor­mal. And most of this non­sense and mess is hap­pen­ing within the precincts of thor­oughly in­com­pe­tent and clue­less lo­cal author­i­ties. Back in the day, you could not even ride your bi­cy­cle with­out a li­cence disc for it. You also needed a hawk­ers li­cence to vend all man­ner of wares, in­clud­ing veg­eta­bles and toma­toes. Hell, you could not even own a dog with­out hav­ing a li­cence-badge al­lot­ted to it. Although levies for li­cences were nom­i­nal, they cu­mu­la­tively re­sulted in help­ful rev­enues for lo­cal author­i­ties; and most im­por­tantly, they helped cre­ate a use­ful data­base that could be handy in reg­u­lat­ing even mi­cro eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties. Why can we not have our own ver­sion of “yel­low taxis” as in Amer­ica or “green taxis” as in Nige­ria rather than tol­er­at­ing “mushika-shika”, which are just a rene­gade ver­sion of the same? Why can we not have prop­erly des­ig­nated and reg­u­lated mar­ket stalls for ven­dors than hav­ing them use de­crepit bus ter­mini as shop-win­dows for their wares? This is in­sane! Do not be fooled, coun­cils have the full range of pol­icy in­stru­ments in their tool­kits to en­force this. They range from hawk­ers and street ven­dors by-laws, cy­cle-li­cens­ing by-laws, and dog li­cens­ing by-laws, among many oth­ers. These by-laws, which are the build­ing blocks of modern so­ci­eties, are still ex­tant. Pay­ing dues Yes, man was not made for the law, but the law was made for man. It is high time we re­li­giously sub­scribe and en­force these earthly or­gan­i­sa­tional and civil­i­sa­tional pre­cepts. Even the Lord in Matthew 22:17-21 coun­sels us: “Tell us then, what is your opin­ion? Is it right to pay the im­pe­rial taxes to Cae­sar or not? “But Je­sus, know­ing their evil in­tent, said, ‘You hyp­ocrites, why are you try­ing to trap me? Show me the coin used for pay­ing the tax.’ “They brought him a denar­ius, and he asked them, ‘Whose im­age is this? And whose in­scrip­tion?’ “‘Cae­sar’s,’ they replied. “Then he said to them, ‘ So give back to Cae­sar what is Cae­sar’s, and to God what is God’s’.” How­ever, two for­mer City of Harare May­ors — Muchadeyi Ma­sunda and Bernard Manyenyeni — told us that the peo­ple run­ning some of our lo­cal author­i­ties are ei­ther func­tion­ally il­lit­er­ate or ab­jectly in­com­pe­tent, or both. Kikikiki. But some­thing has got to give. Had some of our hawk­ers, street ven­dors, pi­rate taxis been for­mally regis­tered and reg­u­lated, chances are they could have been al­lowed to re­open within the reg­u­lated and pre­scribed guide­lines like any other busi­ness. They would also have re­ceived a help­ing hand from the $600 mil­lion kitty that has been set aside to in­su­late those that have been af­fected by the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing the re­sul­tant lock­down to fight it. The coro­n­avirus has again re­minded us about the pit­falls and pre­ten­sions of ac­cept­ing in­for­mal busi­nesses as presently in­ef­fi­ciently con­fig­ured. But, the virus has given us a blank slate from which to start from and re­set our fac­tory set­tings. Cen­tral Gov­ern­ment has moved with haste to use the lock­down to re­set some sec­tors of the econ­omy, it is high time lo­cal author­i­ties be­come nim­ble-footed in clean­ing up the mess in their back­yards.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20161211,2017 Na­tional Budget: A cri­tique,"ZIM­BABWE’S econ­omy is un­healthily bal­anced. The 2017 Na­tional Budget an­nounced last week is in­struc­tive. The coun­try’s con­sump­tion and im­port lev­els con­tinue to out­weigh pro­duc­tion and ex­ports. This un­bal­anced state of the econ­omy re­mains a ma­jor draw­back to eco­nomic re­cov­ery. The re­sul­tant budget and trade deficits are weigh­ing down the econ­omy. It is there­fore no surprise that the econ­omy has been slow­ing down since the last quar­ter of 2012, mak­ing eco­nomic re­bal­anc­ing ur­gent, be­fore the econ­omy sinks into a deeper cri­sis. Like China, Zim­babwe should adopt an in­vest­ment and ex­port led growth model. Though this may not be a one-siz­e­fit-all model, there is a lot of benefit that the coun­try can de­rive from the pre­scribed model. In­vest­ment and ex­port led growth model China’s growth mir­a­cle — China emerged from nowhere to be­come an eco­nomic su­per power af­ter im­ple­ment­ing an in­vest­ment and ex­port led growth model. An in­vest­ment and ex­port ori­ented growth model also en­tailed ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion of con­sump­tion and im­ports. This new growth model was an­chored by struc­tural and in­sti­tu­tional re­forms largely typ­i­fied by zero tol­er­ance on graft. By 2013, af­ter 35 years of eco­nomic re­forms, China has lifted about 350 mil­lion peo­ple from poverty. It is now the sec­ond largest econ­omy in the world and at one mo­ment it was thought China would over­take Amer­ica as the largest econ­omy of the world. Eco­nomic growth in China was largely at­trib­uted to the ef­fects of capital ac­cu­mu­la­tion, which was sus­tained by in­creased labour, pro­duc­tiv­ity and in­sti­tu­tional and struc­tural re­forms. The state of Zim­babwe’s econ­omy The econ­omy has been fal­ter­ing since the last quar­ter of 2012 on ac­count of both global and lo­cal in­flu­ences. The econ­omy is ex­pected to slow down for the fourth con­sec­u­tive year with a growth of 0,6 per­cent pro­jected in 2016. Eco­nomic slow­down comes on the back­drop of low do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion across var­i­ous sec­tors mainly agri­cul­ture, mining, man­u­fac­tur­ing, tourism and construction. Even the mod­er­ate growth of 1,7 per­cent pro­jected in 2017 is largely de­pen­dent on agri­cul­ture’s per­for­mance, which it­self is un­der threat from the La-Nina ef­fect. Key sec­tors of the econ­omy con­tinue to un­der-per­form on ac­count of both ex­ter­nal and lo­cal fac­tors. The agricul- ture sec­tor is ex­pected to de­cline by 3,7 per­cent this year, as drought takes a heavy toll for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year. Even the pro­jected 12 per­cent in­crease in 2017 is largely de­pen­dent on the ef­fects of La-Nina. The pro­jected growth of 1,7 per­cent in 2017 will be an­chored on im­proved per­for­mances in the mining, man­u­fac­tur­ing and tourism sec­tors. How­ever the per­for­mance of these sec­tors is not good enough to re­store the eco­nomic vi­tal­ity needed to­day. The poor per­for­mance of the agri­cul­ture sec­tor is ex­pected to weigh down the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor’s per­for­mance due to the in­ter­link­ages be­tween the two. This, cou­pled with chal­lenges re­lat­ing to an­ti­quated equip­ment, lack of capital, low ag­gre­gate de­mand, liq­uid­ity con­straints, high cost of util­i­ties and lack of com­pet­i­tive­ness, will re­sult in a mod­est growth of 0,3 per­cent in 2017. Mea­sures to im­prove the coun­try’s brand as a com­pet­i­tive tourism des­ti­na­tion will sup­port the pro­jected growth of 0,8 per­cent in the tourism sec­tor. The mining sec­tor con­tin­ues to suc­cumb to the va­garies of the devel­op­ments in the global econ­omy which threaten the es­ti­mated over­all growth of 6,9 per­cent. Do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion is a key chal­lenge As demon­strated by the sec­toral anal­y­sis above, Zim­babwe’s ma­jor prob­lem is that of low do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion. The coun­try has gone through mas­sive de-in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion that has rav­aged the man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try, mak­ing it very un­com­pet­i­tive. There is ur­gent need to rein­dus­tri­alise the coun­try. Quite clearly, re- in­dus­tri­al­is­ing Zim­babwe re­quires huge capital in­flows. Neg­a­tive do­mes­tic sav­ings of 11 per­cent im­ply a huge sav­ings in­vest­ment gap which can only be filled by for­eign capital mainly FDI. Sadly, for­eign capital con­tin­ues to un­der-per­form due to dis­cour­ag­ing poli­cies and ease of do­ing business fac­tors in Zim­babwe. A de­cline in for­eign capital in­flows to US$692 mil­lion is pro­jected in 2016, against US$1,2bil­lion in 2015. This, to­gether with the dis­sav­ing cul­ture in the coun­try, has seen a de­cline in the gross fixed capital for­ma­tion by 8 per­cent in the year. There is def­i­nitely need to in­crease the flow of capital into Zim­babwe so as to kick start in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion. The in­fras­truc­ture deficit of be­tween US$14 bil­lion to US$20 bil­lion, cou­pled with an es­ti­mated US$5 bil­lion re­quired to re­cap­i­talise the in­dus­try, is telling. As high­lighted be­fore, capital was a ma­jor driver of China’s eco­nomic growth when it started to im­ple­ment eco­nomic re­forms in 1978. Thus there may be need for rad­i­cal pol­icy changes and ex­pe­dit­ing the ease of do­ing business re­forms to at­tract more for­eign capital. Zim­babwe re­mains a con­sump­tive econ­omy Low pro­duc­tion lev­els largely re­flect bud­getary con­straints which limit in­vest­ment in pro­duc­tive goods. For the 10 months to October 30, 2016, em­ploy­ment costs con­sumed 91 per­cent of the to­tal revenue col­lec­tion of US$2,98 bil­lion, leav­ing only 9 per­cent (US$260mil­lion) for all other cur­rent and capital ex­penses. Sadly, the pro­vi­sion for em­ploy­ment costs re­mains high at US$3bil­lion in 2017, which leaves out only US$520 mil­lion (14 per­cent of to­tal rev­enues) for capital devel­op­ment pro­grammes. This is de­spite the fact that the Pub­lic Ser­vice wage bill ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion mea­sures are ex­pected to re­sult in some sav­ings of US$140 mil­lion in the out­look pe­riod. The sit­u­a­tion is com­pounded by the fact that paras­tatals and other pub­lic en­ter­prises con­tinue to milk the fis­cus, mainly through their in­ef­fi­cien­cies. Most of the pub­lic en­ter­prises are re­port­edly fail­ing to ser­vice their debts re­sult­ing in Gov­ern­ment guar­an­tees be­ing called up. As at October 31, 2016, called up guar­an­tees rep­re­sented 15,8 per­cent of the to­tal ex­ter­nal debt stock. There is def­i­nitely a strong case to pri­va­tise some of the pub­lic en­ter­prises. How­ever, lit­tle pre­cious ac­tion hap­pened on the ground de­spite Gov­ern­ment re­it­er­a­tions. Unhealthy budget and trade deficits weigh down the econ­omy The un­bal­anced state of the econ­omy has re­sulted in high lev­els of budget and trade deficit, whose con­trac­tionary ef­fects have largely weighed down eco­nomic growth. The coun­try’s budget deficit is ex­pected to top US$1,8 bil­lion on ac­count of un­der-per­for­mance in revenue and high lev­els of con­sump­tion, es­pe­cially by Gov­ern­ment. The re­sul­tant fi­nanc­ing gap of US$1,8 bil­lion is nearly half of the budget. This fi­nanc­ing gap is ex­pected to re­main in 2017 at US$400 mil­lion al­beit that it is a de­crease from the 2016 level. High budget deficits nat­u­rally spill over into high lev­els of im­ports given the con­straints in the pro­duc­tive sec­tors. The coun­try’s im­port bill re­mains un­sus­tain­able at US$5,35 bil­lion The in­crease in im­ports was ex­pe­ri­enced against a down­turn in the over­all ex­port per­for­mance. Ex­ports are ex­pected to fall by 6,9 per­cent to al­most US$3,4 bil­lion in 2016. This is ex­pected to re­sult in a trade deficit of about US$2 bil­lion. Clearly, the budget deficit and trade deficit char­ac­ter­is­ing the econ­omy needs to be funded from some­where. It’s wor­ry­ing the sources of fund­ing for the two deficits have largely been debt, cre­at­ing sources which are un­suit­able given the fact that the coun­try is al­ready over bor­rowed. Fund­ing the deficits and re­sul­tant debt The pe­riod un­der re­view has seen in­creased re­course to do­mes­tic fi­nan­cial sys­tem to fi­nance the budget deficit. The con­comi­tant crowd­ing out ef­fect is a draw­back to pri­vate sec­tor growth. The un­sus­tain­able debt lev­els in Zim­babwe largely re­flect the im­pact of high budget and trade deficits. As at October 31, 2016, Zim­babwe’s pub­lic debt stood at US$11,2 bil­lion or 79 per­cent of GDP. Of this debt, US$7,5 bil­lion or 53 per­cent of GDP was ex­ter­nal debt. Of the ex­ter­nal debt, US$5,2 bil­lion is in ar­rears, and this has re­sulted in the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of re­la­tion­ships with ma­jor cred­i­tors, thereby in­hibit­ing ac­cess to fi­nance. While the coun­try is pri­ori­tis­ing ar­rears clear­ance to in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, it is im­por­tant to note that the reliance on debt is an un­vi­able growth path in Zim­babwe to­day. Iron­i­cally even the RBZ con­tin­ues to bor­row to fi­nance some mon­e­tary projects. It is es­ti­mated that RBZ’s debt is now around US$400 mil­lion and there seems to be more ap­petite to bor­row from that in­sti­tu­tion. There is def­i­nitely need to in­crease the flow of capital into Zim­babwe so as to kick start in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion. The in­fras­truc­ture deficit of be­tween US$14 bil­lion to US$20 bil­lion, cou­pled with an es­ti­mated US$5 bil­lion re­quired to re­cap­i­talise the in­dus­try, is telling. Pre­scrib­ing so­lu­tions to Zim’s eco­nomic chal­lenges There is need to re­bal­ance the econ­omy to­wards more pro­duc­tion and ex­ports. This en­tails re­duc­tion in con­sump­tion and ex­ports. Un­lock­ing the growth po­ten­tial of Zim­babwe re­quires in­jec­tion of capital. Given the do­mes­tic capital con­straints oc­ca­sioned by the high dis­sav­ing rate and bud­gets there is need for poli­cies that at­tract for­eign capital mainly FDI. Gov­ern­ment may have to con­sider some rad­i­cal mea­sures to at­tract and re­tain the re­quired capital. The need for the ease of do­ing business re­forms and in­sti­tu­tional and struc­tural re­forms can­not be overem­pha­sised. Clearly, the road ahead is painful and re­quires sac­ri­fice.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20181029,‘We were never meant to strug­gle’,"IN AN ex­clu­sive in­ter­view, Crys­tal Order­son, for al­lAfrica, sat down with Samia Nkrumah — Ghana­ian ac­tivist and daugh­ter of the coun­try’s first pres­i­dent, Dr Kwame Nkrumah — to talk about the new scram­ble for Africa, and how many coun­tries are again knock­ing on the door of the pre­scrip­tive In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. One can get star-struck when con­vers­ing with Samia Yaba Nkrumah. Her pas­sion for Pan-African­ism and the de­vel­op­ment of the con­ti­nent to en­sure equal­ity for all Africans is palat­able. In 2011, Samia Nkrumah was elected to lead the Convention Peo­ple’s Party — the first woman to lead a po­lit­i­cal party. She has since re­tired from ac­tive pol­i­tics as an MP, but is now head­ing the Kwame Nkrumah Pan-African Cen­tre. Democ­racy Un­der Fire? Pres­i­dent Nkrumah fa­mously said: “We face nei­ther East nor West: we face for­ward; We pre­fer self-gov­ern­ment with dan­ger to servi­tude in tran­quil­lity.” And it’s this ethos for a bet­ter con­ti­nent that Nkrumah wants to fo­cus on, as she out­lined her think­ing at the Di­a­logue of Civil­i­sa­tion con­fer­ence on the Greek Is­land of Rhodes. “We are prac­tis­ing democ­racy in par­tic­u­lar en­vi­ron­ments and mil­lions of peo­ple’s needs are not be­ing met. We call elec­tions sea­son in Ghana ‘co­coa sea­son’ — it’s the time peo­ple make money!” Nkrumah said dur­ing her talk ti­tled “Eco­nomic In­equal­ity and Democ­racy: Are They Com­pat­i­ble?” Nkrumah said she wants democ­racy to trans­late into “tan­gi­ble” things: “I want it to erad­i­cate poverty, more san­i­ta­tion, ad­e­quate wa­ter for all, re­li­able power sup­ply. We are think­ing of the out­come of democ­racy and not just the right to ex­er­cise the right to vote.” The come­back kid: IMF back in Africa? Nkrumah is scathing about her cri­tique on the IMF struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grammes of the 1980s that left coun­tries cut­ting back on ed­u­ca­tion, health and in­fra­struc­ture projects. “They re­ally set us back, they truly set us back, these pre­scrip­tions im­posed on us from the out­side with­out true knowl­edge of what was hap­pen­ing on the ground and the fig­ures show it did not work,” says Nkrumah. Dur­ing the eight­ies and nineties’ debt cri­sis many African coun­tries turned to the IMF and the World Bank for fi­nan­cial bailouts and this came with strict con­di­tions. She says these loans did not help the growth of African economies “at all”. “It was never in­clu­sive growth and it did not trickle down and it af­fected our in­vest­ment in health and ed­u­ca­tion.” Since the 80s, some states have be­come more in­debted and the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis cou­pled with the col­lapse of com­modi­ties did not help the con­ti­nent. It is es­ti­mated that about 24 out of 50 low-in­come coun­tries are cur­rently in debt and that num­ber has dou­bled in the past five years. “Coun­tries are go­ing back to the IMF and truth be told we never ever stopped. It is so dif­fi­cult to ser­vice the debt and our small economies and credit rat­ing is so down and it is more ex­pen­sive for us to bor­row.” Nkrumah says it’s a vi­cious cycle that has to stop some­where — “sooner or later peo­ple will be so fed up and ex­plode”. In 2014, 15 African coun­tries had IMF loans worth a to­tal of $5,39 bil­lion. And now in 2018, it’s 20 coun­tries with loans to­talling $15,4 bil­lion. Coun­tries like An­gola, Mozam­bique and the Repub­lic of the Congo con­tinue knock­ing at the in­ter­na­tional lenders’ door. Nkrumah says Africa and Africans must have the free­dom to choose the poli­cies that suit their par­tic­u­lar con­text so that the con­ti­nent has more con­trol over its economies. Scram­ble for Africa? “There has al­ways been a scram­ble be­cause the po­ten­tial here is so huge, mean­ing we have not ex­plored what we have and we can­not give our re­sources away for any­thing. And judg­ing by the sta­tis­tics, China is the new sugar daddy for African states, but some say it comes at a price, per­haps not as pre­scrip­tive as the IMF and Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions, but nev­er­the­less has strings at­tached,” she said. Ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics, the Chi­nese in­ter­est-bear­ing loans rose from al­most zero in 2000 to $18 bil­lion in 2013 and then $30 bil­lion in 2016. This is part of the bil­lions of dol­lars in over­all fi­nan­cial sup­port to Africa. Nkrumah says if Africa speaks with one voice it can be more pow­er­ful in ne­go­ti­at­ing loans and deal with, for in­stance, China. “All this can­not hap­pen if we are weak states, there is no way you can ne­go­ti­ate favourable things for your peo­ple. We ad­vo­cat­ing for States work­ing to­gether to get the best deals for the peo­ple, the best way to reg­u­late the scram­ble.” Nkrumah says this is a con­ti­nent where ev­ery­one is com­ing for the re­sources, and she be­lieves if things are not fair sooner or later ten­sion will grow within pop­u­la­tions and coun­tries. “Sixty per­cent of arable land is here in Africa and that is where ev­ery­one is com­ing and is go­ing to come, and it has to be well-man­aged,” she says. Some might say Nkrumah might be naive in her re­sponse to the burn­ing is­sues some states are fac­ing, but she be­lieves, like her fa­ther, that unity for Africa is es­sen­tial. “Our unity is a great con­trib­u­tor to peace and Africans need to take charge — A new Africa has to be born.” Nkrumah says there will al­ways be prob­lems if Africans do not have unity of pur­pose and it can be fa­cil­i­tated by po­lit­i­cal union. “We need to visit the orig­i­nal idea. We were never meant to strug­gle; African states must work to­gether — it will be bet­ter for the world.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180615,FDI: A breath of fresh air for the job mar­ket,"ZIM­BAB­WEANS are look­ing for jobs so they can en­joy a bet­ter qual­ity of life. Their hope has been rekin­dled by the new dis­pen­sa­tion that is op­er­at­ing in over­drive to en­sure the econ­omy be­gins to func­tion nor­mally again. Decades of un­der-per­for­mance have drowned em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties as eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity al­most ground to a halt. There­fore, jobs have been long in com­ing but such projects as the $30 mil­lion Pepsi plant launched on Wednesday are sweet mu­sic to the ears of the many that have been wait­ing for years, if not decades to be gain­fully em­ployed. At least 600 peo­ple have al­ready been em­ployed at the Varun Bev­er­ages Plant while its chair­man, Mr Ravi Jaipuria, yes­ter­day said their potato pro­ject would gen­er­ate an ad­di­tional 600 di­rect jobs to farmer fam­i­lies. This means many more in­di­rect jobs will be cre­ated through this pro­ject. This is ar­guably the whole essence of in­vest­ment. Cre­at­ing jobs for the peo­ple, gen­er­at­ing wealth and other sweet­en­ers that will con­trib­ute to the coun­try’s Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct. Thou­sands of peo­ple have been laid off over the past decade or so as firms suc­cumbed to eco­nomic chal­lenges and had to shut down or scale down oper­a­tions sig­nif­i­cantly. Thou­sands of grad­u­ates from uni­ver­si­ties and other ter­tiary col­leges have also found the go­ing tough in terms of se­cur­ing em­ploy­ment or re­sources to start in­come-gen­er­at­ing projects. Hence the de­mand for em­ploy­ment is quite high. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa was quite apt on Wednesday when he said the en­trance of more for­eign com­pa­nies is aimed an up­grad­ing peo­ple’s stan­dard of liv­ing and cre­at­ing a mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030. Cer­tainly the ma­jor­ity have had to make do with very lit­tle, with many liv­ing below the Poverty Da­tum Line but in­creased in­vest­ments by both for­eign and lo­cal com­pa­nies will bring a bet­ter qual­ity life for the peo­ple. So the more in­vest­ments we have the more jobs are cre­ated. And this looks like it is no longer just wish­ful think­ing. In­creased ac­tiv­ity has been noted in the econ­omy over the last few months. A Mau­ri­tian firm also in­tends to cre­ate about 4 000 jobs for skilled and non-skilled work­ers through a $5 bil­lion in­vest­ment in a coal-fired power plant and the con­struc­tion of a liq­uid pe­tro­leum plant in Binga. The joint ven­ture, Emalahleni En­ergy Proteas Ven­ture of Mau­ri­tius, will own 51 per­cent of the ven­ture while lo­cals will ac­count for the bal­ance. This week alone we had the Chi­nese del­e­ga­tion from the rich Zhe­jiang Prov­ince and an­other high-pow­ered del­e­ga­tion from the United Kingdom. The del­e­ga­tion, which has been scout­ing for in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties here, ex­pressed keen­ness to es­tab­lish more busi­nesses. Zhe­jiang is one of China’s rich­est prov­inces with a nom­i­nal GDP of $711 bil­lion. This rep­re­sents more than six per­cent of China’s to­tal GDP. On the other hand, the UK del­e­ga­tion also ex­pressed its ea­ger­ness to in­vest here. Its team com­prised high-rank­ing ex­ec­u­tives who would make swift de­ci­sions on new in­vest­ments. The econ­omy is re­plete with ex­am­ples of in­vest­ments at var­i­ous stages of fi­nal­i­sa­tion and im­ple­men­ta­tion. Lat­est statis­tics show that about $15 bil­lion worth of in­vest­ment com­mit­ments have been reg­is­tered since the be­gin­ning of the year. Lo­cal busi­nesses have also been re­tool­ing and ex­pand­ing oper­a­tions in some in­stances. Early this week Presi- dent Mnan­gagwa com­mis­sioned an $8 mil­lion corn-snack and milling out­fit -Davipel - which is also ex­pected to cre­ate hun­dreds of jobs. For­mer Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce pres­i­dent Mr David Norupiri is the en­tre­pre­neur be­hind this pro­ject. Fur­ther­more, the im­mi­nent re­sus­ci­ta­tion of the Zim­babwe Iron and Steel Com­pany (Zis­cos­teel) is also ex­pected to cre­ate hun­dreds of op­por­tu­ni­ties for for­mer em­ploy­ees and new re­cruits. All this means that job op­por­tu­ni­ties will be avail­able in their hun­dreds, ef­fec­tively trans­form­ing the lives of thou­sands of peo­ple and their de­pen­dants. Once these are con­cre­tised, the num­ber of jobs likely to be cre­ated is quite sig­nif­i­cant and will sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce the un­em­ploy­ment fig­ures. Many have been roam­ing the streets in search of jobs while oth­ers are en­gaged in in­for­mal ac­tiv­i­ties just to eke a liv­ing. Zim­bab­weans are en­tre­pre­neur­ial in nature and al­ways find their way round ad­verse sit­u­a­tions. This has helped pro­vide a soft land­ing for the job­less. Many grad­u­ates are do­ing jobs that they did not train for, a com­pro­mise ne­ces­si­tated by the scarcity of jobs. But a bright light is now shin­ing at the end of the tun­nel and that tun­nel is also get­ting shorter and shorter. Gov­ern­ment is pri­ori­tis­ing the econ­omy and ac­tiv­ity is pick­ing up. We are ex­cited that Gov­ern­ment has set up an in­vest­ment com­mit­tee to ex­pe­dite the ap­proval process. This should see the re­moval of the bu­reau­cracy that has taken months, and years, in some cases for projects to be ap­proved. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said the com­mit­tee will fa­cil­i­tate in­vest­ments while work­ing on es­tab­lish­ing the Zim­babwe In­vest­ment and Development Au­thor­ity (Zida), which will be an amal­ga­ma­tion of de­part­ments in­volved in fa­cil­i­tat­ing in­vest­ment. The in­terim com­mit­tee came into be­ing af­ter the re­al­i­sa­tion that the es­tab­lish­ment of ZIDA could take longer than an­tic­i­pated and yet the pro­cesses need to move ex­pe­di­tiously to im­prove Zim­babwe’s ease of do­ing busi­ness sta­tus. “We are fast track­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Zim­babwe In­vest­ment and Development Au­thor­ity as a one-stop in­vest­ment shop and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion cen­tre. I am glad to ad­vise that we have re­cently ap­proved the set­ting up of an in­terim in­vest­ment and trade fa­cil­i­ta­tion com­mit­tee that will of­fer speedy at­ten­tion to in­vest­ment is­sues,” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20181125,From a vi­cious to a vir­tu­ous cy­cle,"ABOUT a year ago, Pres­i­dent Em mer son Mnan­gagwa’s newly-minted Gov­ern­ment em­barked on the oner­ous task of lay­ing the foun­da­tion for es­tab­lish­ment of what we now com­monly re­fer to as the Se­cond Repub­lic. The rea­sons why the First Repub­lic ul­ti­mately im­ploded are clear. A stark dis­re­gard for eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals; the en­trench­ment of un­pro­duc­tive self-en­ti­tle­ment that it­self bred an un­wieldy, un­re­spon­sive and cor­rupt bu­reau­cracy; the emer­gence of a toxic po­lit­i­cal clique that acted with im­punity and cr ass ar­ro­gance; and a cul­ture of in­do­lence were among the most ap­par­ent viruses that felled the First Repub­lic. It was from th­ese ashes that Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has had to coax a phoenix. To as­sist him in that mis­sion. His Gov­ern­ment — in its very early days — asked the African De­vel­op­ment Bank to con­duct an eco­nomic study of Zim­babwe to ren­der ad­vice on how best to struc­ture the Se­cond Repub­lic’ s quest to es­tab­lish an up­per mid­dle-in­come econ­omy by 2030. The out­come of that re­quest is the com­pact but fe­cund re­port ti­tled“Build­ing a New Zim­babwe: Tar­geted poli­cies for growth and job cre­ation”, which Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa makes ref­er­ence to in this week’ s inst al ment of his col­umn in The Sun­day Mail. The lead au­thor, AfDB act­ing di­rec­tor( Coun­try Eco­nom­ics De­part­ment) Fer­di­nand Bako up, is quite op­ti­mistic about Zim­babwe’ s growth prospects. The coun­try’s main as­sets, the re­port notes, are a “gen­er­ous en­dow­ment of nat­u­ral re­sources, ex­ist­ing stock of pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture, and com­par­a­tive ly skilled labour force”. To un­lock the po­ten­tial in­her­ent in th­ese as­sets, the A fD B sug­gests a three-pronged short to medium-term strat­egy hinged on agri­cul­ture, eco-tourism and spe­cial eco­nomic zones. It sounds pretty sim­ple, be­cause it is. We have to start with the ba­sic sand build from therein sub­se­quent na­tional de­vel­op­ment plans. For the first “prong”, head­way has al­ready been made by way of Com­mand Agri­cul­ture, and it is sig­nif­i­cant that the 2019 Na­tional Bud­get pro­poses to al­lo­cate $989,3 mil­lion for in­puts, ir­ri­gation de­vel­op­ment, me chan is at ion and other re­lated ar­eas. Zim­babwe is on the right track in terms of agri­cul­tural out­put. The next phase of in­vest­ments hould­bei na gr o-pro­cess­ing and mar­kets de­vel­op­ment. It is some­thing that Ethiopia has learnt well, and some­thing we should learn. At the turn of the mil­len­nium, Ethiopia was clas­si­fied as the se­cond-poorest­the world, but the A fD B an­tic­i­pate sit will at­tain mid­dle-in­come sta­tus by 2025 on the back of agri­cul­ture-led in­dus­trial is at ion. That coun­try fo­cused on in­creased out­put and in­creased value ad­di­tion. Then they in­vested much fi­nan­cial and po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal in de­vel­op­ing East Asian, Mid­dle East­ern and Euro­pean Union mar­ket ac­cess. If Ethiopia did it, we can also“did it ”. We have seen that we can in­crease pro­duc­tion, so now we need to di­ver­sify that out­put, process it, and send it to mar­kets that will pay in for­eign cur­rency. On the se­cond“prong” of eco-tourism, we have not seen enough from Gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor in terms of de­vel­op­ing des­ti­na­tions, im­prov­ing ac­cess to them, and mar­ket­ing them to the world. Much of the de­vel­op­ment bur­den in this area lies in the hands of the pri­vate sec­tor. Gov­ern­ment’s im­por­tant role on this front is fa­cil­i­ta­tion and cre­ation of an en­vi­ron­ment­that al­lows pri­vate in­vest­ment to thrive in eco-tourism. In­no­va­tion must be al­lowed to thrive. In­no­va­tion must be en­cour­aged. Pub­lic-pri­vate and pri­vate-pri­vate part­ner­ships must be forged. Surely, it should not be that dif­fi­cult to mar­ket a des­ti­na­tion like Zim­babwe for eco-tourism, which is es­sen­tially tourism di­rected at the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment and its wildlife. But this must bed one in away that the money comes to Zim­babwe; not this busi­ness of tourists pay­ing for their en­tire pack­ages in Europe or North Amer­ica to Euro­pean or North Amer­i­can agents who have Euro­pean or North Amer­i­can bank ac­counts. On the third“prong ”, that of spe­cial eco­nomic zones, as with agri­cul­ture, Zim­bab­we­has made sig­nif­i­cant head way al­ready. SEZs have been des­ig­nated and more shall be des­ig­nated as the in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment im­proves. The 2019 Na­tional Bud­get does well to fa­cil­i­tate op­er­a­tional is at ion of the Zim­bab­weIn­vest­ment and De­vel­op­ment Agency. What Gov­ern­ment and the pri­vate sec­tor need to do is iden­tify pri­or­ity ar­eas in which Zim­babwe has com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage for lo­cal man­u­fac­tur­ing with an eye on ex­port mar­kets. The AfDB re­port notes that“Gov­ern­ment should pay at­ten­tion to spon­ta­neous self-dis­cov­ery by pri­vate en­ter­prises and sup­port the scal­ing up of suc­cess­ful pri­vate in­no­va­tion in new in­dus­tries”. It con­tin­ues: “Rapid tech­no­log­i­cal change may give rise to new op­por­tu­ni­ti­esthat would not have ex­isted a decade or two ear­lier in the rapidly grow­ing com­para­tor coun­tries. Ex­am­ples in­clude mo­bile phones and re­lated e-ser­vices, so­cial me­dia, and green tech­nolo­gies.” That is what SEZs should be all about. Zim­babwe is not go­ing to de­velop by be­ing a net ex­porter of un­pro­cessed agri­cul­tural or min­ing out­put, by re­ly­ing on in­di­vid­ual for­eign­ers to stum­ble upon us as an eco-tourism des­ti­na­tion, or by con­tin­u­ingto man­u­fac­ture the goods that have lim­ited in­ter­na­tional mar­ket ap­peal. We must iden­tify the ar­eas in agri­cul­ture,tourism and man­u­fac­tur­ing in which we have a com­par­a­tive ad­van­tage. In a cou­ple of decades, China lev­er­aged on its hu­man and nat­u­ral re­source bases and trans­formed into a vi­able eco­nomic con­cern. Again, if China did it, we can also “did it ”. By un­leash­ing our hu­man cap­i­tal and nat­u­ral re­sources, com­bin­ing those with hon­est, hard work, while en­gag­ing and re-en­gag­ing with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, Zim­babwe can break out of the vi­cious cy­cle of poverty and break into a vir­tu­ous cy­cle of strong, sus­tain­able and shared de­vel­op­ment.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150508,Re­solv­ing the coun­try’s debt cri­sis Part 2,"THE Lon­don terms were for­mu­lated in 1991 to pro­vide 50% debt ser­vice re­duc­tion as well as other en­hance­ments that could en­sure more even spread of debt ser­vice pay­ments. The Naples terms were adopted in De­cem­ber 1994 for the poor­est and most in­debted coun­tries. They pro­vided up to 67% debt re­lief on the present value (PV) of the debt. Dur­ing the pe­riod 1980 to 1986, not less than 22 African coun­tries ne­go­ti­ated debt reschedul­ing un­der the Paris and Lon­don Clubs. The large num­ber of reschedul­ing within th­ese few years and their fre­quency re­veal a se­ri­ous prob­lem of debt ser­vic­ing by many African coun­tries. African coun­tries have gone through nu­mer­ous reschedul­ing ar­range­ments but th­ese ini­tia­tives have failed to re­store debt sus­tain­abil­ity or re­verse the growth of debt stock. Reschedul­ing did not pro­vide debt bur­den re­lief, but merely post­poned debt ser­vice pay­ments while at the same time in­creased the debt bur­den by ap­ply­ing mar­ket-re­lated in­ter­est rates. The HIPC ini­tia­tive was in­tro­duced in 1996. Though the HIPC ini­tia­tive pro­vided to­tal debt can­cel­la­tion to some of the highly in­debted poor coun­tries it how­ever proved in­ad­e­quate to sus­tain­ably deal with Africa’s ex­ter­nal debt bur­den. There were also a num­ber of con­cerns in terms of the de­sign and im­ple­men­ta­tion of the HIPC ini­tia­tive. The el­i­gi­bil­ity for debt re­duc­tion was too closely linked to per­for­mance un­der the IMF/World Bank eco­nomic re­form pro­grammes that had pre­vi­ously failed. Im­por­tantly, very few coun­tries were viewed as suf­fi­ciently im­pov­er­ished or in­debted to qual­ify. Also the cri­te­ria for el­i­gi­bil­ity and debt sus­tain­abil­ity still re­quired poor coun­tries to di­vert scarce re­sources away from vi­tal hu­man needs and in­vest­ment in au­then­tic devel­op­ment. Lastly, the time-frame for re­ceiv­ing debt re­lief was deemed too long as coun­tries had to es­tab­lish a good track record for im­ple­ment­ing IMF re­forms for three years be­fore re­ceiv­ing bi­lat­eral debt re­lief from cred­i­tor gov­ern­ments. A num­ber of cri­tiques ar­gued that HIPC was aimed at strength­en­ing and le­git­imis­ing the dis­cred­ited struc­tural ad­just­ment poli­cies im­posed by the World Bank and the IMF. In 1999, an en­hanced ver­sion (HIPC II), was adopted mak­ing it eas­ier for coun­tries to meet the qual­i­fy­ing con­di­tions, in­clud­ing im­ple­ment­ing World Bank and IMF struc­tural ad­just­ment pro­grams. HIPC II was de­signed to pro­vide faster, deeper and broader debt re­lief and strengthen the link be­tween debt re­lief, poverty re­duc­tion and so­cial poli­cies. In or­der to deal with debt prob­lems of non-HIPC coun­tries, the Paris Club ap­proved in Oc­to­ber 2003 the Evian ap­proach. The Evian ap­proach was de­signed to im­prove Paris Club ca­pac­ity to deal ef­fi­ciently with the debt of nonHIPCs. Its aim was to take into ac­count debt sus­tain­abil­ity considerations; given that Paris Club stan­dard treat­ments have not been able to ad­dress debt sus­tain­abil­ity prob­lems and could lead to debtor coun­tries bear­ing, un­sus­tain­able debt into cy­cles of debt reschedul­ing. It is sup­posed to tai­lor Paris Club debt treat­ments to the fi­nan­cial needs of the debtor coun­tries over time and con­trib­ute to the ef­forts of re­solv­ing cri­sis more or­derly, timely and pre­dictably. The Mul­ti­lat­eral Debt Re­lief Ini­tia­tive (MDRI) was launched in June 2005 by the G8 to re­duce fur­ther the debt of HIPCs and pro­vide ad­di­tional re­sources to help them meet the Mil­len­nium Devel­op­ment Goals (MDGs). The MDRI is sep­a­rate from the HIPC ini­tia­tive but linked to it in terms of op­er­a­tion. Un­der the MDRI, the mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions - IMF, IDA and African Devel­op­ment Bank (AfDB) pro­vide 100 per­cent debt re­lief on el­i­gi­ble debts to coun­tries that have reached com­ple­tion point un­der the HIPC ini­tia­tive. HIPC ini­tia­tive and MDRI re­lief have sig­nif­i­cantly low­ered debt ra­tios in ben­e­fi­ciary coun­tries, but other eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals and cir­cum­stances re­main un­changed. IMF and IDA ac­knowl­edge that the HIPC’s project and debt man­age­ment ca­pac­i­ties re­main gen­er­ally weak. With­out a doubt, ef­forts pur­sued to find so­lu­tions to Africa’s in­debt­ed­ness are at best been in­ad­e­quate. Ar­rears clear­ance is a pre­req­ui­site for full en­gage­ment and abil­ity to bor­row from the In­ter­na­tional Fi­nan­cial In­sti­tu­tions (IFIs). Zim­babwe is cur­rently not HIPC el­i­gi­ble and as the list was closed in 2005 the process would have to be re­opened for Zim­babwe to be in­cluded. A clear legal frame­work and debt man­age­ment sys­tem cov­er­ing ex­ter­nal and do­mes­tic debt, man­age­ment of ex­ist­ing debt and new bor­row­ing, and all is­sues sur­round­ing con­tin­gent li­a­bil­i­ties should be de­vel­oped. The legal frame­work should clearly state who is able to con­tract new bor­row­ing on be­half of the state and for what pur­pose; eval­u­a­tion and due process re­quire­ments; ac­count­abil­ity and sanc­tions for fail­ure; in­volve­ment of par­lia­ment and civil so­ci­ety in over­sight func­tions. This is to en­sure ef­fec­tive and ef­fi­cient uti­liza­tion of present and fu­ture public re­sources so as to pre­vent waste and in­ef­fi­cien­cies. There is need for a Na­tional Debt Strat­egy, based on a tech­ni­cal debt sus­tain­abil­ity anal­y­sis, which is then val­i­dated through con­sul­ta­tion with civil so­ci­ety. For ef­fec­tive debt man­age­ment it is cru­cial to have a firm po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment and will to sound debt man­age­ment, es­pe­cially ad­her­ing to legal and ac­count­abil­ity frame­works. There is also a need for close co­or­di­na­tion among many gov­ern­ment agen­cies, to en­sure co­her­ence with over­all poli­cies for eco­nomic growth and poverty re­duc­tion, es­pe­cially in the anal­y­sis of whether debt is sus­tain­able and what new loans or debt should be con­tracted. There should also be par­tic­i­pa­tion of all key stake­hold­ers in­clud­ing civil so­ci­ety and ac­count­abil­ity as well. There should be ef­fec­tive con­sul­ta­tion of par­lia­ment and key stake­hold­ers on new bor­row­ing and public spend­ing. We there­fore ur­gently need in­de­pen­dent and strong in­sti­tu­tions that pro­mote so­cial dia­logue on key is­sues such as public debt. The gov­ern­ment should also un­der­take an au­dit (re­view) of each of the projects for which the debts and loans were in­curred. This would en­able the gov­ern­ment to truly ver­ify the gen­uine­ness or oth­er­wise of the debts and to see what per­cent­age of the debt is odi­ous. Granted, debt over­hang con­sti­tutes a ma­jor ob­sta­cle, it is only a symp­tom of the broader po­lit­i­cal, struc­tural and eco­nomic chal­lenges in­her­ent in the econ­omy. As a part and a symp­tom of the broader chal­lenges, th­ese broader is­sues must be fun­da­men­tally tack­led as part of a sus­tain­able debt strat­egy. For in­stance the lack of di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and com­pet­i­tive­ness of the econ­omy and the high coun­try/po­lit­i­cal risk are ma­jor con­straints to both sus­tain­able poverty re­duc­tion and debt strat­egy. With­out ad­dress­ing the risk and un­cer­tainty in­her­ent in the econ­omy, it is dif­fi­cult to stem cap­i­tal flight, and pre­vent fu­ture in­debt­ed­ness. Zim­babwe needs to learn from the East Asian coun­tries that adopted and im­ple­mented suc­cess­ful industrial poli­cies and ex­port-ori­ented strate­gies. Con­sump­tion im­ports that lead to in­debt­ed­ness should be dis­cour­aged and cur­tailed. In­stead the na­tion should im­port in­vest­ment goods that can be used in the pro­duc­tion sec­tor, par­tic­u­larly for adding value to pri­mary prod­ucts be­fore ex­por­ta­tion. This would con­trib­ute in re­vers­ing the un­favourable terms of trade. Fur­ther, it will not only in­crease GDP but also boost ex­ports which are nec­es­sary for debt re­pay­ments. Gov­ern­ment should vig­or­ously pur­sue sound eco­nomic pol­icy and po­lit­i­cal re­forms, not just as an at­tempt to meet the re­quire­ments of donors for debt re­duc­tion, but as a fun­da­men­tal na­tional im­per­a­tive. Such re­forms should ad­dress the poor state of in­fra­struc­ture, en­force the rule of law and min­i­mize the risks and un­cer­tain­ties as­so­ci­ated with the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment. Mea­sures are needed not just to re­duce debt per se, but most im­por­tantly to re­store sus­tain­able growth, al­le­vi­ate poverty, and even­tu­ally re­store the ca­pac- ity of the coun­try to pur­sue nor­mal­ized re­la­tion­ships with of­fi­cial and com­mer­cial cred­i­tors in a con­text of strength­ened coun­try cred­it­wor­thi­ness. A sta­ble po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment is very im­por­tant es­sen­tial for im­proved ex­port earn­ings and re­duced con­sump­tion im­ports which in turn trans­late into a trade sur­plus. In turn, the trade sur­plus would lead to a re­duc­tion in the cur­rent ac­count deficit and ul­ti­mately an im­prove­ment in the debt bur­den. More im­por­tantly while loans from the IFIs can be cru­cial how­ever no coun­try can sus­tain­ably de­velop on the ba­sis of IMF and World Bank loans. Devel­op­ment has to be in­ter­nally driven and auto cen­tric. The East Asian tigers, China, In­dia and Viet­nam demon­strate this tru­ism. What th­ese loans have done in most de­vel­op­ing coun­tries is to per­pet­u­ate the de­pen­dency syn­drome and fur­ther in­debt those coun­tries. We have a lot of re­sources that we could lever­age to cre­ate fis­cal space for devel­op­ment. All coun­tries that have de­vel­oped have taken re­spon­si­bil­ity for their ac­tions. Devel­op­ment is not a mir­a­cle. Devel­op­ment is in­ter­nally-in­duced and never ex­ter­nal. It has to be gen­er­ated from within and can­not be foisted from out­side. The Amer­i­cans or Chi­nese can­not de­velop you. What in­ter­est is it of theirs to do so? Ac­tu­ally what they do is to kick away the lad­der. Devel­op­ment is the nat­u­ral out­come of con­sis­tency in do­ing the right things over and over. Fo­cus, dis­ci­pline and de­ter­mi­na­tion are im­por­tant. As a na­tion we should also have a clearly de­fined and enun­ci­ated na­tional ver­sion.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160629,Global food in­dus­try blamed for 25% of green­house emis­sions,"THE global food in­dus­try is re­spon­si­ble for about 25 per­cent of the world’s green­house gas emis­sions, mak­ing it one of the big­gest driv­ers of cli­mate change, a study re­port by Ox­fam In­ter­na­tional has re­vealed. In the re­port, “Feed­ing Cli­mate Change” pub­lished on its of­fi­cial web­site Mon­day, Ox­fam says com­pa­nies cul­ti­vat­ing the five ma­jor food­stuffs — rice, soya beans, corn, wheat and palm oil — among oth­ers, need to make dras­tic emis­sions cuts. The re­port warns that mil­lions of small-scale farm­ers in the world, on whom the in­dus­try re­lies, are very vul­ner­a­ble to ex­treme weather pat­terns. Rice, soya beans, corn, wheat and palm oil to­gether lead to more green­house gas emis­sions than any coun­try’s in­di­vid­ual foot­print, apart from China and the United States, says the re­search study on the food in­dus­try and cli­mate change. Un­less dras­tic mea­sures are taken, the re­port warns that the Paris Agree­ment’s goals to reach “net-zero” emis­sions by the mid­dle of the cen­tury and limit global warm­ing to 1.5 de­grees Cel­sius will not be met. Re­leased ahead of the key busi­ness and cli­mate sum­mit that started yes­ter­day and ends to­day in London, the re­port iden­ti­fies emis­sions from farm soils as a ma­jor con­trib­u­tor to cli­mate change. “Meth­ane pro­duced by flooded rice pad­dies and ni­trous ox­ide from the use of fer­tilis­ers are some of the ‘su­per­pol­lu­tants’ pro­duced by farm soils. “To­gether, these soil emis­sions are as dam­ag­ing to the en­vi­ron­ment as those pro­duced by de­for­esta­tion to cre­ate new farm­land, which has rightly been the fo­cus of the in­dus­try’s cli­mate poli­cies in re­cent years,” says Ox­fam. Ox­fam In­ter­na­tional’s food and cli­mate pol­icy lead, Tim Gore is quoted in the re­port as say­ing: “The Paris Agree­ment was a big step for­ward, but we can’t meet its goals with­out fur­ther ur­gent ac­tion. “Busi­ness and in­dus­try lead­ers gath­er­ing in London this week must show that Paris is a spring­board for deeper emis­sions cuts and do more to help farm­ers on the front lines of cli­mate change. “The food and bev­er­age sec­tor should be lead­ing the way.” Ox­fam es­ti­mates that the 10 big­gest food and bev­er­age com­pa­nies in the world de­pend on at least 100 mil­lion of these small-scale farm­ers around the world. When cli­mate dis­as­ters strike, these farm­ers and their fam­i­lies are of­ten forced to sell off their pos­ses­sions, and are in dan­ger of fall­ing into poverty and hunger, it says. “The risks for women farm­ers are even higher, as they have un­equal ac­cess to land, credit, and other fi­nan­cial re­sources. Ad­di­tion­ally, they are of­ten ex­cluded from join­ing farm­ing co­op­er­a­tives and other sup­port sys­tems to help them keep work­ing when ex­treme weather ru­ins crops,” reads part of the re­port. Along­side the re­port, Ox­fam says it has launched an on­line tool that il­lus­trates the scale of green­house gases pro­duced by var­i­ous food com­modi­ties around the world. The tool also in­cludes first­hand ac­counts from small-scale farm­ers show­ing how cli­mate change af­fects them. Gore said: “Food com­pa­nies not only need to out­line sci­ence-based emis­sions cuts in their sup­ply chain and work with small-scale farm­ers to im­ple­ment them, but also help these farm­ers thrive in the face of the chang­ing cli­mate by guar­an­tee­ing them a liv­ing in­come. “Do­ing so would be good for peo­ple and good for busi­ness. If food com­pa­nies fail to act, it’ll be im­pos­si­ble to keep the prom­ises of the Paris Agree­ment.”",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160718,Un­pack­ing foiled mil­i­tary coup in Tur­key,"ACOUP at­tempt by a sec­tion of the Turk­ish of­fi­cer corps was crushed Satur­day by forces loyal to the gov­ern­ment headed by Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan. There was fight­ing be­tween ri­val mil­i­tary and po­lice units in both Is­tan­bul, the coun­try’s eco­nomic cen­tre, and Ankara, the po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal. As of this writ­ing, 265 peo­ple are re­ported to have been killed and many hun­dreds more wounded. Over 3 000 mil­i­tary per­son­nel have been ar­rested and thou­sands of judges have been sus­pended. The coup in­sti­ga­tors, who ap­pear to rep­re­sent a wing of the mil­i­tary and state ap­pa­ra­tus that has been sidelined by Er­do­gan and fears be­ing marginalised even fur­ther, de­clared in a state­ment that their ac­tions were seek­ing to “re­in­state con­sti­tu­tional or­der, hu­man rights and free­doms, the rule of law and the gen­eral se­cu­rity that was dam­aged.” Er­do­gan, who was on hol­i­day at an Aegean Sea re­sort, used a FaceTime video call to a live news broad­cast on CNN Tur­key to de­nounce the putsch and call for “peo­ple to gather in squares and air­ports” to de­fend his gov­ern­ment. A WSWS cor­re­spon­dent re­ported early Satur­day morn­ing that, in the work­ing class sub­urbs of Is­tan­bul, “thou­sands of peo­ple are in the streets” in op­po­si­tion to the coup and that he could hear jets in the air and gun­fire nearby. Near Ankara, Turk­ish Air Force F-16 jet fight­ers shot down a he­li­copter op­er­at­ing in sup­port of the at­tempted putsch. The Turk­ish par­lia­ment build­ing in Ankara was bombed by the rebels. The coup at­tempt was op­posed by a large sec­tion of the armed forces, the main Turk­ish busi­ness fed­er­a­tion, and, most sig­nif­i­cantly, by the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion, which is­sued a state­ment in Washington in sup­port of the Er­do­gan gov­ern­ment. Within hours of the launch­ing of the coup at­tempt, army units back­ing the putsch were with­draw­ing from the streets, while pro-gov­ern­ment forces had re­taken con­trol of the main state tele­vi­sion broad­caster, TRT. The un­fold­ing events are tes­ti­mony to the gen­er­alised break­down tak­ing place in­ter­na­tion­ally in the po­lit­i­cal in­sti­tu­tions and mech­a­nisms of bour­geois rule. Coun­try af­ter coun­try is de­scend­ing into tur­moil un­der the im­pact of the in­tractable global eco­nomic cri­sis, his­toric lev­els of so­cial in­equal­ity and the dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences of the mil­i­tary agenda of US im­pe­ri­al­ism and its al­lies to dom­i­nate the oil-rich Mid­dle East and un­der­mine Rus­sian and Chi­nese in­flu­ence in ev­ery part of the world. The failed coup in Tur­key takes place in the con­text of the fall­out from the “Leave” vote in the Brexit ref­er­en­dum in the United King­dom and a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis in the United States over po­lice killings and the pos­si­bil­ity of Don­ald Trump win­ning the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. It fol­lows the ex­ten­sion of emer­gency rule in France, an ac­cel­er­at­ing drive by NATO to­ward mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion with Rus­sia, and im­mense ten­sions in Asia af­ter an in­ter­na­tional court rul­ing that China’s ter­ri­to­rial claims in the South China Sea are in­valid. There is no ques­tion that the un­cer­tainty pro­duced by global in­sta­bil­ity plays a ma­jor role in what ap­pear to be reck­less, even des­per­ate ac­tions be­ing taken in rul­ing cir­cles around the world, in­clud­ing the cal­cu­la­tion by a fac­tion of the Turk­ish mil­i­tary that the only way to sta­bilise bour­geois rule in the coun­try was to over­throw Er­do­gan’s regime. Er­do­gan’s Is­lamist-based Jus­tice and De­vel­op­ment Party ( AKP) has held gov­ern­ment since 2002. It has presided over a mas­sive eco­nomic ex­pan­sion based on the dereg­u­la­tion and open­ing up of the coun­try and its labour force as a base for low­cost pro­duc­tion for transna­tional cor­po­ra­tions. The cap­i­tal­ist elite has en­riched it­self enor­mously, with the top 1 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion in­creas­ing its share of na­tional wealth from 39 per­cent in 2002 to 54 per­cent by 2015. The work­ing class and ru­ral poor, how­ever, have seen their liv­ing stan­dards dec­i­mated. Even of­fi­cial sta­tis­tics show that 22.4 per­cent of Turk­ish house­holds earn less than the poverty line of $1,626 a month. Un­em­ploy­ment stands at 10.8 per­cent, or some three mil­lion peo­ple, while another three mil­lion work­ers have left the coun­try to seek jobs in other ar­eas of Europe. Along­side the growth of so­cial con­tra­dic­tions, Tur­key has been pro­foundly desta­bilised by the col­lab­o­ra­tion of Er­do­gan and the AKP with the US in­va­sion and oc­cu­pa­tion of Iraq and their cen­tral role in sup­port­ing the US- led civil war in Syria against the Baathist regime of Pres­i­dent Bashar al-As­sad, which is be­ing car­ried out by means of Is­lamist mili­tias, in­clud­ing Al Qaeda and the Is­lamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS). The Syr­ian war has be­come a de­ba­cle for the Turk­ish rul­ing elite. Thou­sands of Is­lamist mil­i­tants have used the coun­try as a tran­sit point to join the fight­ing against As­sad, while mil­lions of peo­ple dis­placed by the car­nage have flooded over the bor­ders from Syria seek­ing refuge. In neigh­bour­ing Iraq, ISIS used the man­power and weaponry it gained with Turk­ish as­sis­tance to at­tack the pro- US gov­ern­ment in 2014, prompt­ing Washington to launch a war against the very Is­lamists it had been arm­ing and to de­mand Turk­ish sup­port.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20170521,"Im­por­tance of man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, eco­nomic growth and de­vel­op­ment in Africa","AC­CORD­ING to the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment ( UNCTAD) World In­vest­ment Re­ports (1996-2016), Africa’s For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment (FDI) in­flows in man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has de­creased from 30 per­cent in 1989 to 20 per­cent in 2015; in­flows into the pri­mary sec­tor (ex­trac­tive and agri­cul­ture) slumped from 40 to 20 per­cent over the pe­riod. How­ever, in­flows into the ser­vices sec­tor in­creased from 27 to 51 per­cent. Fac­tors be­hind the de­crease in man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI in­clude, in­ter alia, high tar­iffs and costs of do­ing busi­ness and pro­duc­tion as well as in­suf­fi­cient busi­ness in­fra­struc­ture. Pri­mary sec­tor FDI plum­meted largely due to on­go­ing low com­mod­ity prices that have ham­pered re­source-seek­ing FDI. In fact, com­mod­ity price de­clines re­duced the in­cen­tives to in­vest in the pri­mary sec­tor. In­creas­ing lib­er­al­i­sa­tion and pri­vati­sa­tion of the ser­vices sec­tor, along with grow­ing con­sumer mar­ket and mid­dle class in Africa have at­tracted FDI in ser­vices (mainly fi­nance, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions, tourism, ho­tel and restau­rants, real es­tate). De­spite the over­all FDI de­cline, the World Bank (2015) re­ports that a few coun­tries such as South Africa, Nige­ria, Ghana, Egypt, Kenya, Le­sotho, Tan­za­nia, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia have at­tracted in­creas­ing FDI in man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­tries (like tex­tile and cloth­ing, leather and footwear, ve­hi­cles, to­bacco, food and bev­er­ages) over the years. The model of FDI is mainly green­field projects (mar­ket-seek­ing FDI) driven by mar­ket size and po­ten­tial — en­hanced by the coun­tries’ bet­ter eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, in­te­gra­tion into re­gional and global mar­kets via pref­er­en­tial trade agree­ments with over­seas part­ners, for ex­am­ple, African Growth and Op­por­tu­nity Act (AGOA). In ad­di­tion, other fac­tors such as po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sta­bil­ity as well as macro-eco­nomic and in­vest­ment poli­cies sup­port the ap­peal of these in­vest­ment lo­ca­tions. Uganda In­vest­ment Agency sur­vey (2012) found ac­cess to lo­cal and re­gional mar­kets as the ma­jor fac­tor that in­flu­enced FDI de­ci­sions, fol­lowed by eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and macroe­co­nomic and in­vest­ment poli­cies. The World Bank re­veals that FDI in the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor is dom­i­nated by new (China, In­dia and Brazil) and in­trare­gional part­ners (South Africa, Nige­ria and Kenya) — so-called “South- South FDI”. Man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI from tra­di­tional part­ners (the Euro­pean Union and United States) com­prised a de­creas­ing share over the pe­riod, but was more con­cen­trated and in­creas­ing in the ser­vices sec­tor. Why is man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI im­por­tant to Africa? With in­ad­e­quate re­sources to fi­nance sus­tain­able (in­dus­trial and eco­nomic) de­vel­op­ment in Africa, weak eco­nomic growth, ab­ject poverty and ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment rates, at­tract­ing FDI into the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor is key. FDI into man­u­fac­tur­ing, com­pa­ra­ble to other sec­tors, has great po­ten­tial to cre­ate jobs, al­le­vi­ate poverty, en­hance eco­nomic growth and sup­port in­dus­trial di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion. It has the ca­pac­ity to bol­ster in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion via tech­no­log­i­cal and knowhow trans­fers, in­creas­ing pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity and ex­port per­for­mance. These ar­gu­ments are strongly sup­ported by prac­ti­cal ex­am­ples: Man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI par­tic­u­larly in food and bev­er­ages, mo­tor ve­hi­cles and trans­port equip­ment, tex­tile and cloth­ing, non-metal­lic min­eral prod­ucts gen­er­ated 30 per­cent of to­tal FDI-driven (skilled and un­skilled) jobs in Uganda in 2012, in Tan­za­nia in 2013 (43 per­cent) and Ethiopia in 2014 (28 per­cent) (World Bank 2015). FDI into sim­i­lar sec­tors has helped most South-East Asian economies such as Thai­land, Tai­wan, Hong Kong and South Korea to suc­cess­fully in­dus­tri­alise, up­grade tech­nol­ogy and di­ver­sify their ex­port base. Africa’s quest for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion has been stressed in sev­eral con­ti­nen­tal (re­gional and na­tional) ini­tia­tives. No­tably, the 2008 Plan of Ac­tion for the Ac­cel­er­ated In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment for Africa (Aida) and more re­cently the Agenda 2063 re­it­er­ate the im­por­tance of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and at­tract­ing FDI into man­u­fac­tur­ing was iden­ti­fied as a ma­jor cat­a­lyst for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion by pro­vid­ing the much-needed cap­i­tal, tech­nol­ogy and ex­per­tise shar­ing. Africa hosts the bulk of global chromium and plat­inum (90 per­cent), gold (40 per­cent), oil re­serves (12 per­cent), tim­ber re­sources and other nat­u­ral re­sources; yet it has only one per­cent of world man­u­fac­tur­ing — low­est among com­pa­ra­ble re­gions like Asia, Latin Amer­ica and Tran­si­tional Economies, said UNCTAD. At the same time African coun­tries are “pre­ma­turely de-in­dus­tri­al­is­ing”. This state of af­fairs has re­in­forced the con­ti­nent’s per­pet­ual de­pen­dence on ex­port of tra­di­tional agri­cul­ture, raw ma­te­ri­als (oil, nat­u­ral gas and min­er­als) and in­ter­me­di­ate prod­ucts with low value added. Over­re­liance on raw ma­te­rial ex­ports has in re­cent years ex­posed many re­source-de­pen­dent economies such as Al­ge­ria, Demo­cratic Republic of Congo, South Africa and Nige­ria to (in­vest­ment and po­ten­tial growth) risks of com­mod­ity price de­clines. There­fore, African gov­ern­ments need to at­tract more FDI from within and out­side Africa in man­u­fac­tur­ing to en­able coun­tries to ben­e­fi­ci­ate their abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, di­ver­sify their ex­port and man­u­fac­tur­ing base, en­hance pro­duc­tive ca­pac­ity, and move up value chains (i.e. from raw ma­te­ri­als to fin­ished prod­ucts sup­pli­ers/ex­porters). Man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI would also ac­cel­er­ate in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and boost eco­nomic growth and de­vel­op­ment, cre­ate jobs and al­le­vi­ate poverty. FDI in the pri­mary and ser­vices sec­tors are also cru­cial in this re­spect. Though im­por­tant, FDI does not bring the ben­e­fits to the host econ­omy or re­gion au­to­mat­i­cally. The ac­crual of FDI ben­e­fits to the host econ­omy de­pends on a num­ber of fac­tors. For ex­am­ple, host Gov­ern­ments, need to im­ple­ment poli­cies that can en­cour­age FDI to en­sure rapid growth or ex­pan­sion of the sec­tor (pro­mote sec­toral and spa­tial growth). Labour mar­ket reg­u­la­tions, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights and tax laws, poli­cies aimed at hu­man de­vel­op­ment and ca­pac­ity build­ing, for in­stance, can play a cru­cial role in har­ness­ing the po­ten­tial FDI ben­e­fits. More­over, the ben­e­fits de­pend on the modal­i­ties of the FDI. Green­field in­vest­ment which in­volves new FDI projects may well have greater ben­e­fits than merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions model es­pe­cially with re­gard to job cre­ation. In ad­di­tion, mar­ket-seek­ing FDI gen­er­ates lo­cal and re­gional link­ages, cre­ates new jobs and prod­ucts for lo­cal con­sumers, among other things. This has been seen in ap­parel ex­port­ing coun­tries such as Kenya, Le­sotho and Swazi­land. Equally im­por­tant, ef­fi­ciency-seek­ing FDI en­tails es­tab­lished firms seek­ing to com­pete in in­ter­na­tional mar­kets and it is par­tic­u­larly im­por­tant for economies look­ing to in­te­grate into the global mar­ket and move up the global value and sup­ply chains. Ef­fi­ciency-seek­ing FDI is said to have the strong­est growth im­pact of all FDI types (as has hap­pened in East Asia’s man­u­fac­tur­ing), but its ben­e­fits have not been very pro­nounced in Africa — per­haps since it con­sti­tutes a small por­tion of the con­ti­nent’s FDI. Ex­pe­ri­ence has shown that lo­cal sup­pli­ers and com­peti­tors ben­e­fit from this type of FDI through adap­tion and im­i­ta­tion. Strate­gic-as­set seek­ing FDI is barely present in Africa. It is also im­por­tant to note man­u­fac­tur­ing (es­pe­cially in high-tech in­dus­tries) FDI poses some chal­lenges (e.g. loss of man­ual jobs to au­to­ma­tion, from un­skilled to skilled jobs) but its ad­verse ef­fects should not be over­stated nor ob­scure its ben­e­fits. Vi­able so­lu­tions, how­ever, can mit­i­gate these neg­a­tive ef­fects, for ex­am­ple, suf­fi­cient for­mal ed­u­ca­tion, train­ing and so­cial pro­grammes can quickly as­sist work­ers and en­able them to com­pete for skilled jobs. In the con­text of this nar­ra­tive, African Gov­ern­ments, in­di­vid­u­ally or col­lec­tively, must care­fully con­sider what it takes to at­tract the type and model of FDI that com­ple­ments the host econ­omy’s de­vel­op­ment agenda. Trade open­ness, im­prov­ing cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and busi­ness in­fra­struc­ture are key in at­tract­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing FDI. In­cen­tives may also be im­por­tant, but the risk of in­cen­tive de­pen­dence needs to be con­sid­ered. These are im­por­tant in the over­all as­sess­ment of FDI des­ti­na­tions and de­ci­sions — in­vestors weigh up the risk-re­turn pro­files of dif­fer­ent in­vest­ment lo­ca­tions. Talk­more Chid­ede is a re­searcher with the Trade and Law Cen­tre, a think tank that mon­i­tors trade pat­terns in Africa.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200403,Put Zim­dol­lar on gold stan­dard,"FROM the un­doubted and in­spired pas­sages of the Holy Bible we get glimpses of the land of Ophir. The land got the name from one of the sons of Jok­tan, an early de­scen­dant of Noah af­ter the great flood. Ophir mi­grated south­wards af­ter the great flood of Noah and the land where he set­tled came to be re­ferred re­peat­edly in the Bible as the “the land of Ophir.” In 1 Kings 9:28 we learn that King Solomon sent his men to­gether with those of King Hi­ram to Ophir and they brought back 420 tal­ents of gold. At one point, King Solomon had re­serves of 3 000 (225 tons) tal­ents of gold from Ophir which he do­nated for the con­struc­tion of the Lord’s Tem­ple. Un­like his father King David who spent time wag­ing war and col­lect­ing fore­skins from van­quished Philistines, King Solomon was a great and shrewd deal­maker. Next, we get our cue card and roadmap from trees and wild an­i­mals. King Solomon re­ceived al­gum wood (used in­ter­change­ably with al­mug) from King Hi­ram who ob­tained it from Ophir. The word al­gum sug­gests that the wood was in the form of planks but does not spec­ify the type of tree. But we are told King Solomon used it for sup­ports and steps in the con­struc­tion of the tem­ple and Royal Palace. This clearly in­di­cates the wood was from hard­wood trees such as mukwa, teak and ma­hogany. These are some of the hard­est woods in the world and they are found in the sa­vanna lands of south­ern Africa which in­clude the Zim­babwe of to­day. We then learn that the ships brought ivory, gold, apes and ba­boons pre­sum­ably from Ophir on their three yearly voy­ages. All these are also to be found in the area cov­er­ing the lat­ter day ter­ri­tory of south­ern Africa. The 3 420 tal­ents of gold (260 tons) men­tioned by num­ber from Ophir rep­re­sent an enor­mous trea­sure of gold. Any min­ing en­gi­neer will know this rep­re­sents a huge and spec­tac­u­lar min­ing op­er­a­tion. Such an op­er­a­tion would be an awe­some en­gi­neer­ing fit and would come with a huge dump­site. For all in­tents and pur­poses, we can safely con­clude that our present-day Zim­babwe is sit­ting snugly on the an­cient bib­li­cal ter­ri­tory of Ophir, a land laden with gold like no other men­tioned in the Bible. The coun­try should there­fore move with haste to re­claim its Bib­li­cal her­itage and restyle its name to Zim­bab­weOphir. This is cer­tainly a more pleas­ing dou­ble-bar­relled name than the old moniker Zim­babwe-Rhode­sia. Turn­ing now to the sit­u­a­tion in Zim­babwe, these are well known facts. The coun­try has no for­eign ex­change re­serves of note with which to sup­port its cur­rency. The coun­try has poor, out-dated in­dus­trial machin­ery and in­suf­fi­cient elec­tric­ity sup­plies and is un­able to pro­duce goods com­pet­i­tively for the in­ter­na­tional mar­kets. The coun­try has a bal­ance of pay­ments deficit and a chronic short­age of for­eign ex­change. The ex­change rate of the lo­cal cur­rency is at the mercy and whims of spec­u­la­tors, de­trac­tors and agents provo­ca­teurs. The coun­try has failed to get suf­fi­cient sup­port from in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to sta­bi­lize the ex­change rate. Zim­babwe is one of the most highly min­er­al­ized coun­tries in the world and yet is wal­low­ing in eco­nomic con­fu­sion and poverty. Yet in spite of all these chal­lenges, the coun­try can still have a sta­ble ex­change rate that takes a level cho­sen by the of­fi­cial mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties if the gold stan­dard with spe­cial adap­ta­tions is adopted. The an­cient gold his­tory of the coun­try men­tioned ear­lier and proven by present-day ge­o­log­i­cal re­ports are a strong jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the gold stan­dard. What is the Gold Stan­dard? It is a mon­e­tary sys­tem in which the lo­cal cur­rency is pegged against a fixed quan­tity of gold. And gold has un­ques­tion­able value and is le­gal ten­der in all coun­tries on earth. A cur­rency on the gold stan­dard has un­ques­tion­able value and can­not be at­tacked eas­ily by spec­u­la­tors and agents provo­ca­teurs. All the coun­tries we now call “de­vel­oped” were on the gold stan­dard at crit­i­cal stages of their eco­nomic growth in the 19th cen­tury. Here we talk of the USA, UK, Bel­gium, France, Italy, Spain, Por­tu­gal, Canada and Rus­sia. China was not on the gold stan­dard due to lim­ited gold re­sources but re­sorted to the Silver Stan­dard which worked well for them. Yet all these coun­tries were not wor­thy of men­tion by God in the Bible as sources of gold. So, Zim­babwe oc­cu­pies a place of pride un­der the sun as the only ver­i­ta­ble source of gold on the earth. The an­swer to the cycli­cal eco­nomic poverty trap in Zim­babwe is to put the Zim­babwe Dol­lar on the gold stan­dard with spe­cial adap­ta­tions. The coun­try has more than enough gold to make it work. The an­cient King Solomon cer­tainly showed us the way. And who can doubt the wis­dom of that one? The fail­ure of the RBZ to seize con­trol of the ex­change rate from eco­nomic sabo­teurs and agents provo­ca­teurs is the big­gest cause of ris­ing in­fla­tion in Zim­babwe. For Zim­babwe the gold stan­dard rep­re­sents a home-grown so­lu­tion need­ing no ex­ter­nal in­ter­ven­tion. Its im­ple­men­ta­tion will cer­tainly show Zim­babwe’s spe­cial place of pride un­der the sun be­cause of the abun­dance of its gold. It is a trail blaz­ing en­ter­prise that will show other African coun­tries the value of their nat­u­ral re­sources in eco­nomic en­deav­ors. How do other coun­tries mar­ket their gold and use it to best ad­van­tage? What can Zim­babwe learn? Across the Lim­popo, South Africa mar­kets its gold via the Kruger Rand which is highly re­garded around the world as a bell weather in­vest­ment when times are hard. Be­tween 1974 and 1985 about 22 mil­lion gold Kruger­rand coins were im­ported into the USA alone. This enor­mous suc­cess en­cour­aged other coun­tries to mint and is­sue gold bul­lion coins of their own. So, we had the Cana­dian - Gold Maple Leaf, the Aus­tralian Nugget, the Chi­nese Gold Panda, the Amer­i­can Gold Eagle and the Bri­tish Bri­tan­nia coin. Not­with­stand­ing the fact that the Kruger­rand fea­tures on its ob­verse side Paul Kruger the grand­daddy of apartheid, the coin is the most pop­u­lar in the world. Zim­babwe, on the other hand, mar­kets its gold through jew­elry made by Aurex Jew­elry, a sub­sidiary of the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe. This jew­elry is pop­u­lar with fash­ion­istas and the im­pact of this en­ter­prise on the big­ger eco­nomic pic­ture of Zim­babwe is not known by the com­mon man. Pic­ture in your mind, a pa­tri­otic and cre­ative Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe. They work closely with the Min­istry of Mines which is run­ning a “Com­mand Gold” pro­gram. Ev­ery two weeks they run pub­lic auc­tion to sell gold, the Mun­hu­mu­tapa Gold Se­ries. The se­ries con­sists of minia­ture gold Zim­babwe bird with di­a­mond eyes. The birds weigh 750g, 500g and 350g re­spec­tively - a fam­ily. In­vestors from all over the world are in­vited to come and buy the se­ries. Lo­cals are not ex­cluded and can buy in Zim­babwe Dol­lar at a rate of ex­change de­ter­mined by mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties. These auc­tions can fix the ex­change rate and bring it within con­trol of the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe. What will be the im­pact of putting the lo­cal cur­rency on the gold stan­dard? 1. The USD$/Zim$ will be fixed at a de­sired rate and it will be main­tained there by de­lib­er­ate of­fi­cial con­trol. 2. Prices will come down in a dra­matic and mas­sive man­ner through­out the econ­omy. This is called de­fla­tion. In a ro­bust econ­omy, de­fla­tion is com­pletely un­de­sir­able be­cause it sig­nals a slow­down in eco­nomic growth. But in the case of Zim­babwe at this junc­ture, de­fla­tion is com­pletely de­sir­able be­cause it will come in as a correction of the er­rant and un­jus­ti­fied in­fla­tion in re­cent times. 3. Lo­cal cur­rency in­comes will rise in real terms. 4. The po­lit­i­cal bar in the coun­try will be raised and “pol­i­tics of the stom­ach” will van­ish. Politi­cians whose stock in trade is the mis­ery of the peo­ple will have noth­ing to ped­dle. Con­fi­dence in gov­ern­ment and the bank­ing sys­tem will re­turn. 5. Macro-eco­nomic sta­bil­ity will re­turn and this will at­tract both lo­cal and for­eign in­vest­ment. This will fuel up eco­nomic growth. 6. The RBZ will not need to print more money be­cause the cur­rent stock of cash will in­crease in value. To achieve the same ef­fect as this, the RBZ would need to print more money. This must be avoided. 7. The mech­a­nism of the gold stan­dard will trig­ger bet­ter cir­cu­la­tion of cash out­side and in­side the bank­ing sys­tem. This will elim­i­nate pre­vail­ing pre­mi­ums on cash money over elec­tronic money. 8. The gold stan­dard will en­tice hoarders of money to submit it into the fi­nan­cial sys­tem.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160104,US mil­i­tary to ex­pand global ops in 2016,"THE year 2015 will be re­mem­bered as a year of ex­pand­ing global war­fare and mil­i­tarism. It be­gan with dis­cus­sions of the pos­si­bil­ity of “to­tal war” against Rus­sia over the Ukraine cri­sis, saw new provo­ca­tions against China in the South China Sea, and came to a close amid the es­ca­la­tion of the US and Euro­pean war in Iraq and Syria and the spread of con­flict to Ye­men, Libya and other parts of Africa. The im­pe­ri­al­ist pow­ers are de­ter­mined to make 2016 an even blood­ier and more dan­ger­ous year. Ger­many and Ja­pan are openly remil­i­taris­ing, as their gov­ern­ments seek to white­wash and ra­tio­nalise the crimes of the World War II era. All of the im­pe­ri­al­ist pow­ers have seized on the terror at­tacks in Paris and San Bernardino to place their pop­u­la­tions and economies on a war foot­ing. The most dan­ger­ous fac­tor is the US drive for global dom­i­na­tion. The United States has its hands in vir­tu­ally ev­ery coun­try, em­ploy­ing drone as­sas­si­na­tions, Spe­cial Forces oper­a­tions and a net­work of mil­i­tary bases and agree­ments aimed at es­tab­lish­ing un­chal­lenged mil­i­tary dom­i­na­tion over the planet, along with cy­berspace and outer space. More plans are afoot. Wash­ing­ton is preparing to ex­pand its global bas­ing sys­tem through the ad­di­tion of a “larger net­work en­vi­sioned by the Pen­tagon,” which will in­clude at least four new Spe­cial Forces hubs and nu­mer­ous new “spoke” bases, ac­cord­ing to a New York Times ar­ti­cle pub­lished re­cently. The record of the US spe­cial units, which have emerged as the spear­head of the so-called “war on terror” since 2001, makes clear the mur­der­ous na­ture of the es­ca­lat­ing com­mando war. US Spe­cial Forces have been granted a gen­eral li­cense to carry out violence and may­hem in ev­ery part of the world with to­tal dis­re­gard for in­ter­na­tional law. Thou­sands of US com­man­dos are al­ready op­er­at­ing in be­tween 85 and 130 coun­tries world­wide, ac­cord­ing to vary­ing es­ti­mates by US me­dia sources. The en­larged Spe­cial Forces net­work is only one el­e­ment of a broader strate­gic es­ca­la­tion by Wash­ing­ton. US weapons man­u­fac­tur­ers are col­lab­o­rat­ing with the gov­ern­ment to chan­nel an ex­pand­ing war chest of arms to al­lied gov­ern­ments and proxy forces, with Amer­i­can weapons sales surg­ing in re­cent years. In 2014, to­tal US arms sales jumped by $10 bil­lion to a to­tal of $35 bil­lion, giv­ing US cor­po­ra­tions con­trol over 50 per­cent of the world weapons mar­ket, ac­cord­ing to a con­gres­sional re­port re­leased last week. The in­ten­si­fied drive for a re­di­vi­sion af­fects ev­ery re­gion of the world. Europe Wash­ing­ton is pre-po­si­tion­ing mil­i­tary equip­ment and de­ploy­ing con­ven­tional forces and mil­i­tary “ad­vi­sors” and train­ers through­out Europe in prepa­ra­tion for war against Rus­sia. The US Army plans to dou­ble the num­ber of tanks it has de­ployed to Europe, send­ing an­other full ar­moured bri­gade to the con­ti­nent, ac­com­pa­nied by infantry fight­ing ve­hi­cles and other heavy weapons as well as an ad­di­tional full Army di­vi­sion ded­i­cated to joint oper­a­tions with NATO and Euro­pean mil­i­taries. In Ukraine, US Army forces are train­ing five bat­tal­ions of ac­tive-duty forces and US Spe­cial Forces are part­ner­ing with the Ukrainian mil­i­tary to de­velop Ukraine com­mando units. Asia Pa­cific South Korea, a coun­try that has been tapped to serve as a stag­ing area for US war prepa­ra­tions against China, was the lead­ing im­porter of US arms in 2014, pur­chas­ing nearly $8 bil­lion worth of Amer­i­can-made weaponry. In De­cem­ber, the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­proved the sale of $1,8 bil­lion worth of weapons to Tai­wan, in­clud­ing war­ships pre­vi­ously used by the US Navy and sev­eral ad­vanced mis­sile sys­tems. The sale was the first weapons trans­fer to Tai­wan in years and was clearly in­tended as a provo­ca­tion against Beijing. In the Pa­cific, the US Army’s “Pa­cific Path­ways” pro­gram is co­or­di­nat­ing joint oper­a­tions with Asia-Pa­cific mil­i­taries. In the course of 2015, the pro­gram saw the US con­duct joint drills with units from Aus­tralia, In­done­sia, Ja­pan, the Philip­pines, Malaysia, Mon­go­lia, South Korea and Thai­land. Mid­dle East Lead­ing pur­chasers of US weapons in 2014 in­cluded the ul­tra-re­ac­tionary regimes of Saudi Ara­bia, which pur­chased $4 bil­lion worth of TOW mis­siles, and Qatar, which pur­chased $9,8 bil­lion worth of US arms. Qatar has been a ma­jor backer of Is­lamist forces in Syria in the US-backed civil war against As­sad. The US has spear­headed a new im­pe­ri­al­ist carve-up of the en­tire re­gion, with Bri­tain, France and Ger­many pil­ing into the wars in Iraq and Syria to­ward the end of 2015 and Saudi Ara­bia lead­ing a US-backed war in Ye­men. Africa To­tal arms sales to Africa - par­tic­u­larly in the oil-rich re­gions - in­creased by 50 per­cent be­tween 2010 and 2014 over the pre­vi­ous five-year pe­riod. Cameroon and Nige­ria, which are col­lab­o­rat­ing with the grow­ing US in­ter­ven­tion in West Africa in the name of the “fight against Boko Haram”, were among the lead­ing im­porters of weapons. Prepa­ra­tions are un­der­way to re­launch mil­i­tary oper­a­tions in Libya, al­ready dev­as­tated by the US-NATO war that over­threw and mur­dered Muam­mar Gaddafi in 2011. Cy­ber and outer space Even cy­berspace and outer space are not ex­empt from the US-led mil­i­tari­sa­tion drive. In Novem­ber, the US was one of only four coun­tries to vote against a United Na­tions res­o­lu­tion, “No First Place­ment of Weapons in Outer Space”, which was sup­ported by more than 120 mem­ber states. The ex­pe­ri­ence of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion has un­der­scored the im­pos­si­bil­ity of op­pos­ing im­pe­ri­al­ist war out­side of a strug­gle against the cap­i­tal­ist sys­tem and all of its po­lit­i­cal rep­re­sen­ta­tives. Hav­ing won of­fice in 2008 as an an­ti­war can­di­date, pre­sent­ing him­self as an op­po­nent of the war in Iraq and an an­ti­dote to the mil­i­tarism of the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, Pres­i­dent Obama has presided over an es­ca­la­tion of the war in Afghanistan, wars for regime change in Libya and Syria, and a new war in Iraq. Obama’s talk about end­ing the war in Afghanistan has been ex­posed by his de­ci­sion to keep thou­sands of US troops in the coun­try and the plans to es­tab- lish per­ma­nent US bases there. All of his pledges of “no ground troops” or “boots on the ground” in Iraq and Syria have been ex­posed as lies. The di­vi­sions that ex­ist within the US rul­ing elite and the state over for­eign and mil­i­tary pol­icy con­cern the fo­cus and meth­ods of US ef­forts to dom­i­nate the ter­ri­tory and re­sources of the world, with the Obama White House ar­gu­ing for a con­cen­tra­tion on the strug­gle against China and his op­po­nents de­mand­ing a larger com­mit­ment of troops and weapons to turn the Mid­dle East into a de facto US colony. But there is no “peace fac­tion” within the cor­po­rate and po­lit­i­cal es­tab­lish­ment, or ei­ther of the two big-busi­ness par­ties. One side of the global cri­sis is the slide to­ward a new world war. The other is the de­vel­op­ment of rev­o­lu­tion­ary strug­gles by the work­ing class. Vast re­sources are al­lo­cated to de­struc­tion and war, while grow­ing sec­tions of the US pop­u­la­tion are pushed into poverty and forced to strug­gle for ba­sic ne­ces­si­ties such as hous­ing, ed­u­ca­tion, nu­tri­tion and health care. The strug­gle against war can be con­ducted only on the ba­sis of the in­de­pen­dent mo­bil­i­sa­tion of the work­ing class in the US and in­ter­na­tion­ally against im­pe­ri­al­ism on the ba­sis of a so­cial­ist and in­ter­na­tion­al­ist rev­o­lu­tion­ary pro­gram. - WSWS.",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20160214,Eco­nomic chal­lenges re­quire multi-faceted ap­proch,"ZIM­BABWE’S eco­nomic chal­lenges are multi-faceted, as such re­quire a multi-faceted ap­proach to solve them. The chal­lenges range from low in­vestor con­fi­dence among po­ten­tial for­eign in­vestors and even among lo­cals, high cost coun­try com­pared with the rest of the Sadc since dol­lar­i­sa­tion, ease of do­ing busi­ness, lack of mon­e­tary pol­icy sovereignty, bud­get deficits, lim­ited fis­cal space, low do­mes­tic out­put, neg­a­tive bal­ance of trade and pay­ments, high lev­els of sov­er­eign debt bur­den among oth­ers. Need for eco­nomic re­form and trans­for­ma­tion Emerg­ing economies like China have em­barked on eco­nomic re­forms and they have never looked back. Af­ter main­tain­ing poli­cies that kept the econ­omy very poor, stag­nant, cen­trally-con­trolled, se­verely in­ef­fi­cient, and rel­a­tively iso­lated from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity and global econ­omy, China has be­come the pride of eco­nomic growth and pros­per­ity, be­cause of the eco­nomic re­forms em­barked on barely 36 years ago. Since the de­ci­sion to open up to for­eign trade and in­vest­ment and im­ple­men­ta­tion of free mar­ket re­forms in 1979, China has be­come the world’s fastest-grow­ing econ­omy, with real an­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) growth av­er­ag­ing about 10 per­cent through 2014. This is a liv­ing tes­ti­mony that eco­nomic re­forms do work. Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pa­trick Chinamasa, last week on Mon­day vowed more eco­nomic re­forms to at­tract FDI, in ac­knowl­edge­ment of the fact that FDI is the panacea for eco­nomic growth and re­cov­ery of the econ­omy. Min­is­ter Chinamasa re­it­er­ated the need for the re­vi­sion of the indi­geni­sa­tion laws, clear­ing of the debt ar­rears, and im­prov­ing ease of do­ing busi­ness and cost of do­ing busi­ness in Zim­babwe. “All our chal­lenges are largely to do with con­fi­dence; con­fi­dence in our own peo­ple and in what we do,”he said. “We need to gain con­fi­dence of for­eign­ers who may want to come and in­vest in our coun­try and that con­fi­dence can only come if we cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment that in­duces con­fi­dence”. For­eign Di­rect In­vest­ment: In or­der to at­tract FDI, Zim­babwe has to make con­di­tions at­trac­tive to FDI. FDI in­flows are a strong lev­er­age for eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment across the coun­tries. It serves as an im­por­tant source of sup­ply of liq­uid­ity and funds for do­mes­tic in­vest­ment, ie they pro­mote cap­i­tal for­ma­tion and con­di­tions for knowl­edge trans­fer into the host coun­try. The abil­ity of Zim­babwe to at­tract FDI is key to eco­nomic growth and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, not­with­stand­ing the need for in­dige­nous own­er­ship of re­sources and fac­tors of pro­duc­tion. Multi­na­tional Com­pa­nies (MNCs) that in­tend to in­vest abroad of­ten have choices in terms of which coun­try to in­vest in. They are most likely to in­vest in a coun­try that of­fers them the most favourable con­di­tions in the re­gion. The ar­gu­ment here is that FDI is the most fac­tor that can un­lock eco­nomic growth for Zim­babwe. Zim­babwe should look ev­ery­where in its quest to at­tract FDI in­flows. That is, the ba­sis for be­ing part of the global eco­nomic fam­ily. China’s in­vest­ments in in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment in the form of loans is quite com­mend­able, how­ever, that should be strongly sup­ported by en­ter­prise-led in­no­va­tion to boost the pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity of the econ­omy, turn com­mod­ity driven ex­ports into value added ex­ports. We need to have more of the like of the Dan­gote in­vest­ment model, that is, en­ter­prise de­vel­op­ment driven in­vest­ments. Let’s have more en­ter­prises cre­ated by both lo­cal par­tic­i­pants and for­eign­ers. Our econ­omy at the mo­ment is min­er­als ex­port and agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties driven and de­pen­dent. We have all seen the chal­lenges of com­mod­ity de­pen­dence in an econ­omy. The volatil­ity of the com­mod­ity prices and er­ratic weather con­di­tions and pat­terns are not do­ing us any good. In the long run, com­mod­ity de­pen­dence can not be sus­tain­able for eco­nomic growth and de­vel­op­ment. The Mon­e­tary Pol­icy State­ment I was se­ri­ously taken aback when the RBZ Gov­er­nor Dr John Man­gudya sug­gested that, I quote, “The is­sue is not nec­es­sar­ily that too lit­tle money flows into Zim­babwe. Rather it is what con­sumers and busi­nesses do with that money . . .” Not that I am sug­gest­ing that there is no need for pru­dent man­age­ment of the liq­uid­ity in the econ­omy through the “plug­ging the leak­ages ap­proach”. The truth is that there are too lit­tle money in­flows into Zim­babwe com­pared to money out­flows, legally or il­le­gally. Our heavy im­port bill on its own is a con­duit for “ex­port­ing liq­uid­ity”. Zim­babwe needs to more than dou­ble its ef­fort to “im­port liq­uid­ity”. We are a dol­larised or multi-cur­rency regime econ­omy, with­out a sov­er­eign cur­rency, lim­it­ing our ca­pac­ity to ex­er­cise full mon­e­tary pol­icy con­trol. As a re­sult at­tract­ing FDI in­flows is not an op­tion, but by de­fault a ne­ces­sity for liq­uid­ity im­por­ta­tion. Quot­ing the Gov­er­nor ver­ba­tim from the Mon­e­tary Pol­icy State­ment, “The strate­gies and pru­den­tial pol­icy mea­sures in this state­ment are in­tended to trans­form the econ­omy through re­bal­anc­ing it away from be­ing a con­sump­tive or su­per­mar­ket econ­omy to a pro­duc­tive one; and away from the high in­ci­dence of cap­i­tal flight char­ac­terised by the ex­ter­nal­i­sa­tion of ex­port sales pro­ceeds to one that safe­guards its hard earned for­eign ex­change re­sources”. Re­bal­anc­ing an econ­omy such as Zim­babwe from be­ing a con­sump­tive (have im­port bill) or su­per­mar­ket econ­omy to a pro­duc­tive one would cer­tainly re­quire Zim­babwe to not only fo­cus in­ward for so­lu­tions, but out­ward as well, i.e. through at­tract­ing as much FDI as pos­si­ble. Dr Man­gudya has come up with a cock­tail of mea­sures to har­ness and plug the econ­omy from il­licit fi­nan­cial flows (IFFs). We strongly com­mend the Gov­er­nor for such pos­i­tive di­rec­tion. It has been long over­due, and it is high time per­pe­tra­tors are brought to book. At the mo­ment, the mar­ket sup­ply of our liq­uid­ity is heav­ily skewed to­wards banked ex­port com­mod­ity re­ceipts and di­as­pora re­mit­tances. If we re­move or fac­tor out di­as­pora re­mit­tances, the sit­u­a­tion can be ap­palling, with the worst source be­ing FDI, since the adop­tion of multi-cur­rency regime in 2009. On the mon­e­tary pol­icy front, yes there has been pos­i­tive mea­sures taken, that is, in the de­vel­op­ment of non-con­ven­tional mon­e­tary pol­icy tools such as the African Ex­port Im­port Bank Trade Backed Fa­cil­ity (AFTRADES) which has a len­der of last re­sort char­ac­ter­is­tics, the Zim­babwe As­set Man­age­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (Zamco) which has stim­u­lus pack­age char­ac­ter­is­tics, in­ter­est rate guide­lines, in­tro­duc­tion of small de­nom­i­na­tion coins (bond coins) and de­mon­eti­sa­tion. How­ever, my ar­gu­ment is that the cock­tail of th­ese mea­sures are more of stabilising in­gre­di­ents than cat­a­lysts and lever­ages to stim­u­late eco­nomic growth. Zim­bab­wean econ­omy needs a more con­certed ef­fort to­wards eco­nomic re­forms and trans­for­ma­tion that will ad­dress th­ese struc­tural prob­lems high­lighted above and in the pre­vi­ous eco­nomic fo­cus col­umns. All this hinges on an en­vi­ron­ment that is con­ducive to at­tract FDI in­flows, a lot of it for that mat­ter. In con­clu­sion, Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic prob­lems are multi-faceted, and as such re­quire multi-faceted ap­proach to the so­lu­tions. That is, de­lib­er­ate eco­nomic re­form and trans­for­ma­tion, cre­ation of a con­duce in­vest­ment en­vi­ron­ment to boost and at­tract both do­mes­tic and for­eign in­vest­ment (FDI), build­ing in­vestor con­fi­dence ac­cord­ingly, stim­u­la­tion of ag­gre­gate de­mand in or­der to plug the econ­omy from de­fla­tion, re­sus­ci­tate pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity to re­duce the im­por­ta­tion bill and ul­ti­mately have a fa­vor­able bal­ance of trade and pay­ments. The list can go on and on. If Zim­babwe could rally be­hind Min­is­ter Chinamasa’s ef­forts, we can turn around our econ­omy.

zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150215,We are be­ing ruled by dream­ers,"What is it that would drive a Cabi­net agenda to ac­com­mo­date is­sues like the con­struc­tion of a new cap­i­tal city in a coun­try that has lit­er­ally shut­down? What will be go­ing on in­side the heads of the men and women that form our Cabi­net when they sit down and se­ri­ously agree to de­lib­er­ate on this fan­tasy? yet the same group of peo­ple has no idea where the money to foot the next gov­ern­ment salary bill will come from. Granted, there is ab­so­lutely noth­ing wrong with the ideas; in fact, it is noble as it’s every­body’s dream that we decongest Harare by con­struct­ing a state-of-the-art cap­i­tal, com­plete with a new State House for the great leader and VIP vil­las built ad­ja­cent to a wildlife sanc­tu­ary and mon­u­ment — but surely we need a se­ri­ous and re­al­is­tic lead­er­ship. What our gov­ern­ment is do­ing, if last week’s me­dia re­ports are to be be­lieved, is be­hav­ing like a pri­mary school pupil who does not have pen­cils, books or shoe pol­ish, but is wor­ry­ing him­self to death over park­ing space for an imag­i­nary state-of-the-art ve­hi­cle that he dreams of buy­ing when he fin­ishes school and gets a job. The new dream cap­i­tal whose con­struc­tion our Cabi­net is so keenly fo­cused on, is en­vis­aged to have luxury ho­tels and shop­ping malls, three-way free­ways, a new Par­lia­ment build­ing sur­rounded by recre­ational parks and gov­ern­ment of­fices and of­fi­cial res­i­dences for the Speaker of Par­lia­ment and Pres­i­dent of Se­nate. In short, our gov­ern­ment is spend­ing a lot of time dis­cussing the con­struc­tion of a multi­bil­lion dollar par­adise city while the econ­omy slides down to un­prece­dented lev­els and poverty reeks through­out the coun­try. Zim­babwe is on fire right now and its peo­ple are strug­gling to sur­vive. The na­tion ex­pects its lead­ers to be con­cerned about the mis­ery that per­vades the coun­try. The last thing they need to be told is that the Pres­i­dent chairs meet­ings where Cabi­net min­is­ters sit and dream of heav­enly nir­vana in the midst of this grim re­al­ity. Hon­estly, how could a coun­try that has failed to pro­vide its cit­i­zens with such ba­sic needs like ad­e­quate food, de­cent shel­ter, jobs, clean drink­ing wa­ter, elec­tric­ity and roads even dream of build­ing luxury cities at a cost that would make even their bene­fac­tors like China think twice be­fore em­bark­ing on such projects? The only plau­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion to this ec- cen­tric­ity is that some­one is out to steal money un­der the guise of plan­ning the dream city whose ex­is­tence will for­ever re­main on pa­per. Fea­si­bil­ity stud­ies will fill sev­eral sharks’ pock­ets with money while iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of part­ners will present an­other op­por­tu­nity for heavy palm greas­ing. But, in the end, noth­ing will ever ma­te­ri­alise out of this folly of sick minds. It is all a game of cre­at­ing thiev­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for our in­sa­tiable politi­cians. Leader of the project has, by the way, been se­lected to be Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment min­is­ter Ig­natius Chombo. What is clear as day is that the ma­jor­ity of the cur­rent crop of our heav­ily re­cy­cled aged politi­cians will not live to see their dream city, were it to be­come re­al­ity. It can­not take a few years to bring our rot­ten econ­omy back on its feet be­fore money can be found to give Zvimba this heav­enly face-lift. What is wor­ry­ing how­ever is that while long-suf­fer­ing Zim­bab­weans grap­ple with the de­bil­i­tat­ing po­lit­i­cally-in­duced eco­nomic de­cay, our politi­cians are living in cloud cuck­ooland, dreaming on how best they could curry favour with the Pres­i­dent. Bring­ing the cap­i­tal city to his home area with all the trap­pings of luxury would be the sure way to at­tract the at­ten­tion of the king — even if it may real­is­ti­cally be pie in the sky.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20191211,Zanu-PF con­fer­ence To­wards Zim­babwe’s full eco­nomic re­cov­ery,"course we are look­ing at food se­cu­rity, so­cial ser­vices and poverty erad­i­ca­tion, macro and eco­nomic stability, re-en­gage­ment, in­clu­sive growth, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, value edi­tion and this will be dis­cussed in de­tail in the­matic com­mit­tees. “It is ex­pected the Min­is­ter of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube will give an over­view of the state of the econ­omy,” he said adding that other Cabi­net min­is­ters will also make pre­sen­ta­tions. A lot of de­vel­op­ments have hap­pened be­tween the two con­fer­ences. Chief among them was the re-in­tro­duc­tion of the Zim­bab­wean dol­lar giv­ing the coun­try con­trol of its fis­cal and mone­tary pol­icy. The Gov­ern­ment made strides in fis­cal con­sol­i­da­tion that in­volved trim­ming of pub­lic ex­pen­di­ture, ramp­ing up rev­enue mo­bil­i­sa­tion and sig­nif­i­cantly re­duc­ing the fis­cal deficit. Through the two per­cent tax, the Gov­ern­ment has also bankrolled key lo­cal in­fras­truc­tural pro­jects such as the du­al­i­sa­tion of the Beit­bridgeHarare high­way and the stretch from the cap­i­tal along the Harare-Bu­l­awayo road. The Gov­ern­ment has also dis­bursed more than $300 mil­lion un­der the de­vo­lu­tion drive to cater for vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties. Last month, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa, speak­ing in Bu­l­awayo, said the Gov­ern­ment was go­ing to in­crease de­vo­lu­tion al­lo­ca­tion from the $703 mil­lion al­lo­cated this year. The pro­vi­sion of af­ford­able trans­port through the re­vival of Zupco saw com­muters pay­ing be­tween $1 and $2 per trip for most ur­ban routes com­pared to $5 be­ing charged by pri­vate kom­bis. The re­forms in the in­vest­ment sec­tor saw Zim­babwe mov­ing 15 steps up the global ease of do­ing busi­ness sur­vey by the World Bank from 155 to 140 with the Gov­ern­ment say­ing more needs to be done to move up the list. In­ter­na­tional re-en­gage­ment with an eco­nomic bias saw Zim­babwe strength­en­ing ties with a num­ber of coun­tries and blocs, among them the Euro­pean Union, United Arab Emi­rates, Rus­sia, Bri­tain, China, Ja­pan, Is­rael and oth­ers. The coun­try also scored a di­plo­matic coup after Sadc re­solved to set aside Oc­to­ber 25 as the sol­i­dar­ity day against il­le­gal sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe and re­solved to con­duct var­i­ous ac­tiv­i­ties in their re­spec­tive coun­tries on the day to call for the im­me­di­ate re­moval of the eco­nomic em­bargo. The regional cam­paign widened be­yond the regional bloc to the en­tire con­ti­nent when the African Union (AU) voiced its ob­jec­tions to the sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe call­ing for their im­me­di­ate re­moval. In­ter­na­tion­ally, China, Cuba and the Non­Aligned Move­ment made strong calls for the re­moval of the sanc­tions. The anti-cor­rup­tion drive by Gov­ern­ment recorded a num­ber of ar­rests in­clud­ing se­nior of­fi­cials most prom­i­nent be­ing for­mer Tourism Min­is­ter Priscah Mup­fu­mira and Dr Jo­ram Gumbo. Other prom­i­nent fig­ures were for­mer Vice Pres­i­dent Phelekezela Mphoko among other of­fi­cials. While the anti-cor­rup­tion fight was wel­comed by Zimbabweans, there have been calls for the speedy pro­cess­ing and con­clu­sion of cases in or­der to boost the fight against graft. Author­i­ties have also been urged to cast their net wider to en­sure an ef­fec­tive elim­i­na­tion of graft. Com­ment­ing on the con­fer­ence un­der­way, African phi­los­o­phy scholar and aca­demic Mr Joel Mukusha said it should come up with res­o­lu­tions to im­prove the peo­ple’s wel­fare. “I think what is crit­i­cal is com­ing up with a frame­work and mech­a­nisms to en­sure that Gov­ern­ment poli­cies are im­ple­mented,” he said. Mr Mukusha said con­cen­trat­ing on the eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals will help bring stability in the prices of goods and ser­vices which are now be­yond the reach of many. A lec­turer of eco­nom­ics at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy (Nust) Mr Steven­son Dh­lamini said the con­fer­ence should also look at in­vest­ments that will cre­ate em­ploy­ment. “I think what is im­por­tant is con­sis­tency in pol­icy. On in­vest­ment, I think there should be bias to­wards in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment,” he said. Mr Dh­lamini said the fight against cor­rup­tion should in­clude putting in place mea­sures to pre­vent cor­rup­tion. An­other eco­nom­ics lec­turer from Lu­pane State Univer­sity Mr Bukhosi Mpofu said, there was need for con­tin­ued re-en­gage­ment to at­tract in­vestors. “The re­brand­ing ex­er­cise is a process and I think more still needs to be done on the re-en­gage­ment side in or­der to win the trust of in­vestors,” he said. SOUTH African power util­ity Eskom is still sup­ply­ing Zim­babwe with 300MW of power out­side peak hours un­der a US$2 mil­lion a month deal with Zesa, Cabi­net was told yes­ter­day. Eskom has sur­plus off-peak power for ex­port but has re­sorted to load shed­ding in South Africa dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, as it noted in a state­ment on Sun­day. The Zim­babwe deal cov­ers off-peak sup­ply and is not af­fected by the Eskom state­ment. A state­ment is­sued by Zesa the same day that load­shed­ding in Zim­babwe was now be­ing im­ple­mented at Stage 2 raised fears in some sec­tors that elec­tric­ity ex­ports from South Africa had been re­duced. But En­ergy and Power De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter For­tune Chasi yes­ter­day told the 44th Cabi­net Meet­ing De­ci­sions Ma­trix me­dia brief­ing that the con­tract still sub­sists de­spite the challenges be­ing faced by Eskom. “Although the South Africans are fac­ing challenges in the power sec­tor they have con­tin­ued to sup­ply us with power,” Min­is­ter Chasi said. “But in our plan­ning we have taken the po­si­tion as Gov­ern­ment that we should di­ver­sify our sources of power even from an im­por­ta­tion point of view. So we are safe and sound at the mo­ment but we are do­ing ev­ery­thing we can so that we achieve our en­ergy se­cu­rity in Zim­babwe. “Should there be challenges in that area I am sure our South Africa broth­ers and sis­ters will com­mu­ni­cate that to us that they are un­able (to con­tinue sup­ply­ing power) but as of now we have not re­ceived such com­mu­ni­ca­tion and we are con­tin­u­ing to re­ceiv­ing power in terms of the un­der­tak­ings that were made in our con­tract with them.” Zesa Hold­ings also said their state­ment on Sun­day did not re­fer to the Eskom deal. “The state­ment from Zesa does not in any man­ner re­fer or re­late to Eskom,” Mr Fullard Gwasira, Zesa Hold­ings spokesper­son said. Mean­while, Cabi­net warned that fuel sta­tions that con­tinue to di­vert petrol and diesel to the black mar­ket would be fined and could lose their li­cences.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20181111,"Time to value add, says ED","PRES­I­DENT Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa has pro­posed an ind­aba on how Zim­babwe should de­velop value chains for the coun­try’s min­ing and agri­cul­ture sec­tors with a view to ad­vanc­ing the twin ob­jec­tives of mod­ernising and in­dus­tri­al­is­ing the econ­omy within 12 years. Such a meet­ing, he said, would be in sync with the tra­jec­tory taken by in­dus­tri­alised na­tions. The Head of State and Gov­ern­ment said this would counter the “re­source curse” and “de­vel­op­ment para­dox” af­flict­ing African coun­tries that are rich in re­sources but plagued by poverty. In his weekly col­umn in The Sun­day Mail, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said it was time Zim­babwe started the jour­ney of de­vel­op­ing value chains nec­es­sary for es­tab­lish­ment of an up­per mid­dle-in­come in­come econ­omy by 2030. “My own view is that the task of mo­bil­is­ing and or­gan­is­ing na­tional knowl­edge and skills in or­der to em­bark on a na­tional ex­er­cise of map­ping crit­i­cal value chains for our de­vel­op­ment strat­egy is an ur­gent task worth pur­su­ing. “Could con­ven­ing a Pres­i­den­tial Sum­mit or Con­fer­ence on Value Chains be the an­swer?” posed the Pres­i­dent. “Coun­tries in our re­gion, most no­tably South Africa, have done such an ex­er­cise. So, too, have coun­tries in Asia which have in­dus­tri­alised. The de­ci­sion to em­bark on such a course in Sadc was taken a few years ago at an Ex­tra­or­di­nary Sum­mit held in Vic­to­ria Falls. “We now need to iso­late each min­eral, and each agri­cul­tural prod­uct — one by one - in or­der to map out strands of value chains by which we trans­form our econ­omy. Time has now come for us to make a start,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Zim­babwe — like most African coun­tries — had the du­bi­ous dis­tinc­tion of fail­ing to ex­ploit its nat­u­ral re­source wealth de­spite be­ing highly min­er­alised. Where pro­duc­tion was tak­ing place, he noted, the coun­try was not de­riv­ing max­i­mum pos­si­ble value as min­er­als and agri­cul­tural pro­duce was be­ing ex­ported ei­ther in raw form or semi-pro­cessed. On the other hand, Ja­pan pos­s­eses no iron ore but ac­counts for more than 10 per­cent of global steel sup­ply. In­dia and Europe pro­duce very lit­tle gold but are re­spon­si­ble for nearly 40 per­cent of its ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. South Africa and Zim­babwe have 80 per­cent of the world’s plat­inum out­put but most of it is ben­e­fi­ci­ated in Ja­pan, Europe and North Amer­ica. China, the US, Is­rael, Bel­gium and In­dia ben­e­fi­ci­ate vir­tu­ally all the world’s di­a­monds with­out min­ing a sin­gle carat at home. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said, “In agri­cul­ture for in­stance, Zim­babwe adds value and ben­e­fi­ci­ates lo­cally only 30 per­cent of the cot­ton she pro­duces. The rest goes abroad as raw cot­ton ex­ports. Our tex­tile in­dus­try is not just small; it is ail­ing. “The story of tobacco is worse, with the coun­try only able to process about two per­cent out of the more than 240 mil­lion kilo­grammes it pro­duced this last sea­son. The rest goes out raw, with our tasty leaf be­ing used as a blend for global brands. “The story of soya and wheat is even more dis­heart­en­ing. There we have some pro­cess­ing ca­pac­ity. Yet the coun­try has not been able to pro­duce enough of both as feed­stock for this in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity! “We have tended to process what we can­not pro­duce, even though we have ev­ery­thing nec­es­sary for that pro­duc­tion,” said the Pres­i­dent. “Equally, we pro­duce top-notch beef but have no leather and tan­ning in­dus­try to talk about. Coun­tries like Ethiopia have a buoy­ant leather in­dus­try which ex­ports to the rest of the world. “In re­spect of min­er­als, we have al­most all the min­er­als that drive world in­dus­tries, but we have ei­ther not mined them, or mined them mod­estly. “Cer­tainly we have not pro­cessed them at all. This is what oth­ers have called ‘the re­source curse’ of Africa, which Zim­babwe has not es­caped.” A holis­tic value chain for the min­ing sec­tor would en­com­pass the ac­tual dig­ging of min­er­als pro­cess­ing, re­fin­ing, fab­ri­ca­tion and mar­ket­ing. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said cre­at­ing such value chains re­quired syn­er­gies with Di­as­pora Zim­bab­weans and in­vest­ment in re­search, de­vel­op­ment and in­no­va­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20200924,"Strike bal­ance be­tween wildlife con­ser­va­tion, de­vel­op­ment","All forms of wildlife traf­fick­ing taken to­gether con­sti­tute one of the most lu­cra­tive forms of il­licit trade, with the United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme es­ti­mat­ing the value of il­le­gal trade at be­tween US$ 7 bil­lio­nand $23 bil­lion per year. This makes wildlife crime one of the most lu­cra­tive il­le­gal busi­nesses run by so­phis­ti­cated, in­ter­na­tional crim­i­nal syn­di­cates. Our Agric & En­vi­ron­ment Editor Tsiko ( ST), speaks to Mu­fute ( OM), the African Wildlife Foun­da­tion ( AWF) Zim­babwe coun­try di­rec­tor about il­le­gal wildlife traf­fick­ing in Africa. ST: Chim­panzees and other apes are en­dan­gered species with only around 200 000 left in the wild. Wildlife ex­perts say their num­bers are pro­jected to de­cline by 80 per­cent by 2050 due to habi­tat loss, dis­eases and poach­ing, com­pounded by their slow re­pro­duc­tion rate. Il­le­gal traf­fick­ing is still wide­spread in Africa and re­cently, at least 25 go­ril­las and chim­panzees taken il­le­gally from the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo (DRC) were seized re­cently at Chirundu Bor­der Post in Zim­babwe, where four sus­pected traf­fick­ers were ar­rested en route to South Africa. What is your gen­eral com­ment about the re­cov­ery and ar­rest of the traf­fick­ers? OM: The ar­rest shows the level of vig­i­lance our law en­force­ment of­fi­cers are at our bor­ders. More sup­port is needed to en­sure that this is main­tained. Some­thing of con­cern is how these traf­fick­ers passed through the bor­der be­tween Zam­bia and DRC with­out be­ing de­tected. Some baby chimps, for ex­am­ple, taken from their moth­ers of­ten end up very dis­tressed and die. Ba­bies rather than adult chimps as well as go­ril­las, are traf­ficked be­cause the adults are too strong for peo­ple to han­dle. So the adults end up be­ing shot. They are also trans­ported in cages and cov­ered trucks to avoid be­ing de­tected by law en­forcers, fur­ther adding to their dis­tress. I would like to com­mend the law en­force­ment of­fi­cers who worked to­gether to ar­rest the traf­fick­ers. This is a great show of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion and I hope it mo­ti­vates coun­tries to col­lab­o­rate even more in or­der to fight il­le­gal wildlife trade, which has proven to be a trans­bound­ary crime, just like the drug trade and hu­man traf­fick­ing. Agen­cies like AWF can help. We are cur­rently work­ing with Zim­babwe and Zam­bian au­thor­i­ties to se­cure the cross-boundary area along the Zam­bezi. ST: How preva­lent is wildlife crime in Africa? Which are the hard­est hit coun­tries in terms of wildlife re­lated crimes? OM: Wildlife crime is very com­mon — it oc­curs in all coun­tries where the poached and traf­ficked species ex­ist in the wild. No coun­try where ele­phants, rhi­nos, pan­golins and other such species oc­cur is safe from the wildlife crim­i­nals. Where the species do not oc­cur nat­u­rally in the wild, such coun­tries are used as traf­fick­ing routes or tran­sit as the crime is transna­tional un­til the wildlife prod­ucts get to the con­sumer coun­tries. Some of the hard­est hit coun­tries (source, tran­sit and des­ti­na­tion) are South Africa, Mozam­bique, DRC, Cameroon, Botswana, Namibia, Kenya, Uganda, Tan­za­nia, Nige­ria, Ethiopia, CAR, Sin­ga­pore, Cam­bo­dia, Malaysia, Viet­nam, Philip­pines, Thai­land and China. ST: Africa still has a rich wildlife re­source base which is in­creas­ingly com­ing un­der threat from poach­ing and traf­fick­ing. Which are the top five em­blem­atic crea­tures which are se­ri­ously in dan­ger from be­ing killed and har­vested il­le­gally? OM: Rhino, ele­phants, pan­golins, chee­tahs, li­ons in­clud­ing a apes — chimps and go­ril­las. ST: Which wildlife species have gone ex­tinct in Africa due to wildlife crimes and other en­vi­ron­men­tal fac­tors? OM: The west­ern black rhino, cape lion, blue­buck an­te­lope, quagga, Mau­ri­tian fly­ing fox, the dodo. ST: Con­ser­va­tion mea­sures and other mech­a­nisms to pre­vent wildlife traf­fick­ing have been adopted in var­i­ous African coun­tries. Is there any pos­i­tive change you are ob­serv­ing in var­i­ous African coun­tries in terms of de­cline in ivory trade, rhino horn and other wildlife prod­ucts of en­dan­gered species? Is there a ray of hope? OM: Yes, lots of hope. Be­tween 2014-2018, AWF’s sup­ported ele­phant con­ser­va­tion ef­forts was very suc­cess­ful. We were able to re­verse the de­cline of 10 out of 14 ele­phant pop­u­la­tions in nine coun­tries across Africa with a cu­mu­la­tive pop­u­la­tion size of 189 835 in­di­vid­u­als, equiv­a­lent to 46 per­cent of the con­ti­nen­tal pop­u­la­tion. Some coun­tries pre­vi­ously listed by CITES as the Gang of Eight have been re­moved from the list, for ex­am­ple Kenya and Uganda. Poach­ing of ele­phants has gone down — there was a steady in­crease in lev­els of il­le­gal killing of ele­phants in Africa, start­ing in 2006 and peak­ing in 2011, fol­lowed by a steady down­ward trend. The con­ti­nen­tal il­le­gal killing of ele­phants re­mained essen­tially un­changed (con­stant) be­tween 2017 and 2018. For rhi­nos, be­tween 2014-2018, AWF helped to sta­bilise and in­crease rhino num­bers at 10 sites in south­ern and east­ern Africa. In the same pe­riod, seven out of the nine car­ni­vore pop­u­la­tions sup­ported were sta­ble or in­creas­ing, two gi­raffe pop­u­la­tions were in­creas­ing and one out of eight great ape pop­u­la­tions was in­creas­ing — moun­tain go­ril­las in Virunga Mas­sif and Bwindi. Con­ti­nen­tally, there was a grad­ual de­cline in the num­ber of poached rhino in Africa, from the high­est peak in 2015 to 2018. ST: Wildlife re­lated crime is in­creas­ingly be­com­ing so­phis­ti­cated with crim­i­nals and syn­di­cates us­ing an ar­ray of dig­i­tal plat­forms and other tools to per­pe­trate their ac­tiv­i­ties. How is the African Wildlife Foun­da­tion sup­port­ing var­i­ous African coun­tries to up­grade their tools for the con­ser­va­tion of wildlife and pro­tected ar­eas? OM: For anti-traf­fick­ing, AWF has two ini­tia­tives — Ca­nines for Con­ser­va­tion and pros­e­cu­to­rial and ju­di­cial pro­grammes. The Ca­nine for Con­ser­va­tion Pro­gramme has been in­stru­men­tal in ap­pre­hend­ing traf­fick­ers. The ca­nines have ap­pre­hended many ivory, rhino horn and other wildlife prod­ucts traf­fick­ers and hun­dreds of ki­los seized. The AWF Ju­di­cial and Pros­e­cu­to­rial As­sis­tance Pro­gramme sup­ple­ments the ef­forts of the Ca­nines. It en­sures that those ap­pre­hended by the Ca­nines are suc­cess­fully pros­e­cuted. More im­por­tantly, the pro­gramme as­sists gov­ern­ments to im­prove and strengthen their wildlife laws so that very puni­tive mea­sures are taken against wildlife traf­fick­ers, in­clud­ing life sen­tences and as­set for­fei­ture. Re­cently, the Ju­di­cial and Pros­e­cu­to­rial As­sis­tance Pro­gramme added wildlife cy­ber­crime, which is us­ing the cy­berspace tech­nol­ogy to ap­pre­hend the traf­fick­ers. Cur­rently, AWF is train­ing wildlife au­thor­i­ties on this tech­nol­ogy. These ef­forts/ap­proaches — Anti-poach­ing, Ca­nines and Ju­di­cial As­sis­tance have and will ef­fec­tively cut the sup­ply and de­mand chain. AWF is also sup­port­ing the in­stal­la­tion and use of dig­i­talised ra­dio com­mu­ni­ca­tions sys­tems, use of drones for easy de­tec­tion of poach­ers or de­tec­tion of il­le­gal ac­tiv­i­ties, and the use of cam­era traps at strate­gic points such as wa­ter holes or known poach­ers routes. ST: Is the African Wildlife Foun­da­tion en­gag­ing gov­ern­ments and politi­cians to push for re­forms to par­lia­men­tary con­ser­va­tion laws and poli­cies which have largely been blamed as weak and ar­chaic in some cases? OM: Yes, through the Ju­di­cial and Pros­e­cu­to­rial As­sis­tance Pro­gramme, AWF has been at the fore­front to as­sist var­i­ous coun­tries to amend their laws and make it very puni­tive to the of­fend­ers. One pos­i­tive out­come is the amend­ment of the Kenya Wildlife Act 2013, which has very puni­tive laws. The pro­gramme also trains and en­gages multi agen­cies — ju­di­cially, di­rec­torates of pub­lic pros­e­cu­tions, cus­tom, po­lice and rev­enue au­thor­i­ties — in fight­ing the crime. ST: Wildlife traf­fick­ers and crim­i­nal syn­di­cates usu­ally take ad­van­tage of the poor lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties who sur­vive on wildlife and wildlife prod­ucts. How best can African coun­tries en­gage lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties in the con­ser­va­tion and pro­tec­tion of wildlife re­sources? OM: By mak­ing the lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties be­ing part of the nat­u­ral re­source de­ci­sion mak­ing process and own­er­ship. More im­por­tantly by im­prov­ing their liveli­hoods and re­duc­ing de­pen­dence on wildlife re­sources. A pos­i­tive out­come is the sup­port to estab­lish­ment of com­mu­nity wildlife con­ser­van­cies through which they can gen­er­ate rev­enue from tourism. Mit­i­gat­ing hu­man-wildlife con­flicts is also key to en­sur­ing their tol­er­ance hence co­ex­is­tence with wildlife. Com­mu­ni­ties can only be part of the coun­try’s con­ser­va­tion ef­forts if they see value in wildlife and this value can only be seen if there are tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits. African coun­tries must do away with the fortress kind of con­ser­va­tion where com­mu­ni­ties are not part of the con­ser­va­tion ef­forts. ST: Covid-19 has af­fected sev­eral coun­tries which sur­vive on wildlife tourism for their op­er­a­tions to pro­tect wildlife re­sources. What has the AWF done to sup­port the af­fected coun­tries? OM: AWF has con­trib­uted funds to sup­port rangers — salaries, ra­tions and Covid-19 pro­tec­tive gear. We have also sup­ported their op­er­a­tional costs in­clud­ing sup­port to tracker dogs — do­na­tion of trained dogs and fuel for op­er­a­tions. ST: What are your gen­eral hopes for the fu­ture of the African wildlife re­sources in the wake of the con­ti­nent’s rapid ur­ban­i­sa­tion, so­phis­ti­cated crim­i­nal tools and climate change? OM: We must re­main cog­nisant of the fact that the driv­ers of wildlife crime, habi­tat loss and wildlife de­cline is the in­creas­ing hu­man pop­u­la­tion, un­der­ly­ing poverty, in­com­pat­i­ble land uses and in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ments. How­ever, con­ser­va­tion must go hand in hand with de­vel­op­ment, we must there­fore find a bal­ance be­tween the two. The fu­ture of wildlife can be se­cured, if we in­flu­ence the right poli­cies and at the same time ad­dress hu­man needs. Sife­lani Olivia",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190113,Re­flec­tions on Zim­babwe’s de­vel­op­ment,"To de­velop a coun­try and to grow strong, and to be able to share re­spon­si­bil­i­ties with one’s friends and true part­ners, is also about cul­ti­vat­ing one’s own tra­di­tions and to even re­fine the el­e­ments of one’s civil­i­sa­tion, to be cul­tur­ally con­fi­dent, be­ing alive in the an­ces­tral tra­di­tions of cen­turies, if not mil­lenia, and yet try­ing to in­vent one­self in a new and even fu­tur­is­tic form. WHAT does it take to de­velop a coun­try suc­cess­fully and to es­tab­lish long-term sta­bil­ity? What does it take to grow a strong na­tion? It is not just about quan­ti­ties, num­bers and sta­tis­tics. It’s about qual­i­ties as well. To be able to de­velop in these two re­spects, the very ba­sic foun­da­tions have to be es­tab­lished ev­ery­where. Con­fu­cius once said that at first, it is im­por­tant to nour­ish the peo­ple. Hav­ing been asked what else could be done, the Master is said to have replied: “Ed­u­cate them!” In both re­spects, sci­ence and ra­tio­nal­ity as well as - on the other hand - cre­ativ­ity and imag­i­na­tion have to be syn­the­sised and bal­anced to build the foun­da­tions and to nour­ish the peo­ple in a ma­te­rial and in­tel­lec­tual sense. We have a sci­en­tific and a po­etic eye, the great in­ven­tor Ni­cola Tesla said. To ex­plore and de­velop our full po­ten­tial, we have to use both at the same time. Zim­babwe will learn more from its part­ners and friends to de­velop the vis­ual acu­ity on sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. At the same time, it has to open its age-old po­etic eye of African vi­sion and cre­ativ­ity. In this con­text, the en­ergy lev­els of the whole com­mu­nity - that means the en­ergy lev­els, the pos­si­bil­i­ties of self-re­al­i­sa­tion as per­sons, as well as the psy­cho­log­i­cal bal­ance of all the fam­i­lies, the ru­ral and ur­ban so­ci­ety and the State in­sti­tu­tions - have to be raised to higher lev­els of func­tion­al­ity and sta­bil­ity. Based on that, fur­ther lev­els of re­flec­tion can be de­vel­oped. Tal­ents in tech­nol­ogy and sci­ence have to be grown, scouted, pro­moted, and in­te­grated in the process, re­gard­less of their fam­ily back­ground et cetera. Un­der no cir­cum­stance can a State af­ford brain drain. That is key. In the case of Zim­babwe, it has been rightly stated that new tech­nolo­gies have to be im­ple­mented, es­pe­cially in the agri­cul­tural sec­tor first. Mech­a­ni­sa­tion is an ob­vi­ous key­word here. But in ad­di­tion to that more ob­vi­ous as­pect, Zim­babwe is also in a spe­cial po­si­tion to be able to ex­per­i­ment in ways that many de­vel­oped coun­tries can­not. Be­sides build­ing the ba­sic struc­tures, Zim­babwe should also try out new and en­ergy-sav­ing as well as en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly tech­nolo­gies. Zim­babwe can even try to re­alise fu­ture­laden in­ven­tions which are ig­nored in other coun­tries, be­cause the mar­kets are al­ready fix­ated, or strong and pow­er­ful in­ter­ests pre­vent cer­tain re­spec­tive devel­op­ments there. Africa is free to be very cre­ative in this way, and to be­come an ex­pert in the new­est, but un­con­ven­tional forms of tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions. This can’t and doesn’t have to be ex­pen­sive. On the con­trary, such an ex­plo­rative at­ti­tude can even al­ready be started on the level of high school ed­u­ca­tion. Let the kids and teach­ers be cre­ative. Many very new and al­ter­na­tive ideas and thoughts to be found on the web are easy to re­alise and to ex­per­i­ment with. Play­ing with this whole­heart­edly will boost the tech­no­log­i­cal cre­ativ­ity of the younger gen­er­a­tion. New en­ergy-sav­ing or oth­er­wise ben­e­fi­cial tech­nolo­gies could be tested in small ru­ral com­mu­ni­ties and then be spread all over the coun­try, if proven to be suc­cess­ful and ap­pli­ca­ble. New tal­ents can be raised in this way. More peo­ple would be able to help cre­ate an en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly and work­ing sys­tem of needs and com­mu­ni­ca­tion, which also re­flects the idea of com­mu­nity col­lab­o­ra­tion and so­cial jus­tice. In ad­di­tion, ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions in terms of univer­sity level and pro­fes­sional ed­u­ca­tion in tech­nol­ogy could slowly be strength­ened, and new ones should be es­tab­lished na­tion-wide step-by-step. They should also be in­ter­linked with the devel­op­ments men­tioned be­fore. It is more ra­tio­nal to think small in the be­gin­ning, but it is very im­por­tant to pay em­pha­sis on qual­ity and per­sonal ef­forts all the time. The big­gest play­ers in world econ­omy and the most im­por­tant in­ven­tions had small and hum­ble be­gin­nings. But qual­ity and ef­forts have al­ways been a de­ci­sive fac­tor. In the case of a medium-sized coun­try, small in­sti­tu­tions of cre­ativ­ity and learn­ing in these fields should be de­cen­tralised and in­te­grated in all re­gions, but they should also form a net­work at the same time. They have to be su­per­vised by the State in terms of gen­eral qual­ity man­age­ment. Ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions should be man­aged by the State and a ca­pa­ble civil ser­vice, which is re­cruited from the most ca­pa­ble per­sons in terms of knowl­edge and ethics. Such a civil ser­vice can only be built up over time and in the course of the gen­eral de­vel­op­ment. Peo­ple have to learn to pull in one di­rec­tion. What is the best vi­sion to pro­vide di­rec­tion for the de­vel­op­ment and to raise a com­mon pa­tri­otic sen­ti­ment? Those afore­men­tioned ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions should be in­de­pen­dent and com­bine re­search, teach­ing and prac­ti­cal ap­pli­ca­tions for the ben­e­fit of the peo­ple. For Zim­babwe, it would be help­ful to be in­spired by stud­ies on the Hum­bold­tian ideal of univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion, as well as the his­tory of pro­fes­sional ed­u­ca­tion and higher ed­u­ca­tion in en­gi­neer­ing in 19th cen­tury Ger­many. The Ger­mans also be­came suc­cess­ful, be­cause they adopted the best el­e­ments of clas­si­cal teach­ings of for­eign civil­i­sa­tions: an­cient Greece and China would be two ex­am­ples. But of course, that’s not all: to raise the in­te­rior dy­nam­ics of eco­nomic growth and cul­tural re­fine­ments and to pro­vide ma­te­rial and men­tal nour­ish­ment for a hu­man com­mu­nity as a whole, an ex­plicit or­der has to be es­tab­lished which is in ac­cord with the indige­nous foun­da­tions and habits of Zim­bab­wean com­mu­ni­ties. An or­der which pro­vides ori­en­ta­tion and as­sur­ance, the el­e­ments of sta­bil­ity and pro­tec­tion, like the bones in our bod­ies or the shell of a mus­sel. The more the State en­ables peo­ple to lead a bet­ter life in this way, the more their sense for their duty with re­gard to the State in­sti­tu­tions also has to grow. A cer­tain form of user-friendly dis­ci­pline - not a dis­ci­pline of op­pres­sion, but the means of per­sonal and so­cial self-dis­ci­pline - have to be taught and prac­ticed in schools and in vil­lages. The con­science of one’s du­ties with re­gard to the whole of one’s na­tion and civil­i­sa­tion can only grow out of re­spect for the par­tic­u­lar ex­ist­ing State that we live in. If this re­spect is based on a real foun­da­tion, no threat can dis­turb the very foun­da­tions of the com­mu­nity, at least not with re­gard to its very foun­da­tions. Be­sides or­der, flex­i­bil­ity and lee­way are needed for suc­cess­ful devel­op­ments in econ­omy, tech­nol­ogy and trade-busi­ness. Life is about flex­i­bil­ity, about vivid rhythm - and yes, it is also about beauty and joy. Life has an aes­thetic el­e­ment. The nec­es­sary or­der of the state should fur­ther that in­born lim­it­less imag­i­na­tion, which has led mankind fur­ther and fur­ther since an­cient times. Sub-Sa­ha­ran African peo­ple have to, and will, play a much more im­por­tant role in world his­tor­i­cal co-de­vel­op­ment of the fam­i­lies of plan­e­tary civil­i­sa­tions. We are con­nect­ing to form a plan­e­tary whole. Not ev­ery­thing can and should be for­got­ten, but Africa should try to look ahead. Now it has the op­por­tu­nity and it should make the best use of it as quickly as pos­si­ble. For­give­ness (not for­get­ful­ness) is one of the means to gain more strength, and to be more free to achieve a more con­tent and happy ex­is­tence for the State as a whole. As many African peo­ple have suf­fered and still suf­fer from poverty, this, in ad­di­tion, also im­plies the strong ne­ces­sity of early moral ed­u­ca­tion. Be­sides the ab­stract prop­erty rights of per­sons and the more ob­jec­tive el­e­ments of ethics, the sub­jec­tive moral con­science is a ba­sis for a thriv­ing so­cial and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment: Don’t do to oth­ers what you don’t want them to do to you. The role of con­science and the role of ed­u­ca­tion in this re­gard can­not be un­der­stated. Un­der such con­di­tions, a re­li­able or­der of the whole is much eas­ier to or­gan­ise and to sta­bilise un­der the hands of wise gover­nance, and the bal­ance of the mid­dle, the mid­dle in­come and the state of ease and hu­man con­tent­ment can arise. To be­come rich, you have to be­come wise first. But to guar­an­tee that this wealth doesn’t harm oth­ers, or even turns into evil, we also have to nur­ture our moral sub­jec­tiv­ity at all times and in all as­pects of so­ci­ety. Or­der is to be paired with open flex­i­bil­ity and the free­dom to de­velop a true re­spon­si­bil­ity on the side of the mem­bers of so­ci­ety. Both or­der and flex­i­bil­ity have to be ap­plied in the right sense. A suc­cess­ful so­ci­ety is a never-end­ing re­flec­tion, and a dance, of the true prin­ci­ples of life. And of jus­tice; that means com­ple­men­tary and win-win for all sides ac­cord­ing to the re­spec­tive ac­com­plish­ments. There­fore, we have to clear the terms and ways we think, and we have to fo­cus on life, the prob­lems of here and now in an em­i­nent way. What can be de­rived from China’s suc­cess­ful re-emer­gence on the world stage since 1978 is that in­stead of just hop­ing, re­spon­si­bil­ity and self-cul­ti­va­tion have to be made the ab­so­lute pri­or­ity of State in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing the dif­fer­ent as­pects and seg­ments of so­ci­ety and the life of all the fam­i­lies. The more re­spon­si­ble peo­ple are in this re­gard, the more they take care for them­selves, their fam­i­lies and their com­mu­nity and plan­e­tary life as a whole; and the freer and suc­cess­ful their par­tic­u­lar com­mu­nity can act and evolve, the more suc­cess­ful and ra­tio­nal they can re­act to prob­lems. One of the pre-con­di­tions to nur­ture this re­spon­si­bil­ity is a sta­bil­ity which also arises as some­thing in the sub­jec­tive mind of the so­cial in­di­vid­ual: There­fore, we, last but first, also have to know where we come from! If we for­get who we are and where we come from, we run into dan­ger to be­come the mere ob­jects of the com­mer­cial in­ter­ests of oth­ers. To de­velop a coun­try and to grow strong, and to be able to share re­spon­si­bil­i­ties with one’s friends and true part­ners, is also about cul­ti­vat­ing one’s own tra­di­tions and to even re­fine the el­e­ments of one’s civil­i­sa­tion, to be cul­tur­ally con­fi­dent, be­ing alive in the an­ces­tral tra­di­tions of cen­turies, if not mil­lenia, and yet try­ing to in­vent one­self in a new and even fu­tur­is­tic form. China’s afore-men­tioned de­vel­op­ment also meant and still of course does mean an on­go­ing and self-am­pli­fy­ing re­ju­ve­na­tion of the indige­nous cul­tural mem­ory paired with the em­bed­ded open­ness and ea­ger­ness to learn from oth­ers. This is some­thing to study and to learn from. An open na­tion that wants to cre­ate a happy state of ex­is­tence for its cit­i­zens and to be a valu­able part­ner to oth­ers has to find and ap­pre­ci­ate the char­ac­ter­is­tics of its own cul­ture, and to nur­ture es­pe­cially those ba­sic el­e­ments, which are pos­i­tive and fur­ther­ing therein (while for­get­ting those which hin­der progress, of course). There­fore, the im­ple­men­ta­tion of in­fra­struc­ture and busi­nesses should al­ways be par­al­leled with an evolv­ing re­flec­tion on Zim­babwe’s na­tive lan­guages, the cre­ative rein­ven­tion of tra­di­tional mu­sic, lit­er­a­ture and the most ba­sic forms of indige­nous philo­soph­i­cal wis­doms on life. It is im­por­tant to mech­a­nise the agri­cul­ture, to fos­ter dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion et cetera, but at the same time it is also im­por­tant to ask: What brings the peo­ple to­gether? How can they fo­cus and bun­dle their in­ter­ests to­gether, to grow strong as a whole? How can Zim­babwe with its old civil­i­sa­tion and his­tory of trade with China and other parts of Asia find and rein­vent it­self in the 21st cen­tury, and cre­ate a re­al­is­ti­cally op­ti­mistic self-iden­tity in the form of a mul­ti­po­lar and cre­ative as well as eco­nom­i­cally just so­ci­ety with Zim­bab­wean char­ac­ter­is­tics? How can Zim­babwe be­come a mod­ern and fu­tur­is­tic so­ci­ety and at the same time re­vive the strong force of its African cul­tural mem­ory? ◆",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150612,"Tout­ing, vend­ing other jobs in Africa","June 15, 1991) who was a Saint Lu­cian econ­o­mist well-known for his con­tri­bu­tions in the field of eco­nomic devel­op­ment; in 1979 he won the No­bel Me­mo­rial Prize in Eco­nomics. He used in­for­mal sec­tor to de­scribe em­ploy­ment or liveli­hood gen­er­a­tion pri­mar­ily within the de­vel­op­ing world. The term was used to de­scribe a type of em­ploy­ment that was viewed as fall­ing out­side of the mod­ern industrial sec­tor. What is in­ter­est­ing is that gov­ern­ments are al­ways try­ing to reg­u­late their economies through dif­fer­ent poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions in ar­eas such as tax­a­tion. Hernando de Soto Po­lar, a Peru­vian econ­o­mist known for his work on the in­for­mal econ­omy and on the im­por­tance of busi­ness and prop­erty rights, in his book El Otro Sen­dero (1986) (pub­lished in English in 1989 as The Other Path) ar­gues that ex­ces­sive reg­u­la­tion in the Peru­vian (and other Latin Amer­i­can) coun­tries forced a large part of the economies into in­for­mal­ity and thus sti­fling eco­nomic devel­op­ment. While ac­cus­ing the rul­ing class of the 20th cen­tury mer­can­til­ism; an eco­nomic the­ory and prac­tice that fo­cuses on gov­ern­men­tal reg­u­la­tion of a na­tion’s econ­omy, de Soto ad­mires the en­tre­pre­neur­ial spirit of the in­for­mal econ­omy. In a widely cited ex­per­i­ment, de Soto’s team tried to legally reg­is­ter a small gar­ment fac­tory in Lima. This took more than 100 ad­min­is­tra­tive steps and al­most a year of full-time work. In the sec­ond half of the 1990s many schol­ars have started to con­sciously use the term “in­for­mal econ­omy” in­stead of “in­for­mal sec­tor” to re­fer to a broader con­cept that in­cludes en­ter­prises as well as em­ploy­ment in de­vel­op­ing, tran­si­tion, and ad­vanced in­dus­tri­alised economies. Let us look at what the in­for­mal econ­omy looks like closer home. Check how many shops are sell­ing cloth­ing that are run by in­di­vid­u­als procur­ing their stock from South Africa, China and Dubai, among other places. The pro­cure­ment and sell­ing of elec­tronic gad­gets and fur­ni­ture is part of their busi­ness. Th­ese in­di­vid­u­als are al­lowed by the au­thor­i­ties to carry out their busi­ness on a daily ba­sis, ap­par­ently on the ba­sis that they are run­ning their busi­ness in for­mal set­tings. There are other lay­ers in the in­for­mal sec­tor who are con­stantly in run­ning bat­tles with the law en­forcers. The ques­tion that we should pose is where does the in­for­mal econ­omy start and stop. Do we have a “for­mal” in­for­mal econ­omy that is tol­er­ated by the au­thor­i­ties and an­other “in­for­mal” in­for­mal econ­omy that has to be squashed? In the for­mal econ­omy we have multi­na­tional con­glom­er­ates, na­tional com­pa­nies and small en­ter­prises. Th­ese are dif­fer­ent play­ers that are dif­fer­en­ti­ated ac­cord­ing to their sizes. Would it be out of place to as­sume that the in­for­mal econ­omy is in­her­ently struc­tured ac­cord­ing to the size of the play­ers, just like the for­mal econ­omy? Just by scan­ning the lo­cal en­vi­ron­ment, one could see that those that are la­belled as vane zv­inhu zvavo (the ones with their own means); the es­tab­lished crew who op­er­ate a few out­lets of their en­ter­prises across a geo­graphic area, sell­ing a mul­ti­plic­ity of dif­fer­ent com­modi­ties. Then there would be the zvavo zvirikuita (their things are sta­bil­is­ing); the up­com­ing crew who are find­ing their feet run­ning, run­ning busi­ness in shared floor spa­ces. There is the lot that is vul­ner­a­ble to the jaws of poverty, the strug­gling lot, vari kukiya kiya (the ones who are im­pro­vis­ing to put the next meal to­gether). The kiya kiya crew are the ones who are at the mercy of the law en­forcers. In the kiya kiya crew, there is a mix­ture of those sell­ing il­licit mer­chan­dise and oth­ers who are sell­ing gen­uinely pro­cured items, I am not ad­vo­cat­ing for the pro­tec­tion of those sell­ing il­licit stuff. The kiya kiya crew sells their goods in the most of in­for­mal man­ners of do­ing busi­ness; walk­ing around of­fices, res­i­den­tial premises, vend­ing on the streets, sell­ing in public places such as com­muter om­nibus ranks. There is an African proverb that says “It is from a small seed that the gi­ant Iroko tree has its be­gin­ning”. The kiya kiya crew will hope­fully some­day grow into the up­com­ing crew then grad­u­ate to the es­tab­lished crew. The cir­cle of poverty is what forces the kiya kiya crew to brave the con­stant bat­tles with au­thor­i­ties to still con­tinue in busi­ness. Th­ese peo­ple are on the fringes of des­ti­tu­tion, they are hang­ing on the cliffs of star­va­tion; should they fail to re­coup the lit­tle they would have in­vested in the items they would have bought for re­sale. The au­thor­i­ties ar­gue that th­ese peo­ple are break­ing the law by sell­ing in un­des­ig­nated ar­eas and do not have the nec­es­sary trad­ing li­cences. Let me has­ten to pose this ques­tion to the mu­nic­i­pal and other rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties. How many pick-pock­ets do ex­ist on the street of the vast African cities? Do they op­er­ate in des­ig­nated ar­eas? Yeah could be so; sup­pose they al­lo­cate each other ter­ro­to­ries. Can they be iden­ti­fied? Is it not true that we only iden­tify their work when a mo­bile de­vice, wal­let or cash “van­ishes” from some­one’s pocket or hand­bag? Are th­ese pick pock­ets not worse than the kiya kiya young men sell­ing shoes, belts, wal­lets along the street, or the wid­owed moth­ers hawk­ing toma­toes next to the com­muter om­nibus ranks. When the au­thor­i­ties are on the trail of young men try­ing to earn an hon­est living through en­trepreneur­ship; are we not forc­ing them to go un­der­ground as pick­pock­ets. Peo­ple will al­ways have fam­i­lies to feed and ex­tended fam­i­lies that need as­sis­tance. That will not change whether there is low or high un­em­ploy­ment. If we push the wid­ows from sell­ing fruits, we may then be push­ing them into pros­titu- tion for their chil­dren need to be looked af­ter. Why would de­vel­op­ing coun­tries adopt de­vel­oped world poli­cies of thwart­ing in­for­mal econ­omy small traders when th­ese de­vel­op­ing coun­tries can nei­ther cre­ate for­mal em­ploy­ment nor pro­vide so­cial fi­nan­cial sup­port for th­ese poor folk? Pro­vid­ing stalls for peo­ple to sell fruits and veg­eta­bles in more hy­gienic con­di­tions is bet­ter for the con­sumer and for the strug­gling ven­dor try­ing to make a living. Mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties’ levies to prospec­tive ven­dors should be min­i­mal levies. If the streets of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are to be lined by or­gan­ised ven­dors then that should not be seen as an anom­aly just be­cause the street in the de­vel­oped world show lit­tle sign of any of the poor strug­gling to make a living. Guess what, maybe ven­dor stalls lining our streets and nu­mer­ous or­gan­ised flea mar­kets could be the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries’ tourist at­trac­tions. Maybe au­thor­i­ties need to heed the late mu­si­cian Ton­gai Moyo, who in most of his songs ap­pre­ci­ated the kiya kiya crew, he would hail the Hwindis (touts), Mako­rokoza (gold pan­ners), Ton­gai says in one song “even a tout gets to wed one day” (as trans­lated from Shona). Let us re­form the mu­nic­i­pal laws and reg­u­la­tions that are de­tached from plight of so­ci­ety. Were th­ese in­stru­ments drafted with full ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the present state of ram­pant poverty? I guess not. So when are the leg­is­la­tors go­ing to take time to con­tex­tu­alise th­ese seem­ingly ir­rel­e­vant rules? The in­for­mal econ­omy is feed­ing fam­i­lies that could eas­ily be starv­ing. There is a need to or­gan­ise the sec­tor, not frus­trate its op­er­a­tions with me­dieval reg­u­la­tions. We are Africans, we are unique in terms of our cul­ture, econ­omy, his­tory and our peo­ple. Our economies are in­for­mal to a large ex­tent yet we seem to put in place sys­tems to crash the in­for­mal econ­omy. Re­mem­ber ven­dors or touts are job roles whose in­cum­bents are cit­i­zens try­ing to make a living with­out turn­ing into beg­gars. Here is a chal­lenge to the jour­nal­ists, next time you de­cide to pub­lish a pic­ture of a tout or ven­dor who is busy with their daily busi­ness, re­mem­ber your story is in­com­plete. The story is only com­plete when we are shown other pic­tures of the tout’s fam­ily get­ting down to a meal, their chil­dren in school (with school fees fully paid). The po­lice of­fi­cer who stands next to the tout and is seem­ingly do­ing noth­ing about the tout who is sup­posed to be break­ing some law may not be wrong. The of­fi­cer re­alises that the tout is bet­ter off “tout­ing” than pick­pock­et­ing; that is bet­ter for the so­ci­ety at large. We are in Africa, let us recog­nise that the in­for­mal econ­omy is a re­al­ity and here to stay. Tout­ing and vend­ing is gen­uine work in Africa.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170110,"Remit­tances: Fil­ial de­vo­tion, not pa­tri­o­tism","THIS colum­nist is a mem­ber of Zanu-PF. He leads and rep­re­sents the party in the United King­dom and Europe. Re­cently to­gether with 14 other del­e­gates from the UK he at­tended the party’s 16th An­nual Con­fer­ence in Masvingo. A video from a closed ses­sion con­tri­bu­tions was leaked to so­cial me­dia and there was blow back, hys­te­ria and frankly ill-in­formed much ado about noth­ing. Among other things this colum­nist was ac­cused of, was that he de­ferred dis­cus­sion on the Di­as­pora vote and said in the mean­time all those who wanted to vote should come and do so in Zim­babwe. Some felt he did not rep­re­sent their in­ter­ests well there. The re­al­ity is that he at­tended the con­fer­ence rep­re­sent­ing the in­ter­ests of Zanu-PF and those of its mem­bers in the Di­as­pora. The po­si­tion he pre­sented was not only the cur­rent Zanu-PF po­si­tion, but ac­tu­ally the le­gal po­si­tion ob­tain­ing. Now that the dust has set­tled, shall we then have a ma­ture and sober dis­cus­sion on this con­tentious mat­ter. Let us ex­plore the ar­gu­ments be­ing ad­vanced by those who stand on the con­test­ing sides of the ar­gu­ment. This is not the first time this col­umn is cov­er­ing this is­sue, but this week it will be ap­proached from a com­pletely dif­fer­ent an­gle. We will start by say­ing Zim­babwe al­lows any of its adult cit­i­zens to come and reg­is­ter to vote and par­tic­i­pate in all its elec­tions at des­ig­nated places. How­ever, the coun­try does not send elec­tion ma­te­rial out­side the coun­try for its na­tion­als based there, some of whom are per­ma­nently res­i­dent there and some of whom have al­ready adopted the cit­i­zen­ship of their host­ing coun­tries. There is a loud call from both within and out­side the coun­try for Zim­babwe to do just that. The Con­sti­tu­tion has been cited by many as the ba­sis for that ar­gu­ment. Many have par­tic­u­larly cited S155 which says, (among many other things) that the “State must en­sure that all el­i­gi­ble cit­i­zens are reg­is­tered to vote”. It also says that ev­ery ci­ti­zen who is el­i­gi­ble to cast that vote in an elec­tion or ref­er­en­dum should be given an op­por­tu­nity to cast that vote — S155 (2b). It is on this ba­sis that they say the State has an obli­ga­tion to fa­cil­i­tate for the regis­tra­tion of vot­ers, which­ever coun­try they are res­i­dent in. They ar­gue fur­ther that The Fourth Sched­ule gives two qual­i­fi­ca­tions for one’s el­i­gi­bil­ity to vote. The first is that one must be a ci­ti­zen of Zim­babwe. Se­condly, they must be aged 18 and older. These are the pri- mary ba­sis on which they be­lieve that the State is ob­li­gated to send bal­lots to Lon­don, Jo­han­nes­burg or any other far off places where Zim­bab­weans re­side. The State’s view is that this is stretch­ing the mean­ing in­tended by the Con­sti­tu­tion. In mak­ing their ar­gu­ment, those who see a dif­fer­ent view say that the State is ob­li­gated to reg­is­ter any ci­ti­zen who presents them­selves to reg­is­ter to vote at the des­ig­nated reg­is­ter­ing places. It is also ob­li­gated to al­low that per­son to vote when they present at a des­ig­nated polling sta­tion where their name is reg­is­tered to vote. This is re­gard­less of whether they or­di­nar­ily stay in Thai­land, China or Dubai. But that is not to say that the State should send elec­tion in­fras­truc­ture and ma­te­rial to these far off places. One of the ar­gu­ments cited is the re­source lim­i­ta­tion. But we will put that aside and deal with the le­gal ar­gu­ments and then touch on both the ma­te­rial and moral ar­gu­ments. Those op­posed to this “transna­tional vot­ing” ar­gue that the Fourth Sched­ule of the Con­sti­tu­tion also em­pow­ers the Elec­toral Laws to pre­scribe “ad­di­tional res­i­den­tial re­quire- ments”. In this case the Elec­toral Act as amended in May 2015, says that one must be res­i­dent in a constituency at the time of regis­tra­tion (S23). Zim­babwe has 210 con­stituen­cies and none out­side the coun­try. So based on the Elec­toral Act, which a lot be­lieve is in com­pli­ance with the supreme law, peo­ple can only vote in their reg­is­tered con­stituen­cies and not out­side. The com­pli­ance of the Elec­toral Act with the Con­sti­tu­tion has never been con­tested in the Con­sti­tu­tional Court and this colum­nist is not aware of any such im­pend­ing chal­lenges. This is pos­si­bly be­cause of the re­al­i­sa­tion that the Gov­ern­ment is stand­ing on solid ground. So from a le­gal point of view, it ap­pears that the case for a transna­tional vote is not there. This is why this de­bate was de­ferred much to the cha­grin of fel­low Di­as­po­rans. The party has a clear po­si­tion on it. The statutes have a clear po­si­tion on it too. But this is not only about a le­gal ar­gu­ment. There is a moral ar­gu­ment that has also been of­fered. That is Di­as­pora sends hun­dreds of mil­lions, and in a good year bil­lions, in remit­tances to Zim­babwe. Is it such a big thing to ask for bal­lot ma­te­rial to be sent to wher­ever there is a large num­ber of Zim­bab­wean cit­i­zens? This ar­gu­ment is but­tressed by the fact that mon­eys sent by the Di­as­pora to their fam­i­lies have averted many a catas­tro­phe in Zim­babwe. From the 2007-2008 eco­nomic melt­down to the cur­rent chal­lenges. Some have called the Di­as­pora remit­tances the “sanc­tion busters”. Not many peo­ple can ar­gue against these as­ser­tions. Surely, with­out the help from fam­ily mem­bers who live out­side Zim­babwe, it is not an ex­ag­ger­a­tion to say some house­holds if not clans would have sim­ply been “closed”. The Di­as­pora has in­di­rectly con­trib­uted to the well-be­ing of the coun­try. When money is sent to fam­ily mem­bers there is a ma­jor trickle-down ef­fect in the econ­omy and a ma­jor GDP booster. On this ba­sis, it is ar­gued that the Zim­bab­wean fis­cus should bud­get for the ex­penses to bring the vote wher­ever there is a sub­stan­tial body of Zim­bab­wean na­tion­als’ res­i­dent. This is where those op­posed to this ar­gu­ment say that Di­as­pora remit­tances is emo­tional money. It is a sign of fil­ial de­vo­tion. It is not a mark of pa­tri­o­tism. Pay­ing taxes is a mark of pa­tri­o­tism, but not look­ing af­ter your fam­ily mem­bers. Ex­am­ples are given of Zim­bab­weans in the Di­as­pora who have all their sib­lings in the Di­as­pora. These have noth­ing to do with the coun­try the moment both their parents are de­ceased. They don’t send any­more remit­tances and the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe can­not do any­thing about it. They can use their dis­pos­able in­come any­how and there is ab­so­lutely no con­se­quence from the Gov­ern­ment. Com­pare this to some­one who stays in Zim­babwe, con­ducts busi­ness in Zim­babwe or works in Zim­babwe. Pay­ing taxes is not op­tional whereas Di­as­pora remit­tances are. While some con­sider send­ing money home a fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­ity, some con­sider it an act of al­tru­ism. But no­body is known to have done this as a pa­tri­otic re­spon­si­bil­ity. The Gov­ern­ment can­not come call­ing if its cof­fers are de­pleted (as they cur­rently are). They ar­gue that while remit­tances play a ma­jor role in poverty re­duc­tion, they can­not be used to fi­nance voter regis­tra­tion, voter ed­u­ca­tion and the polling it­self in­clud­ing the se­cu­rity of the vote. It is in­ter­est­ing that some be­lieve that one can­not talk about Di­as­pora is­sues with­out talk­ing about the right to have a bal­lot on one’s doorstep. The obli­ga­tion placed by the Con­sti­tu­tion on the State is to make sure ev­ery Zim­bab­wean who present them­selves at the des­ig­nated places with the right doc­u­ments should be al­lowed to reg­is­ter to vote. When polling day comes and they present them­selves at the des­ig­nated place, they should be al­lowed to cast their vote. This is re­gard­less of how long they have stayed out­side the coun­try. This is a very lib­eral rule which even coun­tries like Great Bri­tain do not al­low. In Bri­tain, you can­not come back and reg­is­ter to vote if you have stayed out of the coun­try for 15 years or more. They call it the 15-Year Rule. A lot of coun­tries have a six-year rule. This means that one can only reg­is­ter to vote if they have stayed out­side their home coun­try for less than six years. It might help to look at other ex­am­ples in the so-called mod­ern democ­ra­cies. Canada has a Five-Year Rule. Aus­tralia, which is a coun­try that forces its cit­i­zens to vote, has a Six-Year Rule. Ger­many is more lib­eral with a 25-Year Rule. And yet Zim­babwe has a “Life Time Rule”. So for all in­tends and purposes, Zim­babwe has a more flex­i­ble rule than a lot if not all Western coun­tries. Most Zim­bab­weans in coun­tries like the United King­dom, Aus­tralia and New Zealand al­ready vote there. But for a coun­try like Philip­pines, once you be­come el­i­gi­ble to vote in the coun­try of your res­i­dence, you lose your right to vote in the home coun­try. Di­as­pora remit­tances are a life­saver, poverty al­le­vi­a­tor, an op­por­tu­nity cre­ator, so­cial cap­i­tal of im­mense value and should be val­ued by the whole coun­try. But the truth is sim­ply that they are not a sign of de­vo­tion to one’s coun­try and should not be tied to the right to vote from out­side the coun­try.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20161227,2017: Year for Africa to seek eco­nomic re­cov­ery,"DIVER­SI­FI­CA­TION of African economies is nec­es­sary to drive growth, build mar­ket re­silience and with­stand shocks in the face of chal­leng­ing global eco­nomic con­di­tions. The end of 2016 pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity to take stock of Africa’s re­cent eco­nomic per­for­mance and fu­ture prospects. It’s been a tu­mul­tuous year for some African coun­tries, largely due to a com­modi­ties cri­sis and a global eco­nomic slow­down. Yet there were still pock­ets of good growth that dis­played the huge po­ten­tial of the African con­ti­nent. And 2017 looks to be the year the coun­tries hard­est hit by the cri­sis seek to re­cover from the eco­nomic re­ver­sals of the past few years. Since the start of the new mil­len­nium, av­er­age eco­nomic growth across Africa has been stronger than the global growth rate. Growth across the con­ti­nent av­er­aged five per­cent. This fu­elled the ‘Africa Ris­ing’ nar­ra­tive that per­me­ated pub­lic dis­course. Among the growth driv­ers were a com­mod­ity su­per­cy­cle that pow­ered the economies of re­source-rich coun­tries. And po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic re­forms paved the way for growth in for­eign in­vest­ment. Ur­ban­i­sa­tion and a bur­geon­ing mid­dle class ex­panded con­sumerism while grow­ing mo­bile phone and in­ter­net pen­e­tra­tion spurred the ser­vices sec­tor. In­creased in­no­va­tion in­flu­enced in­vest­ment and pri­vate con­sump­tion. The eco­nomic op­ti­mism of the past two decades has, how­ever, been tem­pered by a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors. These in­clude a world­wide de­cline in com­mod­ity prices, the slow­down and re-bal­anc­ing of China’s econ­omy, widespread drought, es­pe­cially in the east and the south, and ris­ing in­se­cu­rity and in­sta­bil­ity in the Horn of Africa. As they chart the way ahead in 2017 and be­yond, African coun­tries have to con­tend with what has been termed the re­al­ity of a “dou­ble chal­lenge”. There are five that stand out. The first is that African economies must in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, while cre­at­ing and driv­ing em­ploy­ment. The sec­ond is that they must en­sure they are both pro­duc­ers and con­sumers. The third is to re­duce ex­trac­tion while si­mul­ta­ne­ously grow­ing lo­cal in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. Fourth, African gov­ern­ments must build in­fra­struc­ture for in­tra-Africa in­te­gra­tion while con­trol­ling state-bud­get spend­ing. And fi­nally, coun­tries must grow African con­sumer spend­ing while en­cour­ag­ing house­hold sav­ings. Re­source-de­pen­dent coun­tries, such as Ghana and Zam­bia, have re­gressed since the on­set of the com­mod­ity cri­sis. In par­tic­u­lar, oil ex­porters such as Nige­ria have been the hard­est hit. Oil ex­ports ac­count for close to 90 per­cent of Nige­ria’s gov­ern­ment rev­enues and ex­port earn­ings. Even so, Africa still has some of the fastest­grow­ing economies in the world, in­clud­ing Ethiopia, Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Tan­za­nia, Cote d’Ivoire, Rwanda and Kenya. This shows the com­mod­ity prices crash has not af­fected all coun­tries equally. On the con­trary, fuel im­porters such as Kenya have ben­e­fited from the com­mod­ity slump be­cause of lower fuel prices, which have helped to drive their economies. But has this growth stemmed poverty and in­equal­ity? It is clear that African coun­tries have not done enough to re­duce in­equal­ity and turn growth into eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Life ex­pectancy and lit­er­acy rates have im­proved and in­fant mal­nu­tri­tion is be­ing tack­led, but poverty and in­equal­ity have con­tin­ued to blight the African po­lit­i­cal econ­omy. About 43 per­cent of Africans still live on less than $1.25 a day. Cor­rupt and ex­ploita­tive deals, au­thor­i­tar­ian regimes that sup­press demo­cratic ex­pres­sion and atro­cious work­ing con­di­tions for many work­ers con­tinue to sti­fle eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic change. In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is key The pri­mary sec­tor, in­clud­ing agri­cul­ture and ex­trac­tive in­dus­tries will re­main vi­tal for most African coun­tries. But shoring up Africa’s in­dus­trial base is vi­tal to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and job cre­ation. Achiev­ing this will re­quire, among other things, mod­ernising agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. And to be­come sus­tain­able, ex­trac­tive in­dus­tries must con­trib­ute to lo­cal in­dus­trial pro­cess­ing. A key les­son of Africa’s re­cent growth story is that African coun­tries must wean them­selves off their re­liance on re­sources. They must pri­ori­tise ex­port pro­duc­tion and diver­si­fi­ca­tion. Al­though many coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enced growth over the past decades, this growth took place in the con­text of lim­ited eco­nomic diver­si­fi­ca­tion and struc­tural change. Africa’s share of global man­u­fac­tur­ing fell from three per­cent in 1970 to less than two per­cent in 2013. Man­u­fac­tur­ing, at 10 per­cent of to­tal African eco­nomic out­put, is lower than that of other de­vel­op­ing re­gions. Diver­si­fi­ca­tion of African economies is nec­es­sary to drive growth, build mar­ket re­silience and with­stand shocks in the face of chal­leng­ing global eco­nomic con­di­tions. In­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment is crit­i­cal. There is a sig­nif­i­cant de­mand in Africa for ad­e­quate roads, ports, pipe­lines, rail­ways and in­for­ma­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture. Poor in­fra­struc­ture, such as un­re­li­able elec­tric­ity sup­ply, hin­ders pro­duc­tiv­ity and drives up cost. Ac­cord­ing to the World Bank, poor in­fra­struc­ture re­duces pro­duc­tiv­ity by 40 per­cent. Im­prov­ing the macro-eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment is cen­tral to sus­tain­ing re­gional growth. This re­quires that African coun­tries man­age debt ad­e­quately. Sev­eral coun­tries ben­e­fited from the 2005 mul­ti­lat­eral debt re­lief ini­tia­tive, which re­duced $100 bil­lion worth of debt in 30 African coun­tries. This con­trib­uted to coun­tries be­ing able to man­age their debt lev­els bet­ter. In ad­di­tion, many coun­tries, such as Botswana, were care­ful not to raise debt lev­els to un­man­age­able lev­els. As a re­sult of this bet­ter macro-eco­nomic cli­mate, some of them suc­cess­fully is­sued bonds on in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial mar­kets, sig­nalling grow­ing in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal con­fi­dence. The case of Ghana, how­ever, un­der­lines the need for good debt man­age­ment and fis­cal dis­ci­pline. When Ghana’s main ex­ports de­clined — fol­low­ing a fall in the prices of co­coa, gold and oil — the coun­try’s pub­lic debt grew to 70 per­cent of GDP and the cur­rency lost 31 per­cent of its value in 2014. This was due to the gov­ern­ment bor­row­ing heav­ily on pri­vate mar­kets to fi­nance en­ergy sub­si­dies and pub­lic sec­tor salaries at the ex­pense of in­vest­ing in de­vel­op­ment. Road ahead The African con­ti­nent faces nu­mer­ous chal­lenges, but it has a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties to sus­tain growth and de­vel­op­ment. Its ad­van­tages in­clude a grow­ing labour force, ur­ban­i­sa­tion and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances. Africa’s progress has been un­even and has been marked by achieve­ments, re­gres­sions and set­backs. It is clear, nonethe­less, that a firm foun­da­tion for sus­tained growth and de­vel­op­ment ex­ists. Build­ing on this foun­da­tion is en­sur­ing that the con­ti­nent ful­fils un­tapped po­ten­tial.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20170312,Govt em­barks on re­forms for Com­mand Econ­omy,"THE Govern­ment is in­tro­duc­ing ex­ten­sive eco­nomic re­forms to repli­cate the mas­sive pro­duc­tion frame­work cham­pi­oned un­der Com­mand Agri­cul­ture so that other key eco­nomic sec­tors like min­ing, in­fra­struc­ture, in­dus­try and so­cial ser­vices are also re­vi­talised. The suc­cesses of Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s Com­mand Agri­cul­ture pro­gramme have seen Govern­ment re­vis­ing eco­nomic growth es­ti­mates up­wards amidst prospects of a bumper har­vest. It is en­vis­aged that the suc­cess of Com­mand Agri­cul­ture in en­gi­neer­ing an in­stant turn­around in the agri­cul­ture sec­tor and re­ju­ve­nat­ing re­lated sec­tors can be du­pli­cated with sim­i­lar suc­cess across the econ­omy. Our Harare Bureau es­tab­lished that a team of ex­perts from the Of­fice of the Pres­i­dent and Cabi­net is draw­ing up a de­tailed work plan for the ex­ten­sive eco­nomic re­cov­ery pro­gramme, with Cabi­net min­is­ters meet­ing reg­u­larly to make con­tri­bu­tions. It is un­der­stood that the ini­tia­tive in­volves gal­vanis­ing the four Zim-As­set clus­ters — Food Se­cu­rity and Nu­tri­tion, So­cial Ser­vices and Poverty Erad­i­ca­tion, In­fra­struc­ture and Util­i­ties, and Value Ad­di­tion and Ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion — into a com­mand-driven sys­tem. Vice-Pres­i­dent Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa told del­e­gates tour­ing Arda Es­tates in Mata­bele­land South on Thurs­day that: “Com­mand Agri­cul­ture has per­formed be­yond ex­pec­ta­tions. What we are look­ing at as Govern­ment is to have Com­mand Min­ing, Com­mand Health, Com­mand Ed­u­ca­tion so that we can re­vive our econ­omy through these mod­els.” A high-rank­ing Govern­ment of­fi­cial told our Harare Bureau that the Com­mand Econ­omy frame­work was a “work in progress.” “We will cer­tainly speak more about this pro­gramme in the com­ing weeks be­cause it is in the process of be­ing crafted,” he said. Ex­perts are draft­ing a doc­u­ment out­lin­ing the in­fra­struc­ture fund­ing needed as well as modalities to raise the money un­der a com­mand­based sys­tem. Trans­port and In­fras­truc­tural Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Dr Jo­ram Gumbo said his min­istry had made pre­sen­ta­tions at a meet­ing last week and was await­ing the cost­ing ex­er­cise. “The OPC will com­pile all these re­quire­ments into one con­sol­i­dated doc­u­ment be­fore we con­vene again to chart the way for­ward,” he said. Es­ti­mates point to over $100 mil­lion be­ing re­quired to re­pair in­fra­struc­ture dam­aged re­cently by rain and floods. Dr Gumbo said: “On Mon­day all de­part­ments that had their in­fra­struc­ture dam­aged by the floods, in­clud­ing our min­istry, the Min­istry of Health and oth­ers, made pre­sen­ta­tions on the dam­ages to their prop­er­ties coun­try­wide at a meet­ing con­vened by the OPC. At the mo­ment we are at a prepara­tory stage whereby we are mo­bil­is­ing re­sources. Once the re­sources are avail­able we will un­veil a mas­sive in­fra­struc­ture devel­op­ment pro­gramme like no other.” In­di­ca­tions are that in the min­ing sec­tor, the com­mand sys­tem will ap­ply prin­ci­pally to ar­ti­sanal min­ers dig­ging for gold and chrome. Zim­babwe Ar­ti­sanal and Small Scale for Sus­tain­able Min­ing Coun­cil pres­i­dent En­gi­neer Chris Murove said, “ZASMC is de­lighted at the pro­nounce­ment by Vice-Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa ac­cept­ing the con­cept of Com­mand Min­ing. We have been on record say­ing Com­mand Min­ing has the po­ten­tial to dou­ble the ca­pac­ity of gold be­ing pro­duced by ar­ti­sanal min­ers. This is the way the small and medium-scale min­ing sec­tor needs to move for its full po­ten­tial to be re­alised for the ben­e­fit of the na­tion. “ZASMC stands ready to sup­port this ini­tia­tive fully as our sec­tor pre­pares to en­ter this ex­cit­ing phase of com­mand-min­ing.” Deputy Mines and Min­ing Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter En­gi­neer Fred Moyo told our Harare Bureau that Govern­ment had be­gun train­ing and ca­pac­ity-build­ing of small-scale min­ers in prepa­ra­tion of two $100 mil­lion loan fa­cil­i­ties from China and South Korea. The fa­cil­i­ties — ex­tended to the Zim­babwe Min­ing Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion and guar­an­teed by Govern­ment — are ex­pected to con­trib­ute to Com­mand Min­ing. “We have two loan fa­cil­i­ties of $100 mil­lion each from China and Korea and we are hop­ing these will do a lot for the gold sec­tor, es­pe­cially in the ac­tiv­i­ties of small-scale min­ers,” said Eng Moyo. “The money will be com­ing in batches. $5 mil­lion worth of equip­ment will be in the coun­try end of May and we are go­ing to use that as a pilot project and there­after more equip­ment will be com­ing. The train­ing we are con­duct­ing is to make sure that our min­ers are ca­pac­i­tated enough to prop­erly use the equip­ment. It is not only min­ing equip­ment, there will be re­fin­ery equip­ment where we are go­ing to in­stall plants to re­fine our gold.” Eng Moyo said train­ing and ca­pac­ity-build­ing would cas­cade down to dis­trict level to pro­mote max­i­mum use of the equip­ment. “We want to en­sure that the ground is ready and this in­cludes the buy­ers of gold so we are putting ev­ery­thing in place to en­sure that our min­ers, re­finer­ies and Fidelity (Re­fin­ers and Print­ers) is ready for this mas­sive boost.” Com­mand Agri­cul­ture has reg­is­tered re­mark­able re­sults in its first year with es­ti­mates in­di­cat­ing that pro­duc­tion will ex­ceed the tar­geted two mil­lion tonnes of maize. The pro­gramme is be­ing im­ple­mented over a three-year pe­riod with a view to en­sur­ing na­tional food self-suf­fi­ciency. Now Govern­ment is set­ting its sights on an­other pro­gramme called Su­per Agri­cul­ture to in­clude more crops.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160427,Zivhu guns for helm of ru­ral coun­cils,"RU­RAL dis­trict coun­cils have been chal­lenged to take ad­van­tage of the coun­try’s lead­ing trade ex­hi­bi­tions to mar­ket them­selves, Chivi ru­ral dis­trict coun­cil chair­per­son, Dr Killer Zivhu, has said. Dr Zivhu, who is at­tend­ing the Zim­babwe In­ter­na­tional Trade Fair in Bu­l­awayo, said the ZITF and the Harare Agri­cul­tural Show were per­fect op­por­tu­ni­ties for ru­ral coun­cils to exhibit and mar­ket them­selves. He said this would go a long way in ad­ver­tis­ing the busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­ist­ing in their dis­tricts and pos­si­bly at­tract part­ners who may help them de­velop their com­mu­ni­ties. “Next year, we would like to see all dis­trict coun­cils tak­ing part at ZITF. If we had our way, we would even exhibit twice at ZITF, first at a show for lo­cal com­pa­nies and then at one that would have the lo­cal con­cerns and for­eign ones ex­hib- it­ing. We would then fol­low up this with the Harare Agri­cul­tural Show in Au­gust,” said Dr Zivhu. Dr Zivhu said lo­cal au­thor­i­ties should do more than just draw­ing al­lowances for par­tic­i­pat­ing at the ZITF or Harare Agri­cul­tural Show. He said the na­tion would also get to ap­pre­ci­ate chal­lenges be­ing faced by dis­tricts and their suc­cesses. He said there were also arts and crafts to be ex­ported to the rest of the coun­try and be­yond the bor­ders. “The ex­hi­bi­tions are also an op­por­tu­nity for RDCs to pa­rade their art and crafts to a wider mar­ket which in turn would ben­e­fit the peo­ple at grass­roots level in line with the Govern­ment’s ex­pec­ta­tions of poverty alle­vi­a­tion. Let’s move to ZITF as dis­tricts to show­case what we have, not just for the al­lowances,” said Dr Zivhu. Dr Zivhu, who is a mem­ber of the Masvingo Prov­ince Zanu-PF ex­ec­u­tive, has been en­gaged in phil­an­thropic work in the last 20 years. “I like be­ing of ser­vice to the com­mu­nity. It gives me sat­is­fac­tion when I have put smiles on peo­ple. In my first job in 1995, I only took $20 from my $300 salary and used the rest to buy uni­forms and balls for the Dr Zivhu Tour­na­ment which is still run­ning to this date,” he said. In 1998, Dr Zivhu felt some­thing needed to be done to help Zim­bab­wean cross bor­der women and formed the Zim­babwe Cross Bor­der As­so­ci­a­tion for women who fre­quented South Africa and Botswana to sell their wares. The as­so­ci­a­tion grew to in­clude women trad­ing in a num­ber of coun­tries like China and Mau­ri­tius. But Dr Zivhu still felt he still needed to do more for the coun­try’s most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple. He came up with the Zim­babwe Amal­ga­mated Hous­ing As­so­ci­a­tion. “I in­tend mov­ing to Bu­l­awayo as well as to other ru­ral and ur­ban coun­cils. We are tar­get­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety un­der this pro­gramme. These are sin­gle moth­ers and wid­ows. We want to en­sure they have a roof over their heads by pro­vid­ing core houses where they can sim­ply move in. Buy­ing and sell­ing stands at times leaves peo­ple very poor as they fail to build houses even over a long pe­riod,” said Dr Zivhu. He called on Zim­bab­weans to de­velop a cul­ture of self-re­liance. “No-one can solve our prob­lems ex­cept our­selves, we have to be­lieve in who we are and be pa­tri­otic and help de­velop our com­mu­ni­ties and coun­try,” said the busi­ness­man. Dr Zivhu is tipped to win the As­so­ci­a­tion of Ru­ral Dis­trict Coun­cils of Zim­babwe chair­man­ship in elec­tions to be held to­day. He is up against the in­cum­bent David Guy Mu­tasa of Makoni Ru­ral Dis­trict Coun­cil. Farai Chaka­tenda of Chegutu Ru­ral Dis­trict Coun­cil, who has been chair­man of the fi­nance committee of the na­tional ru­ral dis­trict coun­cils’ body, said it was wrong to live un­der the im­pres­sion that the coun­try’s ma­jor ex­hi­bi­tions were for the big boys.",津巴布韦

It is not only min­ing equip­ment, there will be re­fin­ery equip­ment where we are go­ing to in­stall plants to re­fine our gold.” Eng Moyo said train­ing and ca­pac­ity-build­ing would cas­cade down to dis­trict level to pro­mote max­i­mum use of the equip­ment. “We want to en­sure that the ground is ready and this in­cludes the buy­ers of gold so we are put­ting ev­ery­thing in place to en­sure that our min­ers, re­finer­ies and Fidelity (Re­fin­ers and Prin­ters) is ready for this mas­sive boost.” Com­mand Agri­cul­ture has reg­is­tered re­mark­able re­sults in its first year with es­ti­mates in­di­cat­ing that pro­duc­tion will ex­ceed the tar­geted two mil­lion tonnes of maize. The pro­gramme is be­ing im­ple­mented over a three-year pe­riod with a view to en­sur­ing na­tional food self-suf­fi­ciency. Now Gov­ern­ment is set­ting its sights on an­other pro­gramme called Su­per Agri­cul­ture to in­clude more crops. Fund­ing for win­ter wheat cov­er­ing over 50 000 hectares has al­ready been se­cured, while Gov­ern­ment is work­ing on a com­pre­hen­sive tran­si­tion mech­a­nism from sum­mer to win­ter crop­ping. An­chored un­der Com­mand Agri­cul­ture, the com­pre­hen­sive pro­gramme will see es­tab­lish­ment of dry­ers, mills and si­los coun­try­wide. Un­der Su­per Agri­cul­ture, ar­eas like the Zam­bezi Val­ley, Chiredzi and Tokwe-Mukosi in Masvingo will be trageted.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160209,GOVT SETS LOWER MIN­ING FEES:,"GOVERN­MENT has in­tro­duced a new fee struc­ture in the min­ing sec­tor which seeks to en­cour­age in­vest­ment while at the same time in­ter­ro­gat­ing the idea of stan­dar­d­is­ing min­ing fees paid by min­ers to var­i­ous Govern­ment agen­cies and Ru­ral District Coun­cils coun­try­wide to en­sure uni­for­mity and ease of man­age­ment. The move comes amid con­cerns by the min­ing sec­tor that Zim­babwe had a higher fees struc­ture com­pared to those ob­tain­ing in the re­gion. The new struc­ture has around 200 well-de­fined en­tries which also con­tain ex­port per­mit fees for dif­fer­ent min­er­als. Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary Pro­fes­sor Fran­cis Gudyanga last week said the new fees, which were gazetted last month were lower than the pre­vi­ous regime. “There is go­ing to be re­duc­tion in min­ing fees. The pro­posed fees have al­ready been gazetted and there are about 200 en­tries,” said Pro­fes­sor Gudyanga. Un­der the new struc­ture, a cus­tom milling li­cence costs $5 000 per year from $8 000. An ap­pli­ca­tion for an Ex­clu­sive Prospect­ing Or­der is $2 000 (non-re­fund­able), the same price as an ap­pli­ca­tion for a min­ing lease and a trans­fer of a min­ing lease. Some of the fees on the old struc­ture were charged per min­ing district. “It is hereby no­ti­fied that the Min­is­ter of Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment has in terms of Sec­tion 403 of the Mines and Min­er­als Act made reg­u­la­tions. The reg­u­la­tions may be cited as the Min­ing (Gen­eral Amend­ment) Reg­u­la­tions, 2016 (Num­ber 19). “The Min­ing Gen­eral Reg­u­la­tions 1977 pub­lished in Rhode­sia Govern­ment No­tice 247 of 1977 (here­inafter called “prin­ci­pal reg­u­la­tions”) are amended by the re­peal of the se­cond,” said the Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment in the re­cently pub­lished Govern­ment gazette. Govern­ment last year an­nounced that in or­der to en­cour­age in­vest­ment in prospect­ing and ex­plo­ration ac­tiv­i­ties, a fur­ther re­view of se­lected min­ing fees was nec­es­sary. Deputy Min­is­ter Fred Moyo said the new fee struc­ture were crafted af­ter con­sul­ta­tions from dif­fer­ent stake­hold­ers within the sec­tor. “We looked at broader macro-eco­nomic is­sues in­clud­ing com­mod­ity prices and even­tu­ally came up with a new fee struc­ture.” Zim­babwe Min­ers Fed­er­a­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Welling­ton Takavarasha wel­comed the new struc­ture say­ing this was in line with Zim-As­set, “which calls for light-handed pol­icy ap­pli­ca­tion to erad­i­cate poverty”. Mean­while Mines and Min­ing De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Wal­ter Chid­hakwa told The Her­ald Busi­ness last week that a process of com­pil­ing all the fees that are payable to ru­ral district coun­cils by min­ers is un­der­way. “The of­fi­cials from the min­istry are com­pil­ing the fees payable to the var­i­ous ru­ral district coun­cils. That will give us an in­di­ca­tion of the dis­par­i­ties be­tween the var­i­ous lo­cal au­thor­i­ties,” said Min­is­ter Chid­hakwa. The ra­tio­nal­i­sa­tion of min­ing re­lated fees is in the con­text of the pro­posed new min­ing fis­cal regime an­nounced by the Min­is­ter of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Pa­trick Chinamasa in the 2016 Na­tional Bud­get state­ment. A stake­hold­ers’ con­sul­ta­tion process, in­clud­ing in­ter-min­is­te­rial di­a­logue, will fol­low af­ter the mines min­istry con­cludes its re­search cur­rently un­der­way. “Once the com­pi­la­tion is com­plete we will talk to the Min­istry of Lo­cal Govern­ment, Pub­lic works and Na­tional Hous­ing and the Min­istry of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment on the way for­ward,” Min­is­ter Chid­hakwa said. “Based on the find­ings of the re­search and dis­cus­sions with other min­istries we will then take a de­ci­sion on whether to stan­dard­ise the fees and also whether to come up with one col­lec­tion cen­tre. Th­ese are is­sues we will look into af­ter the dis­cus­sions cur­rently un­der­way,” he said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160118,Dan­gote builds gi­ant tomato fac­tory,"KANO (Nige­ria). - It’s a sit­u­a­tion that mir­rors the gi­ant oil in­dus­try, where Nige­ria has abun­dant re­sources but has lacked the ca­pac­ity, will or abil­ity to ex­ploit it, forc­ing a reliance on im­ports. But Africa’s rich­est man Aliko Dan­gote is hop­ing to change tomato pro­duc­tion with a gi­ant fac­tory that will boost do­mes­tic out­put, cre­ate jobs - and even, in­di­rectly, fight Boko Haram. For the past five years, the Dan­gote Group con­glom­er­ate he heads has been work­ing to build a US$20 mil­lion tomato pro­cess­ing plant out­side the north­ern city of Kano. The city and state of the same name has been blighted by poverty and un­em­ploy­ment, seen as key driv­ers to rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion fu­elling the Is­lamist in­sur­gency in the wider north since 2009. But it’s hoped the gi­ant fac­tory, the size of 10 foot­ball pitches, set along­side 17 000 hectares of ir­ri­gated fields, will help by tap­ping a po­ten­tial agri­cul­tural gold­mine. The coun­try’s agriculture min­istry puts an­nual cur­rent de­mand for tomato puree at 900 000 tonnes. When the Dan­gote fac­tory opens from next month it will pro­vide 430 000 tonnes of paste that is used widely in Nige­rian dishes from jollof rice to fiery soups. “Nige­ria is such a huge mar­ket for tomato paste that we will find quite chal­leng­ing to sat­isfy,” the fac­tory’s gen­eral man­ager, Ab­dulka­rim Kaita, told AFP. “Al­ready lo­cal tomato paste pack­ag­ing com­pa­nies have placed or­ders with us which we will have to work hard to sat­isfy. “We are set to be­gin op­er­a­tions. We are only wait­ing for the toma­toes which are ripen­ing in the fields.” Nige­ria grows some 1,5 mil­lion tonnes of toma­toes ev­ery year, mak­ing it the 14th big­gest pro­ducer in the world. But it’s forced to rely on im­ports of tomato puree, mostly from China, be­cause of a lack of pro­cess­ing plants. Dan­gote’s fac­tory, built by Switzer­land-based Syn­genta, will di­rectly em­ploy 120 peo­ple and 50 000 farm­ers have been en­gaged to grow the toma­toes re­quired for the process of mak­ing con­cen­trate. The Cen­tral Bank of Nige­ria has pro­vided tech­ni­cal as­sis­tance such as soft loans for seeds and fer­tiliser. The fac­tory will then buy the pro­duce at com­pet­i­tive rates, said Kaita. Cur­rently, about half of the lo­cal tomato crop rots be­cause of a lack of stor­age fa­cil­i­ties, poor pric­ing and ac­cess to mar­kets, which has prompted many farm­ers to stop cul­ti­va­tion, said the CBN. The im­proved seed va­ri­eties to in­crease yields, ac­cess to chem­i­cals, more up-to-date farm­ing tech­niques and a ready mar­ket for the pro­duce is de­signed to en­tice farm­ers back. “Once we start pro­duc­tion the fac­tory will be pro­vid­ing em­ploy­ment to farm­ers and (the) tomato paste pack­ag­ing in­dus­try, traders, haulage op­er­a­tors and many oth­ers to sup­port the tomato value chain,” said pro­duc­tion man­ager Ash­win Patil. Plans to in­crease pro­duc­tion - and ac­quire an idle tomato paste fac­tory in neigh­bour­ing Kaduna state - are in the pipe­line, he added. For farm­ers such as Yusuf Ado Kadawa, it’s a life­line. “We re­ally in­cur heavy losses from our yield, which rots away due to lack of (a) ready mar­ket for our toma­toes, which is a per­ish­able pro­duce. But now we have a mar­ket close to us,” he said. Pres­i­dent Muham­madu Buhari is keen to di­ver­sify Nige­ria’s econ­omy away from an over-reliance on oil as rev­enues have been se­verely de­pleted by the global slump in crude prices. Former agriculture min­is­ter Ak­in­wumi Adesina, now head of the African De­vel­op­ment Bank, in 2013 de­scribed the sec­tor as “the new oil”. Some 30 per­cent of Nige­ria’s es­ti­mated 170 mil­lion peo­ple are em­ployed in agriculture, mostly at a sub­sis­tence level, although moves have been made to com­mer­cialise pro­duc­tion. - AFP.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161227,Africa’s de­vel­op­ment on firm foot­ing,"THE end of 2016 pro­vides an op­por­tu­nity to take stock of Africa’s re­cent eco­nomic per­for­mance and fu­ture prospects. It’s been a tu­mul­tuous year for some African coun­tries largely due to a com­modi­ties cri­sis and a global eco­nomic slow­down. Yet there were still pock­ets of good growth which dis­played the huge po­ten­tial of the African con­ti­nent. And 2017 looks to be the year the coun­tries hard­est hit by the cri­sis seek to re­cover from the eco­nomic re­ver­sals of the past few years. Since the start of the new mil­len­nium av­er­age eco­nomic growth across Africa has been stronger than the global growth rate. Growth across the con­ti­nent av­er­aged 5 per­cent. This fu­elled the “Africa Ris­ing” nar­ra­tive that per­me­ated pub­lic dis­course. Among the growth driv­ers were a com­mod­ity su­per­cy­cle that pow­ered the economies of re­source-rich coun­tries. And po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic re­forms paved the way for a growth in for­eign in­vest­ment. Ur­ban­i­sa­tion and a bur­geon­ing mid­dle class ex­panded con­sumerism while grow­ing mo­bile phone and in­ter­net pen­e­tra­tion spurred the ser­vices sec­tor. In­creased in­no­va­tion in­flu­enced in­vest­ment and pri­vate con­sump­tion. The eco­nomic op­ti­mism of the past two decades has, how­ever, been tem­pered by a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors. Th­ese in­clude a world­wide de­cline in com­mod­ity prices; the slow­down and re­bal­anc­ing of China’s econ­omy; wide­spread drought, es­pe­cially in the east and the south; and ris­ing in­se­cu­rity and in­sta­bil­ity in the Horn of Africa. As they chart the way ahead in 2017 and be­yond, African coun­tries have to con­tend with what has been termed the re­al­ity of a “dou­ble chal­lenge”. There are five that stand out. The first is that African economies must in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity while cre­at­ing and driv­ing em­ploy­ment. The se­cond is that they must en­sure they are both pro­duc­ers and con­sumers. The third is to re­duce ex­trac­tion while si­mul­ta­ne­ously grow­ing lo­cal in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion. Fourth, African gov­ern­ments must build in­fra­struc­ture for in­tra-Africa in­te­gra­tion while con­trol­ling state-bud­get spend­ing. And fi­nally, coun­tries must grow African con­sumer spend­ing while en­courag- ing house­hold sav­ings. Qual­ity of growth Re­source-de­pen­dent coun­tries — such as Ghana and Zam­bia — have re­gressed since the on­set of the com­mod­ity cri­sis. In par­tic­u­lar, oil ex­porters such as Nige­ria have been the hard­est hit. Oil ex­ports ac­count for close to 90 per­cent of Nige­ria’s gov­ern­ment rev­enues and ex­port earn­ings. Even so, Africa still has some of the fastest-grow­ing economies in the world, in­clud­ing Ethiopia, the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo, Tan­za­nia, Côte d’Ivoire, Rwanda and Kenya. This shows the com­mod­ity prices crash has not af­fected all coun­tries equally. On the con­trary, fuel im­porters such as Kenya have ben­e­fited from the com­mod­ity slump be­cause of lower fuel prices which have helped to drive their economies. But has this growth stemmed poverty and in­equal­ity? It is clear that African coun­tries have not done enough to re­duce in­equal­ity and turn growth into eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. Life ex­pectancy and lit­er­acy rates have im­proved and in­fant mal­nu­tri­tion is be­ing tack­led, but poverty and in­equal­ity have con­tin­ued to blight the African po­lit­i­cal econ­omy. About 43 per­cent of Africans still live on less than US$1.25 a day. Cor­rupt and ex­ploita­tive deals, au­thor­i­tar­ian regimes that sup­press demo­cratic ex­pres­sion, and atro­cious work­ing con­di­tions for many work­ers con­tinue to sti­fle eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and eco­nomic change. In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is key The pri­mary sec­tor, in­clud­ing agri­cul­ture and ex­trac­tive in­dus­tries will re­main vi­tal for most African coun­tries. But shoring up Africa’s in­dus­trial base is vi­tal to eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion and job cre­ation. Achiev­ing this will re­quire, among other things, mod­ernising agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. And to be­come sus­tain­able, ex­trac­tive in­dus­tries must con­trib­ute to lo­cal in­dus­trial pro­cess­ing. A key les­son of Africa’s re­cent growth story is that African coun­tries must wean them­selves off their re­liance on re­sources. They must pri­ori­tise ex­port pro­duc­tion and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion. Although many coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enced growth over the past decades, this growth took place in the con­text of lim­ited eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and struc­tural change. Africa’s share of global man­u­fac­tur­ing fell from 3 per­cent in 1970 to less than 2 per­cent in 2013. Man­u­fac­tur­ing, at 10 per­cent of to­tal African eco­nomic out­put, is lower than that of other de­vel­op­ing re­gions. Di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of African economies is ne­c­es­sary to drive growth, build mar­ket re­silience and with­stand shocks in the face of chal­leng­ing global eco­nomic con­di­tions. In­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment is crit­i­cal. There is a sig­nif­i­cant de­mand in Africa for ad­e­quate roads, ports, pipe­lines, rail­ways and in­for­ma­tion, com­mu­ni­ca­tion and tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture. Poor in­fra­struc­ture – such as un­re­li­able elec­tric­ity sup­ply – hin­ders pro­duc­tiv­ity and drives up cost. Ac­cord­ing to the World Bank, poor in­fra­struc­ture re­duces pro­duc­tiv­ity by 40 per­cent. Man­ag­ing the money Im­prov­ing the macroe­co­nomic en­vi­ron­ment is cen­tral to sus­tain­ing re­gional growth. This re­quires that African coun­tries man­age debt ad­e­quately. Sev­eral coun­tries ben­e­fited from the 2005 mul­ti­lat­eral debt re­lief ini­tia­tive, which re­duced $100 bil­lion worth of debt in 30 African coun­tries. This con­trib­uted to coun­tries be­ing able to man­age their debt lev­els bet­ter. In ad­di­tion, many coun­tries, such as Botswana, were care­ful not to raise debt lev­els to un­man­age­able lev­els. As a re­sult of this bet­ter macroe­co­nomic cli­mate, some of them suc­cess­fully is­sued bonds on in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial mar­kets, sig­nalling grow­ing in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal con­fi­dence. The case of Ghana, how­ever, un­der­lines the need for good debt man­age­ment and fis­cal dis­ci­pline. When Ghana’s main ex­ports de­clined -fol­low­ing a fall in the prices of cocoa, gold and oil - the coun­try’s pub­lic debt grew to 70 per­cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and the cur­rency lost 31 per­cent of its value in 2014. This was due to the gov­ern­ment bor­row­ing heav­ily on pri­vate mar­kets to fi­nance en­ergy sub­si­dies and pub­lic sec­tor salaries at the ex­pense of in­vest­ing in de­vel­op­ment. Road ahead The African con­ti­nent faces nu­mer­ous chal­lenges, but it has a lot of op­por­tu­ni­ties to sus­tain growth and de­vel­op­ment. Its ad­van­tages in­clude a grow­ing labour force, ur­ban­i­sa­tion and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances. Africa’s progress has been un­even and has been marked by achieve­ments, re­gres­sions and set­backs. It is clear, none­the­less, that a firm foun­da­tion for sus­tained growth and de­vel­op­ment ex­ists. Build­ing on this foun­da­tion is vi­tal to en­sur­ing that the con­ti­nent ful­fils its vast un­tapped po­ten­tial. — thecon­ver­sa­tion.com ◆ Mills Soko is an As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor, Grad­u­ate School of Busi­ness, Univer­sity of Cape Town",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190822,Vote-buy­ing against ivory trade ex­posed,"Spe­cial Cor­re­spon­dent in GENEVA, Switzer­land IF you were made to be­lieve that vote rig­ging was only as­so­ci­ated with African pres­i­den­tial elec­tions where the UN al­ways sends well-funded del­e­gates to in­spect them; think again. Right here in Geneva, Switzer­land, at the UN Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Western an­i­mal rights groups and some Western coun­tries are re­port­edly buy­ing votes against ivory trade. Iron­i­cally, this is hap­pen­ing within a UN agency be­long­ing to a fam­ily highly re­garded as the cham­pion of democ­racy, with vote buy­ers and sell­ers go­ing un­pun­ished. In what is a clear case of catch­ing those that steal other CITES mem­ber coun­tries’ votes for ivory and rhino horn etc, af­fected coun­tries have been told to pro­vide ev­i­dence of coun­tries steal­ing their votes. The SADC coun­tries are worst af­fected by vote rig­ging as all Western an­i­mal rights groups and some Western coun­tries con­tinue to block any votes for in­ter­na­tional ivory and rhino horn trade. They do so for emo­tional and not sci­en­tific rea­sons. The is­sue of vote rig­ging is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly top­i­cal as we head to the vote on Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zam­bia and Zim­babwe’s ivory trade pro­posal to­day. At con­fer­ence in Geneva on Tues­day, CITES Sec­re­tary Gen­eral Ivonne Higuero, was asked why the Sec­re­tariat is not in­ves­ti­gat­ing the on­go­ing Western an­i­mal rights groups in­flu­enc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, in or­der to re­store the in­tegrity of the CITES vot­ing process and the im­age of the or­gan­i­sa­tion. This comes at a time when fed up African coun­tries could pull out of CITES in protest over a tainted vot­ing process that robs them of their sov­er­eign rights to trade in their wildlife prod­ucts such as ivory and rhino horn. “I have no ev­i­dence of vote-buy­ing or any­thing like that hap­pen­ing,” said Ms Higuero. “You (mem­ber coun­tries that are com­plain­ing about vote-buy­ing) have to present this ev­i­dence to the CITES Sec­re­tariat.” She cited Res­o­lu­tion 17,3 (mostly in­ef­fec­tive, that calls for vol­un­tary dis­clo­sure by who­ever comes to at­tend CITES meet­ings and is not funded by his or her own gov­ern­ment. How­ever, even here at CoP18 there is ev­i­dence that del­e­gates from‘weak’African gov­ern­ments are be­ing spon­sored in dif­fer­ent ways by Western an­i­mal rights groups but did not de­clare this to the CITES Sec­re­tariat. The CITES Sec­re­tariat is also ob­vi­ously aware and can’t deny that Western an­i­mal rights groups don’t only pay for a trip, food and ac­com­mo­da­tion, in or­der to in­flu­ence a CITES out­come. Other cor­rupt CITES vote-in­flu­enc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties happen well be­fore CITES meet­ings. They in­clude out­right bribery; hon­o­raria pay­ments for lec­tures, Board of Di­rec­tor’s fees, research grants and of­fi­cial vis­its are made to brib­able coun­tries. Ms Higuero was quizzed fur­ther about what CITES is do­ing as a reg­u­la­tory agency to ad­dress the on­go­ing and un­fair shut­ting down of SADC coun­tries’ivory, rhino horn and hunt­ing mar­kets world­wide. She was asked how it would be pos­si­ble for the CITES Sec­re­tariat to con­trib­ute to­wards the achieve­ment of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals (SDGs) by 2030 when hunt­ing, ivory and horn trade mar­kets for Africa were be­ing shut-down world­wide. In re­sponse Ms Higuero did not ex­plain how this was go­ing to in­ter­fere with the at­tain­ment of SDGs. In­stead, she said that shut­ting down do­mes­tic mar­kets was be­ing done by sov­er­eign na­tions and CITES had no con­trol over that. Speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, yes­ter­day a Zim­bab­wean state vet­eri­nar­ian of­fered a solution to the ele­phant over­pop­u­la­tion chal­lenge in SADC coun­tries. “They should stand up to CITES CoP18 and tell the US, Europe and all the Western an­i­mal rights groups to come and air­lift African ele­phants to their own coun­tries or any­where else they please since they (African ele­phants) have been de­val­ued by the ivory trade ban and on­go­ing ivory mar­kets shut-down,” he said. The vet con­tin­ued: “If they (the Western na­tions and their an­i­mal rights groups) don’t re­move 40 000 ex­cess ele­phants from Hwange Na­tional Park, for ex­am­ple, in the next few months, then Zim­babwe or an­other SADC coun­try will be forced to do the right thing - cull the ex­cess ele­phants so that other species and the re­main­ing ele­phant pop­u­la­tions sur­vive.” The Zim­bab­wean vet said that SADC coun­tries should ad­di­tion­ally sue the Western or­gan­i­sa­tions for the costs of main­tain­ing the ex­ces­sive num­ber of an­i­mals and for the gen­eral loss of lesser flora and fauna species. Even African jour­nal­ists fol­low­ing frus­trat­ing events at CITES CoP18 have ob­jected to the way African coun­tries con­tinue to be de­nied the op­por­tu­nity to trade in their wildlife prod­ucts such as ivory. Al­most all SADC coun­tries are cur­rently ele­phant over­pop­u­late. There­fore, there are no valid grounds sci­en­tific or moral that should make any­one stop these sov­er­eign coun­tries from ex­er­cis­ing their rights to trade in their stock­pile ivory. “It ap­pears African gov­ern­ments are blind to take on the fight with the neo-colo­nial in­ter­ests,” said Rwan­dan jour­nal­ist Ger­ald Mbada and author of a book on China-Rwanda eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion. “SADC coun­tries seem to be or­gan­ised but East, West and Cen­tral Africa still are in the dark. Western con­ser­va­tion or­gan­i­sa­tions have bribed the au­thor­i­ties who would be ad­vis­ing gov­ern­ments on the right and Pan-African ap­proach. We are los­ing mil­lions of dol­lars in un­sold ivory yet we go to beg from the West funds to run our na­tional parks. A big shame.” A jour­nal­ist from Botswana also ex­pressed his frus­tra­tion over Western an­i­mal rights groups’ un­jus­ti­fied op­po­si­tion to the ele­phant over-pop­u­lated SADC coun­tries’pro­pos­als to trade in their stock­piled tonnes of ivory.

How can we al­low a per­son to close down our mar­kets invit­ing poverty and we just sit back and con­tinue to be Beg­gars to the colo­nial masters? What is wrong with us?”",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20141224,Mu­gabe spends big amid poverty,"PRES­I­DENT Robert Mu­gabe and his min­is­ters in the Of­fice of the Pres­i­dent and Cab­i­net are liv­ing large de­spite a stub­born eco­nomic cri­sis at a time gov­ern­ment rev­enues are dwin­dling due to a shrink­ing tax base. Fig­ures from the 2015 bud­get state­ment show that much more is be­ing spent fund­ing Mu­gabe’s for­eign trips com­pared to what is al­lo­cated to, say, eco­nomic min­istries which should be spear­head­ing the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­vival ef­forts. This year, Mu­gabe’s of­fice spent close to US$200 mil­lion, while eco­nomic min­istries com­bined spent less than US$115m. Ac­tual fig­ures of ex­pen­di­ture up to Oc­to­ber 2014 out­lined in the blue book pre­sented by Fi­nance min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa a month ago show the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice spent US$161,1m, of which US$32,6m was used on for­eign trips. In 2014, the Of­fice of the Pres­i­dent’s ad­min­is­tra­tion and gen­eral ex­pen­di­ture up to the month of Oc­to­ber to­talled US$153,9m. The money was spent on goods and ser­vices, main­te­nance, un­spec­i­fied pro­grammes as well as em­ploy­ment costs. A fur­ther US$7,1m was spent on state res­i­dences. Mu­gabe is known for glo­be­trot­ting even when the coun­try is burn­ing. This year, he made sev­eral trips to Europe, the Far East and within Africa, gob­bling mil­lions at a time Trea­sury is hard-up. Mu­gabe at­tended the African Union (AU) sum­mit in Ad­dis Ababa, Ethiopia, in Jan­uary where he was elected African Union Bureau vice-chair. In May he trav­elled to Sin­ga­pore where a video of him en­ter­ing a world-class pri­vate hos­pi­tal, Gle­nea­gles Park­way Can­cer Cen­tre, went vi­ral largely be­cause of his wife Grace and two body­guards’ fu­tile at­tempts to stop jour­nal­ists from film­ing him. The visit to the hos­pi­tal, which of­fers the best can­cer treat­ment in the world, fu­elled spec­u­la­tion on Mu­gabe’s health although gov­ern­ment claimed he was only be­ing treated for an eye ail­ment. In the same month he trav­elled to South Africa where he at­tended South African Pres­i­dent Ja­cob Zuma’s in­au­gu­ra­tion after the ANC’s elec­toral tri­umph, be­fore fly­ing out to Dubai for a se­ries of di­a­mond meet­ings. In June, Mu­gabe headed for Bo­livia to at­tend the 50th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions of the G77 group of de­vel­op­ing na­tions that also in­cludes China. He also flew to the Equa­to­rial Guinea cap­i­tal, Malabo, to at­tend the 23rd or­di­nary ses­sion of the AU Hardly two months later, Mu­gabe left for a state visit to China on a trip highly pub­li­cised for the “mega in­vest­ment deals” signed that would bring re­lief to the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy, but so far the coun­try has not en­joyed any tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits from the agree­ments. On his way back, he stopped over in Sin­ga­pore for what was be­lieved to be yet another med­i­cal check-up. How­ever pres­i­den­tial spokesper­son George Charamba said the stop-over was merely for re-fu­elling pur­poses. Mu­gabe also took a large en­tourage to the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly in New York in Septem­ber. In Oc­to­ber, he left for Rome where he at­tended a beatification cer­e­mony for Pope Paul VI at the Vatican, while in Novem­ber he was in Vi­enna, Aus­tria, where he at­tended a con­fer­ence on land­locked de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. He also at­tended an Africa-Turkey sum­mit in Equa­to­rial Guinea dur­ing the same month. Mu­gabe and his wife were also at Pres­i­dent Michael Sata’s burial in Lusaka, Zam­bia, in Novem­ber. The Pres­i­dent and his fam­ily are cur­rently on a one-month state­funded hol­i­day in the Far East and are ex­pected back on Jan­uary 15. He is ac­com­pa­nied by not more than 10 aides who are paid hefty al­lowances to be at his ser­vice dur­ing his an­nual hol­i­days. The fig­ures paid to the aides can amount to over US$15 000 each. Money spent on his for­eign trips is far much more than what each eco­nomic min­istry gets for the year.By end of the year, Mu­gabe’s of­fice would have gob­bled close to US$40m in for­eign trips, ac­cord­ing to 2014 fig­ures, which makes the amounts al­lo­cated to eco­nomic min­istries such as In­dus­try and Com­merce, Mines, Small and Medium En­ter­prises (SMEs) and Tourism pale in com­par­i­son. The fig­ures drama­tise gov­ern­ment’s skewed pri­or­i­ties. . Up to Oc­to­ber 2014, Mu­gabe had spent US$1,23m on do­mes­tic trips alone in ad­di­tion to the US$32,6m. Ac­cord­ing to the blue book, the Min­istry of In­dus­try and Com­merce spent US$17,3m up to Oc­to­ber, while Mines spent just US$2,5m, SMEs (US$2,6m), Tourism (US$2m), En­ergy and Power De­vel­op­ment (US$1m) and Youth and In­di­geni­sa­tion (US$31,6m). For 2015, Chi­na­masa ap­pro­pri­ated US$190m for the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice, while In­dus­try and Com­merce is get­ting US$23m, Mines US$18,3m, Youth and In­di­geni­sa­tion US$43m, SMEs US$14,4m, En­ergy and Power De­vel­op­ment US$10m and Tourism US$3m. While eco­nomic min­istries — ex­cept Agri­cul­ture which re­ceived US$225m — se­cured pal­try bud­get al­lo­ca­tions, so­cial min­istries were bet­ter sup­ported. Health was al­lo­cated US$377m and Ed­u­ca­tion US$919m. Lands got US$14m, Trans­port US$289m, Wa­ter US$197m and Jus­tice US$123m. In ad­di­tion to an in­or­di­nate al­lo­ca­tion to the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice, se­cu­rity min­istries will gob­ble US$1bn of the 2015 bud­get. De­fence was al­lo­cated US$380m and Home Af­fairs US$485m. While Mu­gabe and his min­is­ters spent US$32,6m on for­eign jun­kets in 2014 up to Oc­to­ber and US$1,2 on do­mes­tic travel, Chi­na­masa dras­ti­cally re­duced the travel al­lo­ca­tion in 2015 to US$14,9m for for­eign travel and US$700 000 for do­mes­tic trips. The ad­min­is­tra­tive ex­pen­di­ture for the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice for 2015 has been set at US$173,9m, while state res­i­dences were al­lo­cated US$9 876 000. In the midst of the ex­trav­a­gance, Zim­babwe is bat­tling high un­em­ploy­ment es­ti­mated at over 80% and Chi­na­masa has been criss-cross­ing the globe in search of an elu­sive fi­nan­cial res­cue pack­age to kick­start the moribund econ­omy. As many as 400 work­ers are be­ing re­trenched on a weekly ba­sis as com­pa­nies con­tinue to close, while ser­vice de­liv­ery has de­te­ri­o­rated. Ac­cord­ing to sources at the Re­trench­ment Board, more than 6 020 work­ers have been re­trenched from Jan­uary to Novem­ber 2014. Zanu PF has come up with an eco­nomic blue­print, ZimAs­set, which re­quires about US$27 bil­lion to fully im­ple­ment be­tween 2013 and 2018, but gov­ern­ment has so far failed to mo­bilise the funds de­spite Mu­gabe and Chi­na­masa’s trips to China where they sought at least US$4bn in bud­getary support.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160815,PRO­TECT­ING ELE­PHANTS IS EV­ERY­ONE'S DUTY:,"RECOG­NISED by the UN, the World Ele­phant Day seeks to bring at­ten­tion and ac­tion to these threats and more, as the num­ber of ele­phants in Africa con­tinue to de­cline, fall­ing from 1,3 mil­lion in 1970 to just 475 000 in 2014, ac­cord­ing to the African Wildlife Foun­da­tion. Il­le­gal killings of the African ele­phant re­main the great­est threat. Sci­en­tists es­ti­mate over 30 000 ele­phants are killed each year for their ivory. Each tusk fetches as much as $15 000 on the street, and sev­eral times as much in China. In coun­tries like Zim­babwe, the ele­phant has a lot of eco­nomic value. Tro­phy hunt­ing rakes in mil­lions of dol­lars in earn­ings each year while the an­i­mal is a huge draw­card in the bil­lion-dol­lar-tourism in­dus­try. But the ele­phant is also a ma­jor worry here. At 80 000, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial es­ti­mates, the herd is twice as big the ac­tual num­ber of an­i­mals Zim­babwe’s re­serves and con­ser­van­cies can ac­com­mo­date. This has fanned deadly con­flicts with hu­mans, as ecosys­tems come un­der pres­sure from the over-pop­u­la­tion. Wildlife con­ser­va­tion­ists the world over are at pains try­ing to pro­tect this species, listed by the In­ter­na­tional Union for Con­ser­va­tion and Na­ture as “en­dan­gered.” The World Ele­phant Day rep­re­sents one of sev­eral strate­gies to raise aware­ness on the strate­gic im­por­tance of ele­phants not only in those African economies re­liant, in part, on wildlife tourism, but the en­tire world. CITES, the global watch­dog for en­dan­gered an­i­mal species, has gone as far as ban­ning all trade in ivory, as part of mea­sures to com­bat poach­ing - mea­sures cur­rently fac­ing fierce re­sis­tance from Zim­babwe, which is hold­ing 96 tonnes in un­sold ivory, and from much of SADC. Rev­enue from com­mer­cial ivory sales can help boost con­ser­va­tion work, they ar­gue. The US, one of Zim­babwe’s big­gest tourism source mar­kets, has an­nounced a near com­plete ban in ivory while China, the great­est con­sumer of ivory, is headed the same route. It is a real tug of war be­tween those coun­tries bur­dened with con­trol­ling ex­ces­sive pop­u­la­tions of this great beast, and those in the West, rich but with­out the daily ex­pe­ri­ence of liv­ing with the an­i­mal. Zim­babwe’s last com­mer­cial ivory sale oc­curred nearly a decade ago. A once-off sale of 3 700kg to Ja­pan and China on Novem­ber 1, 2008, gen­er­ated about $500 000, which was duly de­clared to the Con­ven­tion of In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species (CITES), ZimParks act­ing di­rec­tor gen­eral Mr Wil­son Mutin­hima told The Her­ald Busi­ness, by tele­phone, re­cently. Now, to mark the World Ele­phant Day, I spoke with Matthew Brown, Africa re­gion con­ser­va­tion di­rec­tor at US con­ser­va­tion or­gan­i­sa­tion, The Na­ture Con­ser­vancy, pick­ing his thoughts on ivory trade and other re­lated con­ser­va­tion is­sues. The Na­ture Con­ser­vancy has a pres­ence in sev­eral African coun­tries mon­i­tor­ing ele­phant pop­u­la­tions, help­ing gov­ern­ments to pro­vide bet­ter pro­tec- tion and habi­tat man­age­ment in key ele­phant ecosys­tems. Be­low is an ex­cerpt of the in­ter­view. I am rep­re­sented JG and Matthew Brown, MB. JG: Zim­babwe has been push­ing that in­ter­na­tional rules on ivory trade are re­laxed to al­low for coun­tries with huge stock­pile of ivory like it­self earn some­thing, which money would be chan­nelled into wildlife con­ser­va­tion. Do you be­lieve com­plete bans in ivory trade will tame poach­ing ef­fec­tively? And what should coun­tries like Zim­babwe do with their ex­ces­sive ivory in­ven­tory? MB: Bans in ivory trade will help all coun­tries on both the sup­ply and de­mand side of the prob­lem to put bet­ter sys­tems in place. To­day there is no way that a le­gal trade of ivory could work be­cause the im­mi­gra­tion ports and re­sellers and the wildlife de­part­ments do not have the abil­ity to dis­cern il­le­gal from ‘le­gal’ ivory. A ban is needed to con­trol the poach­ing and yes the hope is that this ac­tion will re­duce the il­le­gal trade. For now our per­spec­tive is that 1) we sup­port land­scape con­ser­va­tion — the loss of habi­tat is the big is­sue for ele­phants on the con­ti­nent and 2) we need to re­duce de­mand and 3) we sup­port mak­ing all sales il­le­gal at this time and see Pres­i­dent Xi (Jin Ping) and (Barack) Obama’s re­cent state­ments as ex­tremely en­cour­ag­ing. JG: Zim­babwe has one of the tough­est wildlife crime laws in Africa. The coun­try has a shoot-to-kill pol­icy for poach­ers. Those ar­rested for poach­ing face a manda­tory min­i­mum nine years in jail. But this has done lit­tle to end or min­imise poach­ing. What are the real is­sues driv­ing poach­ing in Africa, re­ally? With so much poverty across the con­ti­nent, can poach­ing be tamed, how? MB: While in­creas­ing penal­ties and hav­ing tough wildlife crime laws helps sig­nif­i­cantly, there is no ‘sin- gle’ an­swers. We need to re­duce the de­mand for ivory. We also need to in­crease the value that lo­cal peo­ple see in ele­phants via eco-tourism ben­e­fits, jobs, sup­port for ed­u­ca­tion, health care etc from ele­phants. We need for lo­cal peo­ple to see ele­phants worth more alive than dead. JG: For tra­di­tional rea­sons, many com­mu­ni­ties in Zim­babwe do not re­gard hunt­ing a crime. They ac­tu­ally see it as a right. How can gov­ern­ments bal­ance the need to pre­serve such tra­di­tional prac­tices where there is no crim­i­nal in­tent, with those sen­tences meted out on hard­core wildlife crim­i­nals? MB: I think this is a tough is­sue. If ele­phants are be­ing killed in re­tal­i­a­tion for raid­ing crops, then gov­ern­ments could look at in­vest­ing in some strate­gic fenc­ing or some crop pro­tec­tion mea­sures like ra­dio fre­quency col­lars on prob­lem­atic ele­phants, for ex­am­ple. But ideally there is a clear mes­sage that killing of ele­phants is a crime and that with the cur­rent cri­sis it is not ac­cept­able to kill, even for cul­tural rea­sons. JG: How can com­mu­ni­ties liv­ing in wildlife ar­eas ben­e­fit more from the pro­ceeds of the dif­fer­ent tourism ac­tiv­i­ties hap­pen­ing within their ar­eas? MB: Jobs is the high­est ranked ben­e­fit. But fund­ing for schools, clin­ics and in­creased se­cu­rity that goes with tourism are also ben­e­fits. Typ­i­cally, com­mu­ni­ties who are self-or­gan­ised (vil­lage or con­ser­vancy) and present a clear need and the abil­ity to work in part­ner­ship with tourism lodges will re­ceive greater ben­e­fit and be able to have their needs shared with the daily flow of for­eign tourists in their area. So proac­tive en­gage­ment, trans­par­ent com­mu­nity lead­er­ship and pre­sen­ta­tion of a clear plan are all some ex­am­ples of how com­mu­ni­ties can be per­haps see bet­ter gain from tourism.

zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20161009,Tak­ing a hard line on cor­rup­tion,"CAP­I­TAL­ISM has of­ten been as­so­ci­ated with greed and avarice as com­pa­nies, espe­cially big con­glom­er­ates, usu­ally stop at noth­ing to en­sure suc­cess. And suc­cess in busi­ness is de­fined as the abil­ity to make money. It is in such pur­suit for prof­its that the lines be­tween moral­ity and im­moral­ity, ethics and un­eth­i­cal be­hav­iour are blurred. In many cap­i­tal­ist so­ci­eties, bribery and extortion be­come the stock-in-trade for some busi­nesses. The ends (money) are al­ways used to jus­tify the means (bribery and extortion). While it is ac­cepted that bribery and extortion are crim­i­nal acts that the world has to con­tend with, it is the ten­dency to sani­tise and jus­tify the vices that is not. It would be grossly in­ac­cu­rate to con­sider bribes as only il­le­gal pay­ments that are made by one part to gain an ad­van­tage as they also in­clude gifts, dis­counts, free trips, spon­sor­ships, pro­mo­tions, and in­flated sales. Not only do they af­fect in­di­vid­u­als, but com­pa­nies and coun­tries as well. Ex­perts con­sider in­flated prices and pay­ments as one way bribes are paid by for­eign com­pa­nies to lo­cal in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies, while, on the con­versely, in­flated ex­ter­nal pay­ments are used as the con­duit to laun­der money. The eco­nomic im­pact of such il­licit trans­ac­tions is ob­vi­ously huge. But extortion in­volves ob­tain­ing items of value or ser­vices through the prac­tice of forc­ing an­other party to act in an in­vol­un­tary man­ner. So, the two co-ex­ist; in fact, they are Si­amese twins. A so­ci­ety where the vices are sub­tly ac­cepted as the norm espe­cially in busi­ness is bound to ex­pe­ri­ence in­creased in­ci­dences of cor­po­rate mis­gov­er­nance, in­clud­ing un­eth­i­cal busi­ness con­duct. Ger­man-based global civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tion Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional is of the opin­ion that no coun­try in the world is cor­rup­tion free. In essence, cor­rup­tion has be­come a tril­lion-dol­lar in­dus­try and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries are of­ten on the re­ceiv­ing end. Zim­babwe is ob­vi­ously a vic­tim. The Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s Of­fice has played a sig­nif­i­cant role in ex­pos­ing rot in state-con­trolled en­ti­ties and paras­tatals. Equally, there have also been sig­nif­i­cant rev­e­la­tions of scan­dals in the pri­vate sec­tor. De­tails are be­gin­ning to emerge of what was hap­pen­ing at Govern­ment-con­trolled mo­bile telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany, NetOne. Hard­line stance on graft But one of the ma­jor im­pacts of cor­rup­tion has been to in­flate the value of lo­cal projects. Where, for ex­am­ple, a project is sup­posed to be quoted US$7 mil­lion, it ends up be­ing com­pleted for US$27 mil­lion. This is the rea­son why due dili­gence and ex­ten­sive eval­u­a­tion of project costs are very nec­es­sary. Dif­fer­ent ju­ris­dic­tions treat such of­fences dif­fer­ently. In April this year, China’s Supreme Peo­ple’s Court and the Supreme Peo­ple’s Procu­ra­torate said cor­rup­tion in­volv­ing bribes and em­bez­zle­ment worth more than US$463 000 (three mil­lion yuan), which po­ten­tially have an “ex­tremely vile im­pact”, now at­tract the death penalty un­der the re­vised crim­i­nal law. Cases that are deemed “ex­tremely se­ri­ous” in­volv­ing amounts be­tween 1,5 mil­lion yuan and 3 mil­lion yuan can also at­tract the death sen­tence. Even though China’s 1997 crim­i­nal law im­poses the death penalty on crimes in­volv­ing amounts as low as 100 000 yuan, it has been im­ple­mented with dis­cre­tion. In fact, last year the num­ber of­fences that at­tract the death penalty were re­duced to 46. The new changes also ex­panded the def­i­ni­tion of bribery to also in­clude club mem­ber­ships, debt for­give­ness, paid trips and free home dec­o­ra­tion. China’s for­mer rail­ways min­is­ter Mr Liu Zhi­jun was given a sus­pended death sen­tence in 2013 for tak­ing a 60 mil­lion yuan bribe. It was, how­ever, later com­muted to life im­pris­on­ment in 2015. In ad­di­tion, for­mer top se­cu­rity of­fi­cial Mr Zhou Yongkang was jailed for life in June this year for bribes worth 129 mil­lion yuan. But in Zim­babwe it seems quite dif­fer­ent. Shady busi­ness­men as­sume rock star sta­tus overnight, and jus­tice is seem­ingly slow to visit them. Cor­rup­tion has been quite dam­ag­ing to the min­ing sec­tor. It is, there­fore, hardly sur­pris­ing that many com­pa­nies op­er­at­ing from off­shore ju­ris­dic­tions – largely viewed as havens for money laun­der­ing – have links to Zim­babwe’s min­ing sec­tor. What makes cor­rup­tion more po­tent is that of­fend­ers can al­ways pay them­selves out of scru­tiny and ar­rests. Per­pe­tra­tors are also usu­ally said to be pow­er­ful fig­ures whose stature and so­cial stand­ing is in­tim­i­dat­ing to in­ves­ti­ga­tors. In so­ci­eties where na­tional in­comes are be­low the poverty da­tum line, bribes and extortion thrive. The big­gest ques­tion of our time is how to stop all this rot. It is un­de­ni­able that the com­mit­ment nec­es­sar­ily has to start from the top. While the me­dia have tried to ex­pose cor­rup­tion, the onus is on statu­tory bod­ies and or­gan­i­sa­tions to in­ves­ti­gate those who might have been im­pli­cated. Com­pany board mem­bers and ex­ec­u­tives must al­ways ad­here to the tenets of good cor­po­rate gov­er­nance. En­force­ment of such cru­cial gov­er­nance codes does not have to hinge on mo­ral sua­sion; where of­fences hap­pen, they must be re­ported to the po­lice. Ex­pos­ing cor­rup­tion is fu­tile if al­le­ga­tions are not in­ves­ti­gated to their log­i­cal con­clu­sion. The im­port of non-ac­tion can be in­ter­preted as im­punity. The case of Eng­land’s for­mer na­tional team soccer man­ager Same Al­lardyce, who was fired 67 days into his term, is quite in­struc­tive. This is the def­i­ni­tion of de­ci­sive ac­tion. In Zim­babwe there is a ten­dency for shady com­pany ex­ec­u­tives, im­pli­cated in scan­dals in one com­pany, to be ap­pointed to se­nior posts in other com­pa­nies. They are even el­e­vated to join the board of di­rec­tors. Ef­fec­tive law en­force­ment in­volves pun­ish­ing of­fend­ers and breaking the cy­cle of im­punity. Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional claims that im­prov­ing fi­nan­cial man­age­ment and strength­en­ing the role of au­dit­ing agen­cies have in many coun­tries achieved greater im­pact than public sec­tor re­forms on curb­ing cor­rup­tion. Im­prov­ing on dis­clo­sure and trans­parency is also help­ful. Ev­ery or­gan­i­sa­tion han­dling public funds in Zim­babwe should dis­close their fi­nan­cial state­ments to the public. Ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion of­ten in­creases the re­spon­sive­ness of govern­ment bod­ies while si­mul­ta­ne­ously hav­ing a pos­i­tive ef­fect on the lev­els of public par­tic­i­pa­tion in a coun­try. Hold­ing Govern­ment to ac­count is a sus­tain­able ap­proach that helps to build mu­tual trust be­tween ci­ti­zens and Govern­ment. Cen­tral Govern­ment and lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are there to serve the public, and the gen­eral public also de­serve to know how their funds are be­ing used. Re­searchers have been able to prove that to a large ex­tent there is a di­rect cor­re­la­tion be­tween cor­rup­tion and un­der­de­vel­op­ment and there is need for Zim­bab­weans to recom­mit them­selves to the el­e­men­tary val­ues of ethics and in­tegrity.

Africa, it ap­pears, is never taken at the same level with re­gards to hu­mankind and the pro­gres­sion of world or­der in a global vil­lage that owes its ex­is­tence to the con­ti­nent’s hu­man and nat­u­ral re­sources. The plun­der and mu­ti­la­tion that Africa en­dured as a re­sult of slav­ery and coloni­sa­tion do not seem to ebb, since ef­forts to move on by lever­ag­ing on the con­ti­nent’s nat­u­ral re­sources are scut­tled at every turn through con­ven­tions that are mostly skewed against it. It is well that na­tions join hands to bol­ster col­lec­tiv­ity, a pre­cur­sor and pre­con­di­tion to pro­gres­sive out­comes, which is why the in­au­gu­ral Africa’s Wildlife Econ­omy Sum­mit held in Vic­to­ria Falls re­cently oozes hope to Zim­bab­weans and, in­deed, all African peo­ples look­ing for­ward to out­comes that will not only hinge on con­ser­va­tion, but those trans­lat­ing to eco­nomic ben­e­fits. Of­fi­cially open­ing the sum­mit, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa reaf­firmed Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to the Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) rules, but de­cried the one­size-fits all ap­proach that CITES ap­plies. Yes, be­ing sig­na­tory to or rat­i­fy­ing con­ven­tions may be pro­gres­sive, if the rea­sons for be­ing part to are known and shared ac­cord­ingly. But if the ten­dency to elitism and dic­ta­tor­ship re­mains an im­ped­i­ment to the progress of the so-called smaller mem­bers, then game rules save no other pur­pose than to im­pov­er­ish others while pur­port­ing to help them. Africa should speak with one voice when it comes to the is­sue of its re­sources, be­cause they are an in­her­i­tance which should ben­e­fit cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. Africa is en­dowed with vast nat­u­ral re­sources, among them wildlife, which should be used to bet­ter the life­styles of its cit­i­zens. Early this year, Zim­babwe, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa ap­plied to CITES, ap­peal­ing to have a ban on the com­mer­cial trade of their reg­is­tered stock­piles of ivory from the African ele­phant lifted. The same is­sue of stock­piles and the need to off­load them was raised again at the Vic Falls sum­mit, with Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa high­light­ing that Zim­babwe is sit­ting on US$600 mil­lion worth of reg­is­tered ivory that could go a long way in meet­ing con­ser­va­tion tar­gets and mit­i­gat­ing poverty in com­mu­ni­ties that have to bear the bur­den of co-ex­is­tence with wildlife. African ele­phants, black rhi­noc­eros and tigers are among en­dan­gered species said to be at risk of ex­tinc­tion if trade in ivory, horns and skins is not reg­u­lated, hence, CITES’s ban on in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial ivory trade in 1990. Although CITES ap­proved a one-off sale of 49,4 tonnes of stock­piled ivory from Botswana, Namibia and Zim­babwe to Ja­pan in 1999, and again in 2008 when 102 tonnes of ivory stock­piles where sold by the same coun­tries to Ja­pan and China, Zim­babwe alone has 70 tonnes of reg­is­tered stock­piles, while Botswana, Namibia and South Africa have 20 tonnes, 10 tonnes and 30 tonnes, re­spec­tively. Whereas CITES’s ar­gu­ment is that trade in ivory leads to poach­ing, hence, the de­ple­tion of the African ele­phant num­bers, a close anal­y­sis re­veals oth­er­wise. Fig­ures do not lie; and his­tory is the best teacher. It has to be high­lighted here, also, that Africa has a rich his­tory of con­ser­va­tion. There are two species of African ele­phants; the Lox­odonta Africana, the largest ele­phant species in the world, which thrives in the African Sa­van­nah and in the Sa­hel Desert in Mali, and the slightly smaller Lox­odonta cy­clo­tis found in the rain­forests of Cen­tral and West Africa. Re­searchers be­lieve that be­fore Euro­pean coloni­sa­tion Africa was home to 20 mil­lion ele­phants. Due to plun­der as­so­ci­ated with im­pe­ri­al­is­tic care­less­ness, by 1979, only 1,3 mil­lion ele­phants were left on the con­ti­nent. Be­tween 1979 and 1989, num­bers plum­meted to about 600 000. When na­tions or par­ties to CITES agreed to ban com­mer­cial trade on ivory in 1989, by plac­ing the African ele­phant on Ap­pen­dix I, there were around 600 000 of them. The ban has been in place for 30 years, yet the num­bers have come down to around 400 000. While there has been an over­all de­cline in num­bers, na­tions like Zim­babwe, Namibia, Botswana and South African have seen the num­bers of ele­phants soar­ing out of the coun­tries’ car­ry­ing ca­pac­i­ties. The four na­tions ac­count for 61 per­cent of the re­main­ing ele­phants on the con­ti­nent, yet they seem to be pun­ished for it. At around 130 000 ele­phants, Botswana has the largest num­ber of ele­phants in the world, fol­lowed by Zim­babwe at 84 000. Zim­babwe has a car­ry­ing ca­pac­ity of 50 000, mean­ing an ex­cess of more than 30 000. Ban­ning ivory trade, there­fore, is as atro­cious as it is in­sen­si­tive, not only to the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple, but to the same ele­phants that CITES, and other so called an­i­mal lovers pur­port to pro­tect. A ban cre­ates a gap for il­le­gal­ity. Poach­ers, who are part of well-knit and well-oiled syn­di­cates, know that there is a mar­ket for ivory, thus, they pounce and make a killing, while com­mu­ni­ties are im­pov­er­ished, maimed and killed, their crops de­stroyed and their live­stock de­voured as hu­man-wildlife con­flict in­ten­si­fies. Sim­i­larly, the ban on rhino horn trade had not saved the en­dan­gered an­i­mal. Poach­ing of the rhino has not stopped, more than 40 years af­ter the ban. It costs more than money to con­serve wildlife, and those that have de­stroyed their own ecosys­tems should not dic­tate terms to those, who, for cen­turies have man­aged to pre­serve theirs. Through totemic re­spect for an­i­mals as cul­tur­ally de­fined, Africans have man­aged to pre­serve their wildlife her­itage. Why should those with noth­ing, tell those with ex­cess num­bers what to do with their an­i­mals and stock­piles of their ivory, skins and horns? It is rather hyp­o­crit­i­cal and smacks of dou­ble stan­dards. Ele­phants suf­fer a worse fate in the West, and live like kings in the jun­gles of Africa, yet Africans are the ones to be pun­ished. Why? The United States of Amer­ica had no ele­phants, not even a sin­gle one, be­fore 1796. The first ele­phant to be brought to the US was a two-year-old fe­male, from In­dia, which ar­rived on April 13, 1796. There are be­tween 65 and 69 ele­phants owned by cir­cuses and trav­el­ling shows, where they are kept in chains or cages for 96 per­cent of the time. The ele­phants can travel up to 100 con­sec­u­tive hours in con­fined spa­ces. About 30 ele­phants are said to have died due to ill-treat­ment since 1992. In the Hwange Na­tional Park, for ex­am­ple, where more than 50 000 ele­phants roam the wild un­fet­tered, the car­ry­ing ca­pac­ity is 40 0000. And Hwange Na­tional Park, which is 14 651 km2, is half the size of Bel­gium, and there is no sin­gle river. The park re­lies on bore­hole wa­ter. Bore­hole wa­ter, which should be pumped for 53 949 ele­phants, and other wild an­i­mals on a daily ba­sis. An ele­phant needs about 150kg of food, and 190 litres of wa­ter per day, trans­lat­ing to 8 092 350kg of food and 10 250 310 litres of wa­ter. One can imag­ine the de­struc­tion that ele­phants can cause if they are to get in con­tact with hu­man habi­tats. The Zim­babwe Gov­ern­ment through its Parks and Wildlife Man­age­ment Author­ity (Zimparks) car­ries the bur­den of sus­tain­ing wildlife. And com­mu­ni­ties carry the same bur­den. If com­mu­ni­ties are to love an­i­mals and carry the mes­sage of con­ser­va­tion to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions; an­i­mals should be­gin to prove their worth to them. Al­ready the law does not al­low them to hunt with­out li­cences, which are way above their punch­ing weight. For­eign­ers can af­ford to hunt for tro­phies, lo­cals can­not af­ford to watch their liveli­hoods de­stroyed. Now, as if ban­ning trade in ivory were not enough, some quar­ters are even ad­vo­cat­ing burn­ing of stock­piles in show of sol­i­dar­ity with con­ser­va­tion calls. Ask­ing a com­mu­nity that has lost more than hope to burn reg­is­tered stock­piles of ivory to the tune of US$600 mil­lion is the worst form of ter­ror­ism. Of the 183 na­tions or par­ties to CITES, how many can re­ally be said to be do­ing enough to pre­serve the African her­itage epit­o­mised by the African ele­phant? Can they claim to be do­ing it more than the Africans, who have demon­strated their com­mit­ment through num­bers re­flected on the ground? Surely, ask­ing to be al­lowed to sell stock­piles, legally ac­quired, and not ap­peal­ing for ap­proval to kill ex­cess an­i­mals is hum­bling enough. Nat­u­ral re­sources are a peo­ple’s in­her­i­tance, and those who make game rules should be sen­si­tive to that. An in­her­i­tance should be ben­e­fi­cial and re­main her­i­ta­ble as a ter­ri­to­rial right, which is nei­ther ne­go­tiable nor trans­fer­able, for it is a birthright. Africa, there­fore, should speak with one voice, and refuse to be kow­towed into set­ting ablaze a whole peo­ple’s birthright.",津巴布韦
zw,The Manica Post,20180720,Macadamia: Chipinge's gold mine:,"THE re­cent tour of Chipinge by First Lady Aux­il­lia Mnan­gagwa was an eye opener for many who have al­ways rel­e­gated the dor­mant town to the dust­bins of poverty. A lot of peo­ple have al­ways con­sid­ered Chipinge to be the back of be­yond, as­so­ci­ated with drought and famine. They think noth­ing thrives in Chipinge. But they could not have been closer from the truth. The district is a gold mine, so to speak. It is a sleep­ing agri­cul­tural gi­ant that could be­come the big­gest for­eign cur­rency earner if prop­erly man­aged. It is home to some very suc­cess­ful farm­ers who have been pro­duc­ing crops for ex­port mar­kets bring­ing in the much needed for­eign cur­rency to the econ­omy. Crops that are cur­rently be­ing grown suc­cess­fully in Chipinge in­clude tea, cof­fee, ba­nanas and macadamia nuts. And the macadamia nuts be­ing grown by a num­ber of large-scale farm­ers in Chipinge did not es­cape the First Lady’s at­ten­tion. She toured one of the farms - Lu­pard’s Vlei Farm, af­ter she had com­pleted her visit to Mount Selinda hos­pi­tal and or­phan­age. The lit­tle known crop has be­come a cash cow for quite a num­ber of small­holder farm­ers too, some of whom grow as lit­tle as 20 trees and go on to reap quite hand­somely, al­beit a lit­tle later than most cash crops. Macadamia nut trees take five years to ma­ture and farm­ers can only start get­ting prof­its in the sixth year. But ac­cord­ing to Mr Dawie Jou­bert, one of the big­gest macadamia nuts pro­duc­ers in the district, the prof­its that come are worth the wait. “Most of our lo­cal farm­ers can earn a good in­come and live a de­cent life with only a few trees,” he says. He says one tree can yield up to 20kg of nuts at a time. And at $4 per kg, a farmer can earn be­tween $25 000 to $30 000 per hectare. An av­er­age Aus­tralian farmer has only five hectares of macadamia nut trees and this trans­lates to an av­er­age of $150 000 per yield. Now, you can imag­ine how much se­ri­ous farm­ers who have put macadamia nuts on large scale are earn­ing from the crop. Lu­pard’s Vlei farm has ap­prox­i­mately 100 000 trees and em­ploys more than 300 peo­ple on a monthly ba­sis and at least 30 ca­sual em­ploy­ees on a daily ba­sis. Their big­gest mar­ket is China and the Asian coun­try has the ca­pac­ity to take up so much more of the crop if more pro­duc­ers come on board. “Macadamia nuts are al­most as good a for­eign cur­rency earner as to­bacco but only health­ier,” he said. “The crop is also less chem­i­cal in­ten­sive hence it costs less to pro­duce than cof­fee, which most farm­ers in Chipinge have aban­doned in favour of macadamia.” How­ever, most lo­cal farm­ers are still grow­ing in the in­dus­try so they have only few trees. But that is not their big­gest chal­lenge. Just like with most cash crops, their big­gest threat is mid­dle­men who reap them off. “Most lo­cal farm­ers are los­ing out to out­siders who come and buy their crop off them at ridicu­lously low prices. They some­times get only half the price they should be get­ting,” said Mr Jou­bert. He says the farm­ers were sell­ing their crop at be­tween $1, 50 and $2 per kilo­gramme only while the buy­ers then go on to sell in China for a bet­ter price. But with a lot of in­ter­ac­tion with the big pro­duc­ers who have been ed­u­cat­ing them on ways to make profit from their crop, most small holder farm­ers could start earn­ing more from macadamia nuts. One such area of co­op­er­a­tion has been the grow­ing of nurs­eries to cut the cost of im­port­ing trees from South Africa. “We ben­e­fited from re­search done in South Africa and we have im­ported that knowl­edge here to es­tab­lish our own nurs­ery where we grow our own trees,” he said. We also sell the trees to other farm­ers in the area for $5 each. Most farm­ers have been im­port­ing the trees, which has sig­nif­i­cantly in­creased their costs even be­fore the crop is in the ground,” he said. He said the com­pany had been train­ing three other lo­cal farm­ers to es­tab­lish their own nurs­eries and sup­ply the lo­cal mar­ket. To fur­ther cut costs, Lu­pard’s Vlei farm has also con­structed a crack­ing plant for value ad­di­tion on the crop. The fac­tory, which of­fers the fi­nal step in the pro­duc­tion of the macadamia nuts, cracks open the hard shell cov­er­ing the nut to leave the fi­nal prod­uct, which is then sold to for­eign mar­kets. Not only will the crack­ing plant grow the macadamia nuts’ value chain, it will cre­ate more em­ploy­ment for the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion and fur­ther cut costs for the farmer. “South Africa used to make money from us be­cause we would take our dried nuts, still in their shells, there for crush­ing so we used to lose out. But this plant means we have cut SA out of our pro­duc­tion chain and we re­alise the full ben­e­fits,” he said. Mr Jou­bert said his hope was to value add for more lo­cal farm­ers to en­sure that all macadamia nuts that leave the coun­try have been cracked open to re­alise the best pos­si­ble prices. His also an­tic­i­pates the com­ing on board of more farm­ers to pro­duce macadamia nuts on a large scale and grow the in­dus­try to al­most the same size as the to­bacco in­dus­try, if not big­ger. “This is one com­mod­ity where we can have ef­fi­cient con­tract farm­ing schemes just like in to­bacco to en­sure that farm­ers can pro­duce ef­fi­ciently and ef­fec­tively.”",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20180412,Face­book CEO Zucker­berg grilled in US Congress,"MARK Zucker­berg, Face­book CEO, has ap­peared be­fore a US Congress com­mit­tee to an­swer ques­tions about the social media gi­ant’s poli­cies in the wake of a mas­sive data pri­vacy breach. Dur­ing a five-hour tes­ti­mony on Tues­day, the tech mogul said he was “sorry” about the Cam­bridge An­a­lyt­ica scan­dal, in which the pri­vate in­for­ma­tion of more than 87 mil­lion peo­ple was col­lected il­le­gally. He was also asked about the al­leged abuse of the social media plat­form by Rus­sian groups to in­ter­fere in the 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tions. The 33-year-old Face­book founder con­firmed his com­pany is “working with” a spe­cial coun­sel in­ves­ti­gat­ing the al­leged med­dling, while warn­ing of an “arms race” against Rus­sian ef­forts seek­ing to ex­ploit social media. In the high-stakes joint hear­ing of the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee and the Se­nate Com­mit­tee on Com­merce, Science and Trans­porta­tion, sev­eral Congress mem­bers voiced their dis­may over Face­book’s ac­tions or lack of ac­tion. Among the pos­si­ble out­comes of the tes­ti­mony are new rules on data pro­tec­tion that could limit Face­book’s abil­ity to make money. “Mark Zucker­berg spent the en­tire day in Washington, DC, pre­par­ing for this meet­ing and you could tell,” said Alan Fisher, re­port­ing from the US cap­i­tal. “He ditched his nor­mal grey T-shirt for a suit and it was a solid per­for­mance from the Face­book CEO.” Be­low are some of Zucker­berg’s quotes dur­ing, as well as some of his ex­changes with se­na­tors. Mark Zucker­burg (MZ): “We didn’t take a broad enough view of our re­spon­si­bil­ity, and that was a big mis­take. And it was my mis­take, and I’m sorry. I started Face­book, I run it, and I’m re­spon­si­ble for what hap­pens here.” “What we learned from that hear­ing is that the US Se­nate does not un­der­stand tech­nol­ogy very well. This is not new, but it is a crit­i­cal piece of in­for­ma­tion when you con­sider whether or not they are go­ing to try and reg­u­late this in­dus­try, that is on its own the third largest eco­nomic power in the world, be­hind the US and China, so that is a re­ally im­por­tant mo­ment. “What was re­ally shock­ing about to­day’s tes­ti­mony was that how ob­vi­ous it was. “If these se­na­tors walked into this room, fired up, ready to reg­u­late this com­pany, and they made it very clear that they didn’t know what they are talk­ing about, what do we end with? How do we deal with the next step? “It was very un­clear what the next steps are — the most clear thing that the Se­nate asked for was that they asked for Mark Zucker­burg’s own help craft­ing leg­is­la­tion to reg­u­late him­self. — AFP POPE Fran­cis is­sued a scathing re­buke of Catholics who pri­ori­tise some church laws and doc­trines —in­clud­ing those con­demn­ing abor­tion — over fight­ing for the poor and the op­pressed. In an apos­tolic ex­hor­ta­tion re­leased Mon­day, Fran­cis lamented that some Catholics think of pro­tect­ing many marginalised groups as a sec­ondary or su­per­fi­cial is­sue. The pon­tiff said that while ef­forts to re­strict abor­tion are cru­cial, it’s just as im­por­tant for mem­bers of his flock to fight for the rights of the “al­ready born.” “Our de­fence of the in­no­cent un­born, for ex­am­ple, needs to be clear, firm and pas­sion­ate,” Fran­cis wrote in his ex­hor­ta­tion. “Equally sa­cred, how­ever, are the lives of the poor, those al­ready born, the des­ti­tute, the aban­doned and the un­der­priv­i­leged, the vul­ner­a­ble in­firm and el­derly ex­posed to covert euthana­sia, the vic­tims of hu­man traf­fick­ing, new forms of slav­ery, and ev­ery form of re­jec­tion.” “We can­not up­hold an ideal of ho­li­ness that would ig­nore in­jus­tice in a world where some revel, spend with aban­don and live only for the lat­est con­sumer goods, even as oth­ers look on from afar, liv­ing their en­tire lives in ab­ject poverty,” the pope wrote. He added that he’s of­ten heard Catholics talk about the plight of mi­grants as a “lesser is­sue,” com­pared to cer­tain “bioeth­i­cal” con­cerns. In what looked like an ad­mon­ish­ment of anti-refugee sen­ti­ment among Chris­tians in Europe and the US, Fran­cis con­demned the idea that de­fend­ing mi­grants should be a sec­ondary con­cern. “That a politi­cian look­ing for votes might say such a thing is un­der­stand­able, but not a Chris­tian, for whom the only proper at­ti­tude is to stand in the shoes of those brothers and sis­ters of ours who risk their lives to of­fer a fu­ture to their chil­dren,” he wrote. “Can we not re­alise that this is ex­actly what Je­sus demands of us, when he tells us that in wel­com­ing the stranger we wel­come him?” he asked, point­ing to Matthew 25:35. — AFP",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20180429,In­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion key for Vi­sion 2030: ED,"THE 59th edi­tion of the Zim­babwe In­ter­na­tional Trade Fair (ZITF) that ended here yes­ter­day dove­tails with Govern­ment’s eco­nomic thrust to pri­ori­tise in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mod­erni­sa­tion as key as­pects to sus­tain­able eco­nomic growth. This was said by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa while of­fi­cially open­ing the highly sub­scribed fair on Fri­day. Govern­ment plans to turn around the econ­omy and turn Zim­babwe into a mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said the ZITF, which ran un­der the theme ‘Sus­tain­able In­dus­trial De­vel­op­ment: In­clu­sive-Com­pet­i­tive-Col­lab­o­ra­tive’, res­onated with Govern­ment’s eco­nomic thrust. “We are en­cour­aged by the over­whelm­ing re­sponse and sense of be­lief in this achiev­able vi­sion (2030),” said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. He said to achieve the vi­sion; there was need for the cre­ation of de­cent jobs, broad based em­pow­er­ment, in­creased in­vest­ments, elim­i­na­tion of poverty and cor­rup­tion. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa warned all Govern­ment of­fi­cials to de­sist from so­lic­it­ing bribes at ev­ery lev­els, par­tic­u­larly from in­vestors. Govern­ment is al­ready im­ple­ment­ing a raft of mea­sures to boost the vi­a­bil­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness of busi­ness across all sec­tors of the econ­omy. Chief among the mea­sures is the drive to elim­i­nate cost of do­ing busi­ness in the coun­try, which has pre­vi­ously kept in­vestors at bay. Crit­i­cally, Govern­ment has since amended the Indi­geni­sa­tion and Eco­nomic Em­pow­er­ment Act’s re­quire­ment that lo­cals should hold a 51 per­cent stake in all sec­tors of the econ­omy while for­eign­ers con­trol 49 per­cent. How­ever, the re­quire­ment —de­scribed by most in­vestors as toxic for a coun­try seek­ing to re-in­dus­tri­alise — has since been re­pealed for all other sec­tors apart from plat­inum and di­a­monds. But in­vestors eye­ing to set shop in plat­inum and di­a­mond ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and value ad­di­tion are still open to own­ing their busi­nesses 100 per­cent. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said his ad­min­is­tra­tion recog­nises the need for a com­pre­hen­sive ap­proach to at­tract­ing both do­mes­tic and for­eign in­vest­ment in the quest to cat­a­pult the econ­omy and be­come “one of the most in­dus­tri­alised economies in Africa”. “Hence, on the do­mes­tic front, mech­a­nisms are in place to sup­port the re­sus­ci­ta­tion, re­tool­ing, expansion and mod­erni­sa­tion of var­i­ous in­dus­tries through fis­cal and mone­tary in­cen­tives; the mo­bil­i­sa­tion of con­ces­sion­ary long- term fi­nanc­ing and con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ment of the busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment,” he said. “The do­mes­tic in­dus­try and busi­ness alike, should not be spec­ta­tors or mere com­men­ta­tors with re­gards to the cur­rent eco­nomic agenda, but should in­stead be in the fore­front of col­lab­o­rat­ing and part­ner­ing Govern­ment in ex­ploit­ing avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties.” As Govern­ment fo­cuses on grow­ing the econ­omy, it has iden­ti­fied pri­or­ity ar­eas such as agriculture, min­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing, tourism, in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, ICT and the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor. The sec­tors would be sup­ported by a rig­or­ous in­vest­ment pro­mo­tion drive through the re-en­gage­ment ef­forts to lure for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. This has seen Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa declar­ing that “Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness”. Al­ready, the coun­try has re­ceived over­whelm­ing re­sponse from po­ten­tial in­vestors who are en­quir­ing about in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. Firm in­vest­ment com­mit­ments have been made and ne­go­ti­a­tions are un­der­way to see them ma­te­ri­al­is­ing. ZIA alone has ap­proved in­vest­ment pro­pos­als of al­most US$1 bil­lion in the first quar­ter, which is a quan­tum leap from the US$150 mil­lion ap­provals recorded in the same pe­riod last year. Sta­tis­tics from ZIA ex­clude huge in­vest­ments such as Karo Re­sources’ US$4,2 bil­lion plat­inum deal. Fur­ther, a US$1,4 bil­lion Mata­bele­land North prov­ince lithium deal has been inked.

The des­ig­na­tion of SEZs is on-go­ing and will be both area and com­mod­ity based. Vic­to­ria Falls has been des­ig­nated as the tourism and fi­nan­cial SEZ and the Pres­i­dent’s re­cent State visit to China will see the ac­cel­er­a­tion its im­ple­men­ta­tion.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180123,Time to call eco­nomic sanc­tions what they are: War crimes,"THE first pa­thetic pieces of wreck­age from North Korean fish­ing boats known as “ghost ships” to be found this year are wash­ing up on the coast of north­ern Ja­pan. These are the storm-bat­tered re­mains of frag­ile wooden boats with un­re­li­able en­gines in which North Korean fish­er­men go far out to sea in the mid­dle of win­ter in a des­per­ate search for fish. Of­ten all that sur­vives is the shat­tered wooden hull of the boat cast up on the shore, but in some cases the Ja­panese find the bod­ies of fish­er­men who died of hunger and thirst as they drifted across the Sea of Ja­pan. Oc­ca­sion­ally, a few fam­ished sur­vivors are alive and ex­plain that their en­gine failed or they ran out of fuel or they were vic­tims of some other fa­tal mishap. The num­ber of “ghost ships” is ris­ing with no fewer than 104 found in 2017, which is more than in any pre­vi­ous year, though the real fig­ure must be higher be­cause many boats will have sunk with­out trace in the 600 miles of rough sea be­tween North Korea and Ja­pan. The rea­son so many fish­er­men risk and lose their lives is hunger in North Korea where fish is the cheap­est form of pro­tein. The govern­ment im­poses quo­tas for fish­er­men that force them to go far out to sea. Part of their catch is then sold on to China for cash, mak­ing fish one of the big­gest of North Korea’s few ex­port items. The fact that North Korean fish­er­men took greater risks and died in greater num­bers last year is ev­i­dence that in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions im­posed on North Korea are, in a cer­tain sense, a suc­cess: the coun­try is clearly un­der se­vere eco­nomic pres­sure. But, as with sanc­tions else­where in the world past and present, the pres­sure is not on the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who looks par­tic­u­larly plump and well-fed, but on the poor and the pow­er­less. The record of eco­nomic sanc­tions in forc­ing po­lit­i­cal change is dis­mal, but as a way of re­duc­ing a coun­try to poverty and mis­ery it is dif­fi­cult to beat. UN sanc­tions were im­posed against Iraq from 1990 un­til 2003. Sup­pos­edly, it was di­rected against Sad­dam Hus­sein and his regime, though it did noth­ing to dis­lodge or weaken them: on the con­trary, the Baathist po­lit­i­cal elite took ad­van­tage of the scarcity of var­i­ous items to en­rich them­selves by be­com­ing the sole sup­pli­ers. Sad­dam’s odi­ous el­der son Uday made vast prof­its by con­trol­ling the im­port of ci­garettes into Iraq. The bu­reau­crats in charge of UN sanc­tions in Iraq al­ways pre­tended that they pre­vented Sad­dam re­build­ing his mil­i­tary strength. This was al­ways a hyp­o­crit­i­cal lie: the Iraqi army did not fight for him in 1991, at the be­gin­ning of sanc­tions any more than it did when they ended. It was ab­surd to imag­ine that lead­ers like Kim Jong-un or Sad­dam Hus­sein would be in­flu­enced by the suf­fer­ings of their peo­ple. These are very real: I used to visit Iraqi hos­pi­tals in the 1990s where the oxy­gen had run out and there were no tyres for the am­bu­lances. Once, I was pur­sued across a field in Diyala prov­ince north of Bagh­dad by lo­cal farm­ers hold­ing up dusty X-rays of their chil­dren be­cause they thought I might be a visit­ing for­eign doc­tor. Sad­dam Hus­sein and his se­nior lieu­tenants were “rightly” ex­e­cuted for their crimes, but the for­eign politi­cians and of­fi­cials who were re­spon­si­ble for the sanc­tions regime that killed so many de­served to stand be­side them in the dock. It is time that the im­po­si­tion of eco­nomic sanc­tions should be seen as a war crime, since it in­volves the col­lec­tive pun­ish­ment of mil­lions of in­no­cent civil­ians who die, sicken or are re­duced to liv­ing off scraps from the garbage dumps. There is noth­ing very new in this. Eco­nomic sanc­tions are like a me­dieval siege, but with a mod­ern PR ap­pa­ra­tus at­tached to jus­tify what is be­ing done. A dif­fer­ence is that such sieges used to be di­rected at starv­ing out a sin­gle town or city while now they are aimed at squeez­ing whole coun­tries into sub­mis­sion. An at­trac­tion for politi­cians is that sanc­tions can be sold to the pub­lic, though of course not to peo­ple at the re­ceiv­ing end, as more hu­mane than mil­i­tary ac­tion. There is usu­ally a pre­tence that food­stuffs and med­i­cal equip­ment are be­ing al­lowed through freely and no men­tion is made of the fi­nan­cial and other reg­u­la­tory ob­sta­cles mak­ing it im­pos­si­ble to de­liver them. — Coun­ter­punch",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20151122,West keen to in­vest in Zim,"ZIM­BABWE will take ad­van­tage of the Western coun­tries’ soft stance on in­vest­ing in the coun­try by lin­ing up a num­ber of con­fer­ences and tours to tell the true Zim­bab­wean story amid in­di­ca­tions that the coun­tries are ea­ger to ex­plore lo­cal busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties. In an in­ter­view Macro-Eco­nomic Plan­ning and In­vest­ment Pro­mo­tion Min­is­ter Dr Obert Mpofu said from the en­gage­ment with some coun­tries in­clud­ing the Western ones, in­vestors had shown keen in­ter­est in in­vest­ing in the coun­try. Del­e­ga­tions from France and Bri­tain re­cently vis­ited the coun­try to ex­plore in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties and have shown in­ter­est in in­vest­ing in the coun­try. Dr Mpofu said Gov­ern­ment has also en­gaged Canada and Aus­tralia on in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the coun­try and their re­sponses have been pos­i­tive. He said the min­istry is or­gan­is­ing a num­ber of con­fer­ences and tours to spruce the im­age of the coun­try which is be­ing tainted by the lo­cal pri­vate and in­ter­na­tional me­dia. “We have lined up a lot of in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences to tell the Zim­bab­wean story on the econ­omy so that there won’t be any neg­a­tive per­cep­tions. The move is mainly de­signed to ap­peal to those who are against our poli­cies,” Dr Mpofu said. “We have al­ready em­barked on a de­lib­er­a­tive en­gage­ment process with other coun­tries to tell in­vestors what the coun­try can of­fer to them from a prac­ti­cal point of view as op­posed to wrong per­cep­tions that are mostly driven by hos­tile in­ter­na­tional me­dia and the pri­vate Press in the coun­try which seeks to dem­ine eco­nomic poli­cies. “There are some pos­i­tive devel­op­ments as the min­istry has made pos­i­tive strides to­wards en­cour­ag­ing in­vestors to lis­ten to us. We have Aus­tralians, Cana­di­ans, Chi­nese, Nige­ri­ans, Zam­bians and also South Africans promis­ing to come and in­vest in the coun­try. In the next few days we will be hav­ing a big del­e­ga­tion from China that will at­tract more about 2 000 com­pa­nies to de­lib­er­ate on is­sues of in­vest­ment.” The min­istry in part­ner­ship with African De­vel­op­ment Bank or­gan­ised a con­fer­ence that took place on Wed­nes­day and Thurs­day last week. The con­fer­ence was a high level sym­po­sium on in­clu­sive growth, in­vest­ment pro­mo­tion and poverty re­duc­tion. Dr Mpofu said the con­fer­ence came up with very im­por­tant is­sues which the min­istry is ad­dress­ing. He said in­vestors raised con­cerns which were cru­cial in cre­at­ing a suit­able en­vi­ron­ment for peo­ple to in­vest in the coun­try and the Gov­ern­ment will leave no stone un­turned in solv­ing is­sues raised. Dr Mpofu added that his min­istry was work­ing hard to en­sure that for­eign direct in­vest­ment im­proves. He said the man­date which he has is to en­sure that in­vestors don’t face chal­lenges or bu­reau­cratic con­di­tions when they want to in­vest. Said Dr Mpofu: “As the min­istry we have the duty to en­hance the at­trac­tion of more for­eign direct in­vest­ment in a man­ner that makes it easy and at­trac­tive for in­vestors to in­vest in the coun­try. We are work­ing hard to en­sure that it be­comes easy for in­vestors to process their pa­per work eas­ily not un­der bu­reau­cratic chal­lenges that some in­vestors are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing or used to ex­pe­ri­ence. Zim­babwe is ranked poorly in the in­vest­ment in­dex and this is one of the is­sues that the min­istry will look into and solve through work­shops, con­fer­ences and also vis­it­ing per­form­ing coun­tries to learn from them.” Al­though Zim­babwe’s for­eign direct in­vest­ment (FDI) flows have been on a steady up­ward trend, the coun­try still lags be­hind its coun­ter­parts in the re­gion. In 2013, Zim­babwe’s FDI amounted to $400 mil­lion, which in­creased to $545 mil­lion last year, lat­est fig­ures from the United Na­tions Con­fer­ence on Trade and De­vel­op­ment (UNCTAD) show. In com­par­i­son, last year neigh­bours South Africa, Mozam­bique and Zam­bia recorded FDI in­flows of $5,7 bil­lion, $4,9 bil­lion and $2,4 bil­lion re­spec­tively.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190814,Re­tool­ing NYS to drive eco­nomic growth,"ON Au­gust 12 Zim­babwe com­mem­o­rated the gallant sons and daugh­ters who sac­ri­ficed their lives for the free­dom of the coun­try. Glob­ally, the day is also the In­ter­na­tional Youth Day and serves as an an­nual cel­e­bra­tion of the role of young women and men as es­sen­tial part­ners in change, and also an op­por­tu­nity to raise aware­ness of chal­lenges and prob­lems fac­ing the world’s youth. Along with recog­nis­ing ef­forts of the world’s youth in en­hanc­ing global so­ci­ety, it also aims to pro­mote ways to en­gage them in be­com­ing more ac­tively in­volved in mak­ing pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tions to their com­mu­ni­ties. This year’s theme is “Trans­form­ing ed­u­ca­tion”, high­light­ing ef­forts to make ed­u­ca­tion more in­clu­sive and ac­ces­si­ble for all youth. The Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment prom­ises to “en­sure in­clu­sive and eq­ui­table qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion and pro­mote life­long learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for all.” It thus be­comes im­per­a­tive for the coun­try to re­vive the Na­tional Youth Ser­vice (NYS), whose man­date of youth de­vel­op­ment is not unique to Zim­babwe, but is in line with in­ter­na­tional, con­ti­nen­tal, re­gional and do­mes­tic poli­cies and pro­vi­sions such as the African Youth Char­ter, the South­ern Africa De­vel­op­ment Com­mu­nity Youth De­vel­op­ment Frame­work, the Con­sti­tu­tion of Zim­babwe, the Na­tional Youth Pol­icy, and the Vi­sion 2030. With­out di­lut­ing the fo­cus on na­tional in­te­gra­tion, new di­rec­tions should be sought for the NYS to pre­pare mem­bers for en­trepreneur­ship and future lead­er­ship. Bet­ter align­ment of skills and learn­ing un­der the scheme to na­tional pri­or­i­ties is ap­pro­pri­ate. NYS should work more de­lib­er­ately to in­spire en­trepreneur­ship and job cre­ation through the scheme. En­tre­pre­neur­ial train­ing should be main­streamed into all NYS ac­tiv­i­ties in part­ner­ship with the pri­vate sec­tor and rel­e­vant State agen­cies such as Min­istry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recre­ation. In col­lab­o­ra­tion with the NYS, host or­gan­i­sa­tions, agen­cies and com­mu­ni­ties should also be com­pelled to de­velop work­plans which clearly spell out the goals for mem­bers to en­sure that learn­ing po­ten­tials are max­imised. Gov­ern­ment, pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions and other rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers must closely en­gage to de­fine op­ti­mal cri­te­ria and strate­gies for de­ploy­ment of corps into var­i­ous sec­tors of na­tional life. A key pri­or­ity should be the in­su­la­tion of de­ploy­ment from rig­ging and in­flu­ence. Zanu-PF Sec­re­tary for Youth Af­fairs Cde Pupu­rai Tog­a­repi re­cently im­plored youths to fo­cus on re­build­ing the econ­omy through en­trepreneur­ship and de­sist from all forms of vi­o­lence. He said his visit to China would see Chi­nese youths from the Chi­nese Communist Party (CCP) come into the coun­try to im­part en­trepreneur­ship skills. “Zanu-PF’s main agenda is to in­vest in youths as they are the lead­ers of to­mor­row. You should be cham­pi­ons in var­i­ous en­trepreneur­ship skills so that our econ­omy will im­prove in ac­cor­dance with our Pres­i­dent’s vi­sion of be­com­ing an up­per mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030,” said Cde Tog­a­repi dur­ing a youth in­ter-dis­trict out­reach in Mashona­land Cen­tral. “You (youths) are the ones re­spon­si­ble for re­build­ing the econ­omy. My visit to China was very cru­cial be­cause very soon, there is go­ing to be a team of ex­perts in en­trepreneur­ship who will teach our youths on self-suf­fi­ciency and be­come skilled in var­i­ous ar­eas, be it sewing, bak­ing, and many more ideas.” True to Cde Tog­a­repi’s sen­ti­ments, the NYS can be used to in­stil pa­tri­o­tism among the youths and give them have the zeal to de­velop the na­tion will­ingly and self­lessly. The pro­gramme, which was sus­pended in 2009 due to financial con­straints, should be fi­nanced as it is cru­cial if the coun­try is to achieve its goal of be­com­ing an up­per mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030. Lessons can be drawn from other African coun­tries that have adopted the NYS and with clear set tar­gets which are bear­ing pos­i­tive re­sults in those coun­tries. For ex­am­ple, Nige­ria is among the 106 or so coun­tries with no en­forced con­scrip­tion into its mil­i­tary. How­ever, it has a manda­tory civil­ian ser­vice for its fresh grad­u­ates who are less than 30 years of age as at the time of grad­u­a­tion and have not served or are ac­tively serv­ing in any state-run se­cu­rity or­gan­i­sa­tion. Sev­eral coun­tries have the vari­ants of the manda­tory na­tional ser­vice, with the ob­jec­tives de­pend­ing on the na­tional con­text and needs. Nige­ria, Kenya and Ghana are prom­i­nent African coun­tries with es­tab­lished NYS schemes. Sev­eral other West­ern na­tions also have the com­pul­sory civil­ian ser­vice. Ser­vi­cio So­cial in Mex­ico is a re­quired com­mu­nity ser­vice pro­gramme for all Mex­i­can uni­ver­sity stu­dents. Stu­dents must serve 480 hours of vol­un­tary ac­tiv­ity over the course of a four-year un­der­grad­u­ate ed­u­ca­tion. The goal is to build sol­i­dar­ity among youths and in­crease col­lab­o­ra­tion in com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment. The Na­tional Youth Com­mis­sion in South Africa is a na­tional youth ser­vice pro­gramme and gov­ern­ment-spon­sored na­tional youth ser­vice pro­gramme that en­lists youth in com­bat­ing the spread of HIV/AIDS and in re­duc­ing youth un­em­ploy­ment. Ser­vi­cio País in Chile is a com­pet­i­tive se­lec­tion civil ser­vice pro­gramme for uni­ver­sity grad­u­ates with the goal of de­creas­ing ru­ral poverty. Se­lect pro­fes­sions are re­cruited to the pro­gramme such as lawyers, en­gi­neers, and med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als. If cho­sen, grad­u­ates serve 13 months in a ru­ral area. They prac­tise their pro­fes­sions and also build re­la­tion­ships with lo­cal peo­ple. Typ­i­cally, the manda­tory civil­ian schemes fo­cus on im­prov­ing in­ter­nal se­cu­rity, na­tion-build­ing and dis­as­ter re­sponse as in the case of Kenya. Newly qual­i­fied grad­u­ates in Ghana and Nige­ria are given the op­por­tu­nity to have prac­ti­cal ex­po­sure on the job, both in the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors, as part of their civic re­spon­si­bil­ity to the state. This pro­vides host or­gan­i­sa­tions the op­por­tu­nity to sat­isfy their man­power needs. Like­wise, it af­fords com­mu­ni­ties that would other­wise have dif­fi­culty in ac­cess­ing main­stream de­vel­op­ment ini­tia­tives a chance to ac­cess im­proved so­cial ser­vices through youth ser­vice to the com­mu­nity. Whilst it may be costly for the coun­try to fully re­vive the NYS given the pre­vail­ing eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion, a thor­ough re­assess­ment is nec­es­sary with a view to repo­si­tion­ing and mak­ing it more rel­e­vant to Zim­babwe’s pre­vail­ing cir­cum­stances. Go­ing for­ward, the thrust of the NYS should pre­pare the coun­try’s youths for future lead­er­ship and align their ori­en­ta­tion and skills to na­tional pri­or­i­ties. In other coun­tries with sim­i­lar schemes, there is strong col­lab­o­ra­tion with the host or­gan­i­sa­tions and ben­e­fit­ing com­mu­ni­ties which Zim­babwe should em­u­late. Pro­po­nents of NYS across the globe also sug­gest that with the pre­vail­ing chal­lenges fac­ing coun­tries such as in­se­cu­rity of life, prop­er­ties and food short­ages, per­haps it might even be op­ti­mal to have a two-year na­tional ser­vice. One of those years could be de­voted to para­mil­i­tary train­ing. This would en­sure that the na­tion has a pool of trained re­servists to sup­ple­ment ex­ist­ing ca­pac­i­ties for emer­gency re­sponse. The mil­i­tary would have to be re­struc­tured to su­per­vise this. The sec­ond year would then fo­cus on main­stream­ing the NYS mem­bers into spe­cialised skills in sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, ed­u­ca­tion, health, com­mu­ni­ca­tions and lead­er­ship among other key ar­eas. Dur­ing this pe­riod some could be matched to job va­can­cies whilst oth­ers could be en­cour­aged to start-up busi­nesses as in­di­vid­u­als or in groups. There­fore, the NYS pro­gramme in the coun­try should be re­struc­tured to of­fer a seam­less tran­si­tion from the world of struc­tured learn­ing to the world of work. It should be­come the ma­jor shift which all ed­u­cated young Zim­bab­weans are given the vi­sion to first en­counter and ap­pre­ci­ate for­mal work while of­fer­ing them a chance for na­tional ser­vice. Ad­di­tion­ally, the pro­gramme should be struc­tured in a way that of­fers all grad­u­ates clearer guid­ance to en­able them re­flect in­tel­li­gently on their ca­reer op­tions. Also crit­i­cal when re­viv­ing the scheme is to in­clude all youths in­clud­ing young ar­ti­sans who have as­sim­i­lated vo­ca­tional skills in agri­cul­ture, car­pen­try, fash­ion, hos­pi­tal­ity, met­al­work, beauty ther­apy and even en­ter­tain­ment. ◆ Read the full ar­ti­cle on www.her­ald. co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20160925,So­lar panel prices fall 80 per­cent,"RAED KHADER, a Jor­da­nian driver, thumbs his mo­bile phone. Af­ter scrolling back through al­most two years of pho­tos, he finds a picture that tick­les him - of camels against a sandy back­drop. TO­DAY that same spot out­side Ma’an, a poverty-stricken city in south Jor­dan, is crawl­ing with work­ers in the fi­nal stages of in­stalling five square kilo­me­tres of so­lar pan­els. He is en­rap­tured by the pho­to­voltaic (PV) mod­ules that shim­mer in the desert sun­shine. “It’s amazing. I love it. It’s good to see my coun­try de­velop its own source of en­ergy,” he says. “We have such good sun here. It’s free. Why don’t we use more of it?” In his en­thu­si­asm, he has con­vinced his daugh­ter to be­come one of the first Jor­da­nian women to study for a so­lar-en­ergy en­gi­neer­ing de­gree. The 160-megawatt (MW) so­lar park, which is sched­uled to open this sum­mer, will mark the launch of Jor­dan’s ef­fort to re­duce its fos­sil-fuel im­ports, which gen­er­ated 96 per­cent of its en­ergy last year and cost about 10 per­cent of GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct). In a restive neigh­bour­hood, it has good rea­son to be­come more self-re­liant. Its lik­ing for so­lar in­ten­si­fied af­ter Egypt tem­po­rar­ily cut nat­u­ral-gas sup­plies dur­ing the Arab spring in 2011. The small steps sanc­tioned by Jor­dan’s cau­tious bu­reau­cracy pale in com­par­i­son with the growth of so­lar en­ergy in some other coun­tries. But they il­lus­trate the al­lure of the tech­nol­ogy, as well as some of its teething prob­lems. Across the de­vel­op­ing world, so­lar power is hit­ting its stride. Rather than the rooftop pan­els pop­u­lar in Ger­many, coun­tries where so­lar ir­ra­di­ance is much stronger than north­ern Europe are cre­at­ing vast parks with tens of thou­sands of flex­i­ble PV pan­els sup­ply­ing power to their na­tional grids. Some coun­tries, such as China, pro­vide gen­er­ous sub­si­dies (though these are some­times years over­due). But in other coun­tries so­lar PV is be­com­ing com­pet­i­tive even with­out fi­nan­cial sup­port. In 2015 China surged past Ger­many to be­come the big­gest pro­ducer of so­lar en­ergy, ben­e­fit­ing from its dom­i­nance of so­lar-panel man­u­fac­tur­ing and poli­cies to re­duce de­pen­dence on dirt­ier fu­els, such as coal. So­lar power ac­counts for just 3 per­cent of the elec­tric­ity mix, but China is now build­ing its big­gest plant, in the Gobi desert. An­a­lysts ex­pect the coun­try to in­stall 12 gi­gawatts (GW) of so­lar in the first half of this year. That would be one-third more than the record amount Amer­ica plans to build for the full year. Coal, mean­while, is in grow­ing trou­ble. India is de­ter­mined to keep up. Its gov­ern­ment is tar­get­ing a 20-fold in­crease in so­lar-power ca­pac­ity by 2022, to 100GW. Though this might be over-am­bi­tious, KPMG, a con­sul­tancy, ex­pects so­lar’s share of India’s en­ergy mix to rise to 12,5 per­cent by 2025, from less than 1 per­cent to­day. It thinks so­lar in India will be cheaper than coal by 2020. (Even Coal India, a mostly state-owned en­tity, plans to con- tract 1GW of so­lar power to cut en­ergy bills.) Such is the frenzy that of­fi­cials in sunny Pun­jab are urg­ing farm­ers to lease their land to so­lar de­vel­op­ers rather than till it. Led by big projects in these two coun­tries, global so­lar-en­ergy ca­pac­ity rose by 26 per­cent last year. More re­mark­able is the de­cline in its cost. Stud­ies of the “lev­elised cost” of elec­tric­ity, which es­ti­mate the net present value of the costs of a gen­er­at­ing sys­tem di­vided by the ex­pected out­put over its life­time, show so­lar get­ting close to gas and coal as an at­trac­tively cheap source of power. Auc­tions of long-term con­tracts to pur­chase so­lar power in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries such as South Africa, the United Arab Emi­rates, Peru and Mex­ico pro­vide real-world ev­i­dence that such as­sump­tions may even prove to be con­ser­va­tive (see chart). In sunny places so­lar power is now “shoul­der to shoul­der” with gas, coal and wind, says Cé­dric Philib­ert of the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency, a prominent fore­caster. He notes that since Novem­ber 2014, when Dubai awarded a project to build 200MW of so­lar power at less than $60 a megawatt hour (MWh), auc­tions have be­come in­creas­ingly com­pet­i­tive. Some re­new­able-en­ergy de­vel­op­ers are gain­ing global rep­u­ta­tions as record-break­ers. The Dubai bid was won by Acwa Power, a Saudi com­pany that is tak­ing big strides across the Mid­dle East and Africa, de­spite the oil-rich king­dom’s own half­hearted plans for so­lar de­vel­op­ment. In Morocco it has built the first phase of the world’s largest so­lar-ther­mal plant, which is us­ing mir­rors to gen­er­ate heat to drive elec­tric­ity tur­bines. Moody’s, a rat­ing agency, says the com­pleted plant will cut Morocco’s oil-im­port bills by 0,3 per­cent of GDP. Let the sun­shine in Italy’s Enel Green Power (EGP) is also at­tract­ing at­ten­tion. In Fe­bru­ary it won a ten­der to pro­vide Peru with 20 years of power from so­lar PV at just un­der $48 a MWh. Just over a month later Mex­ico awarded it a sim­i­larly lengthy con­tract to gen­er­ate so­lar power in the arid north­ern state of Coahuila at a price of about $40 per MWh. Bloomberg New En­ergy Finance (BNEF), a re­search firm, called it “the low­est sub­sidy-free so­lar con­tract we have ever seen”. EGP’s head of busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, An­to­nio Cam­mise­cra, says there is a clear trend of fall­ing prices. “We are try­ing to drive it,” he says. The main fac­tor be­hind the price drop is an 80 per­cent fall in the cost of so­lar pan­els since 2010, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Re­new­able En­ergy Agency, an in­dus­try body. But Mr Cam­mise­cra says that may now be close to end­ing. He trav­elled to China this week to per­suade panel man­u­fac­tur­ers to in­vest more in tech­no­log­i­cal im­prove­ments, in or­der to in­crease the amount of so­lar en­ergy that can be con­verted into elec­tric­ity. An­a­lysts are also con­cerned that some providers’ auc­tion bids may be over-ag­gres­sive, though com­pa­nies can in­cur stiff penal­ties if they fail to com­plete a con­tract. Mr Philib­ert notes that some con­tracts may col­lapse be­cause bid­ders are un­able to raise finance. Jenny Chase of BNEF says that in some cases “the model is be­ing pushed to the ab­so­lute limit”. In­dian firms, for ex­am­ple, are cal­cu­lat­ing de­vel­op­ment costs well be­low com­pa­ra­ble global bench­marks. “I strug­gle to see how they will do this with­out cut­ting cor­ners,” she says. Jor­dan is a case in point. A Greek de­vel­oper, Sun­rise, last year agreed to charge $61 per MWh to build a 50MW so­lar plant north of Amman, which rival de­vel­op­ers thought too cheap be­cause of rel­a­tively high fi­nanc­ing costs in Jor­dan. Last month Acwa Power bought the Jor­da­nian unit in or­der to res­cue the con­tract. An­a­lysts say it is hard to see how Acwa will make money from it, but the ges­ture may help it win so­lar con­tracts in the fu­ture. The king­dom of­fers more lessons on po­ten­tial pit­falls. Like many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, its na­tional elec­tric­ity com­pany, NEPCO, has failed to ex­pand its grid as quickly as pri­vate firms can erect so­lar parks, though it now has fund­ing to build high-volt­age trans­mis­sion lines to con­nect the so­lar plants to Amman, the cap­i­tal, where most elec­tric­ity is con­sumed. (This prob­lem is shared with China, which some­times forces so­lar and wind plants to “cur­tail” their elec­tric­ity out­put be­cause the grid lacks the ca­pac­ity to ab­sorb it.) But Jor­dan is blessed with ge­o­graph­i­cal fea­tures that will let it ex­pand its so­lar ca­pac­ity once it has ironed out its prob­lems. Engi­neers say that the area around Ma’an, with about 330 sunny days a year, has some of the best so­lar ir­ra­di­ance in the re­gion. They add that, be­cause of its al­ti­tude and ter­rain, heat and dust do not sub­stan­tially lower the ef­fi­ciency of the PV pan­els, as they do in neigh­bour­ing Saudi Ara­bia. Sup­port also comes from the top. King Ab­dul­lah has or­dered so­lar pan­els to be in­stalled on palaces and mosques, busi­ness­men say. His most se­nior min­is­ters drive Tesla elec­tric ve­hi­cles. With more so­lar en­ergy, the eco­nomic fu­ture of Jor­dan would be brighter and the coun­try less at risk in a volatile re­gion. All it needs is for the sun to en­er­gise its bu­reau­crats. - Econ­o­mist.",津巴布韦

He just can’t seem to get it right. He told an au­di­ence re­cently that the next time he saw them he hoped they wouldn’t be so poor. Of­fi­cially open­ing the 58th edi­tion of the Mata­bele­land South Agri­cul­tural Show in Gwanda, Vice-Pres­i­dent Phelekezela Mphoko said they were aware that peo­ple in re­set­tle­ment ar­eas were giv­ing them­selves lead­er­ship po­si­tions af­ter which they go on to sell land to des­per­ate in­di­vid­u­als. The VP called on the peo­ple of Mata­bele­land South to ef­fec­tively use re­sources in their province, say­ing that it was a known fact that it had the po­ten­tial of be­com­ing the wealth­i­est province in the coun­try. “This province has be­tween 500 000 and 600 000 peo­ple. It is a province that borders two of the coun­try’s neigh­bours — South Africa and Botswana — you must use this strength to en­sure that you make this cor­ri­dor grow,” he said. “You have the rich­est grass in the whole coun­try which is good for cat­tle ranch­ing. Fur­ther, you have gold in this province which is 85% pure. “All these are just some of the at­tributes that you have as a province. What is im­por­tant now is that you don’t al­low peo­ple who are not from here to come and take away all these re­sources from you. Use them, they are all yours,” said the VP. He said the province should also utilise ir­ri­ga­tion schemes so that they be­came self-suf­fi­cient. Ns Bur­dened IN his ar­ti­cle pub­lished by this pa­per last week; “De­crepit Mu­gabe plunges Zim into poverty”, Graham Boyn­ton sum­marised in depth the tri­als and tribu­la­tions blud­geon­ing the coun­try’s cit­i­zens in their quest for eman­ci­pa­tion from neo-colo­nial bondage.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161003,Ivory pro­po­nents hard done at Cites:,"WITH a 96-tonne ivory stock­pile, Harare was hop­ing to force through the adop­tion of the De­ci­sion Mak­ing Mech­a­nism (DMM), which would al­low trade in ivory in fu­ture. The plan fell through af­ter only 20 mem­bers of the Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species (Cites) voted in favour, and 76 against the mech­a­nism — in dis­pute for nine years. Now, fears are that fur­ther pro­pos­als by Zim­babwe and Namibia for a once-off sale will also face re­sis­tance, and pos­si­bly re­jec­tion, when they are pre­sented at the meet­ing this week. But the de­ci­sion by some 29 African coun­tries, sup­ported by the West and wildlife campaigners, to com­pletely avoid trade in ivory could not have been more flawed. In a re­port, Cites has dis­missed claims that the spike in the il­le­gal killing of African ele­phant re­sulted di­rectly from the last le­git­i­mate sale of ivory in 2008. The claims were made by the Na­tional Bu­reau of Eco­nomic Re­search (NBER), a US non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion. It is in­struc­tive that Cites, which has car­ried out in­ten­sive mon­i­tor­ing and con­ser­va­tion of the an­i­mal in sev­eral African coun­tries, in­clud­ing Zim­babwe, since 2000, found the NBER re­search short on merit. Fur­ther, the dis­puted re­search is com­ing from the US, a coun­try averse to any form of trade in ivory. It is not clear how much in­flu­ence the US au­thor­i­ties could have had in the mak­ing of the NBER re­port. But it’s also un­de­ni­able that the fi­nal out­come gen­er­ally re­flects the US’ in­ter­ests and po­si­tion, pre­sented to the world as in­de­pen­dent re­search. Doubt­less, the Na­tional Bu­reau of Eco­nomic Re­search re­port may have been de­signed to in­flu­ence ne­go­ti­a­tions at the Cites meet­ing to­wards an out­come that stops gen­uine ivory am­bi­tions by coun­tries like Zim­babwe in their tracks. And it has worked, with strong sup­port from African coun­tries like Kenya, Burk­ina Faso, Chad and the Repub­lic of Congo, which are los­ing ele­phants to poach­ing in huge num­bers, mainly due to poor con­ser­va­tion, weak pol­icy and poverty. What’s clear, how­ever, is that there are no le­git­i­mate grounds for shoot­ing down pro­pos­als by Zim­babwe, Namibia and South Africa to trade in ivory to help build com­mu­ni­ties that live with ele­phants ev­ery­day of their lives. Science has failed to prove that there is a di­rect link be­tween legal ivory sales and the in­crease in poach­ing. Since the 2008 one-off sale, the num­ber of ele­phants hunted il­le­gally in Africa has been volatile, climb­ing to 25 000 in 2013 from 11 000 in 2007, be­fore drop­ping to 20 000 last year, Cites data show. And nei­ther has science demon­strated that com­plete bans will com­bat poach­ing. For 40 years, the Cites has banned trade in the rhino horn, but that has not stopped il­le­gal killings. About 25 per­cent of the re­main­ing 20 000 white rhino in the wild have been killed in the last decade, spurred on by firm de­mand in China and Viet­nam. High de­mand The de­mand for ele­phant tusks con­tin­ues to flour­ish, too. Now, the laws of eco­nom­ics on sup­ply and de­mand are pretty clear — where there is a mar­ket, sup­ply will fol­low. Ivory is sim­ply fol­low­ing its ac­tive buy­ers from Asia — who are will­ing to pay tens of thou­sands of dol­lars for a sin­gle tusk — al­beit il­le­gally. It is a huge cri­sis, more so in view of the big bucks flow­ing into il­le­gal wildlife trade each year — about $20 bil­lion, Cites says. But if il­le­gal sales are truly a cri­sis, why not just make the trade le­git? Could the Jo­han­nes­burg Cites con­fer­ence have missed an op­por­tu­nity to bring or­der, trans­parency and le­gal­ity to the trade in ivory sim­ply on ac­count of emo­tion from those African coun­tries fail­ing to ef­fec­tively man­age their wildlife — and those from the West whose ele­phants ex­ists only in zoos? Could the lack of fi­nal­ity on ivory lead to a split within the Cites, with south­ern Africa — host to the world’s largest ele­phant herd — on the one hand and the rest of the world on the other, deep­en­ing a cri­sis that al­ready has sev­eral par­ties on ten­ter­hooks? For there is no jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the con­tin­ued stand­off in ivory sales. It may very well be what Environment Min­is­ter Op­pah Muchin­guri Kashiri re­ferred to a few weeks ago — wildlife colo­nial­ism. And she’s fed up of it. “We hope wildlife colo­nial­ism ends so com­mu­ni­ties and con­ser­van­cies, es­pe­cially, ben­e­fit. Peo­ple must see a value in their wildlife so that sus­tain­able util­i­sa­tion with no poach­ing will con­tinue,” she told The Herald Busi­ness in an in­ter­view. It is al­most a decade since Zim­babwe’s last com­mer­cial sale in ivory. A once off sale of 3 700kg to Ja­pan and China on Novem­ber 1, 2008, gen­er­ated about $500 000, which was duly de­clared Cites, ZimParks act­ing di­rec­tor gen­eral Wil­son Mutin­hima said in a pre­vi­ous in­ter­view. In South Africa, Harare was aim­ing to con­vince the world that ivory has value be­yond what it rep­re­sents on a live an­i­mal, par­tic­u­larly to those na­tions bur­dened by poor fund­ing and an over-pop­u­la­tion of ele­phants, which of­ten de­stroy forests and food crops. Zim­babwe wants to be al­lowed to sell its ele­phants — 80 000 of them, its 96 000 kilo­grammes of ivory, and its li­ons to help raise rev­enue to pro­tect the same, ac­cord­ing to ZimParks. The coun­try is cur­rently pro­hib­ited by the Cites from trad­ing in ele­phant or its tusks ex­cept in excep- tional cir­cum­stances — and it is likely to re­turn from South Africa dis­ap­pointed, hands empty.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180103,Venezuela’s ‘hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis’ and its US ori­gins,"ANEW York Times head­line screams “As Venezuela col­lapses, chil­dren are dy­ing of hunger”. Lurid pic­tures show dead in­fants. A com­pan­ion “ar­ti­cle of the day teach­ing ac­tiv­i­ties” asks: “Why do some young chil­dren choose to live on the streets in­stead of at home with their fam­i­lies?” The key to un­der­stand­ing the well­spring of the Times’ in­dig­na­tion about hu­man­i­tar­ian is­sues con­fronting Venezuela is hinted at in the by-line to the ar­ti­cle: “Venezuela has the largest proven oil re­serves in the world.” The stakes are high for the US em­pire. The back story is that the Times and the rest of the cor­po­rate me­dia have cheered on US gov­ern­ment poli­cies that have con­trib­uted to the cur­rent grave sit­u­a­tion in Venezuela, while ob­struct­ing so­lu­tions other than regime change. Although the Times cat­er­wauls about the Venezue­lan pres­i­dent’s “drive to dic­ta­tor­ship”, the news­pa­per of record fails to sup­port mediation be­tween the cur­rent gov­ern­ment and el­e­ments of the now de­mor­alised op­po­si­tion who are will­ing to ac­cept an out­come short of regime change. Rather, the Times blithely opines “No nation should have to suf­fer such a leader”. Regime change in Venezue­lan would only put into power an un­pop­u­lar op­po­si­tion with no plan or in­cli­na­tion to ad­dress eco­nomic re­cov­ery. When the Venezue­lan peo­ple went to the polls, as they did in the last two most re­cent elec­tions, they sup­ported the present Maduro gov­ern­ment de­spite the dif­fi­cul­ties that the Times so melo­dra­mat­i­cally cherry picks. The vot­ers knew sur­vival would be worse un­der the US-backed op­po­si­tion. Chal­lenges of the Venezue­lan Econ­omy While there is no deny­ing the eco­nomic emer­gency that Venezuela is cur­rently fac­ing and the con­comi­tant suf­fer­ing it is caus­ing its peo­ple, un­der­stand­ing its con­text is es­sen­tial to see­ing a way out. Af­ter a string of oli­garchic gov­ern­ments dat­ing back to 1959 and the ne­olib­eral eco­nomic col­lapse and de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of liv­ing con­di­tions for work­ing peo­ple in Venezuela of the 1990s, Hugo Chávez was elected pres­i­dent in 1998. He in­sti­tuted mea­sures, which dis­pleased Wash­ing­ton and its syco­phan­tic press: • Us­ing Venezuela’s vast oil wealth for so­cial pro­grammes, rather than en­rich­ing the rich. • Pro­mot­ing an in­de­pen­dent for­eign pol­icy, while cre­at­ing re­gional al­liances. • En­cour­ag­ing and em­pow­er­ing pop­u­lar par­tic­i­pa­tion in the af­fairs of state. A coup in 2002, backed by the US and cheered by the Times, failed to re­move Chávez. In­stead, Chávez’s Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion en­joyed spec­tac­u­lar suc­cesses as it openly de­clared it­self so­cial­ist, a term anath­ema to the US gov­ern­ment and its cor­po­rate me­dia. Poverty rates were re­duced in half; ex­treme poverty rates were cut even more. Com­mu­nity ra­dio sta­tions, com­munes, and co­op­er­a­tives were cre­ated. Well over a mil­lion homes were built for the poor. Re­gional al­liances, ex­clud­ing the US, came to­gether. And the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple af­firmed and reaf­firmed what has be­come known as Chávismo in elec­tion af­ter elec­tion. Then in 2013 Hugo Chávez died, and his suc­ces­sor Ni­colás Maduro be­came pres­i­dent of Venezuela in a closely con­tested elec­tion. Maduro in­her­ited not only the man­tle of Chávismo, but a con­stel­la­tion of chal­lenges that would have plagued Chávez him­self had he con­tin­ued: wide­spread and deeply in­grained cor­rup­tion cou­pled with bu­reau­cratic in­ef­fi­cien­cies, a dys­func­tional cur­rency sys­tem, and an in­grained and re­cal­ci­trant crim­i­nal el­e­ment. Fur­ther, Chávez had granted amnesty to the per­pe­tra­tors of the 2002 coup. These same “golpis­tas” are now among the lead­er­ship of a vi­o­lent op­po­si­tion to Maduro. What ap­peared to be a gra­cious ges­ture in 2002 has come back to plague and threaten the very ex­is­tence of the Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion. Yet all these chal­lenges to the suc­cess of the Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion in Venezuela pale in sig­nif­i­cance com­pared to two cat­a­clysmic ex­ter­nal fac­tors. • The so­cial pro­grammes that Chávez had in­sti­tuted as well as aid to other coun­tries had been sub­sidised by an oil com­mod­ity boom. Mean­while, the costs of the ex­ist­ing in­ef­fi­cien­cies and cor­rup­tion were partly ob­scured in an econ­omy flush with petrodol­lars. Then the bot­tom fell out of the oil mar­ket. • Last but by no means least has been the en­dur­ing hos­til­ity of the US em­pire, pro­mot­ing, fund­ing, and em­bold­en­ing both the in­ter­nal op­po­si­tion and Venezuela’s in­ter­na­tional op­po­si­tion such as US client narco-states Colom­bia and Mex­ico. The re­sult is that, de­spite bold mea­sures, the econ­omy and by ex­ten­sion liv­ing con­di­tions in Venezuela con­tinue to trend down­ward. The Times in Ser­vice of the US Em­pire In an un­bro­ken tra­jec­tory, the US em­pire has worked to over­throw the Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion in Venezuela from its in­cep­tion. Ge­orge W. Bush tried to de­pose Chávez in the failed mil­i­tary coup of 2002. His suc­ces­sor, Barak Obama, de­clared Venezuela “an un­usual and ex­traor­di­nary threat to the na­tional se­cu­rity and for­eign pol­icy of the United States” and im­posed sanc­tions on Venezue­lan of­fi­cials. Now Don­ald Trump has echoed Obama’s non­sense about Venezuela pos­ing a na­tional se­cu­rity threat to the US and dou­bled down with new sanc­tions and even threats of mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tion. The US pol­icy is not based on mu­tual re­spect for na­tional sovereignty and the rule of in­ter­na­tional law, but aimed at regime change in Venezuela. The Times and the other cor­po­rate me­dia are mouth­pieces for this pol­icy. While cry­ing croc­o­dile tears about the suf­fer­ing of the Venezue­lan peo­ple, they sup­port poli­cies that re­lent­lessly ex­ac­er­bate hu­man mis­ery as a means of un­der­min­ing pop­u­lar sup­port for the Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion. These me­dia are the pro­mot­ers of the very con­di­tions that they hyp­o­crit­i­cally claim to be op­pos­ing. The re­cent US sanc­tions are de­signed to pre­vent eco­nomic re­cov­ery in Venezuela. The sanc­tions cut off needed ac­cess to in­ter­na­tional credit and block the Venezue­lan gov­ern­ment from re­struc­tur­ing its debt. US Pres­i­dent Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der in Au­gust, which barred deal­ings in new debt and eq­uity is­sued by the Venezue­lan gov­ern­ment and its state oil com­pany, has frozen over $3 bil­lion in Venezue­lan as­sets. Some of the con­se­quences of the eco­nomic war against Venezuela, are: • Funds were frozen for the im­port of in­sulin, even though Venezuela had the money. • Colom­bia blocked a ship­ment of the anti-malaria medicine Pri­maquine. • Pay­ments were sus­pended to for­eign sup­pli­ers for three months hold­ing up the ar­rival of 29 con­tainer ships car­ry­ing sup­plies needed to process and pro­duce food prod­ucts. These re­cent de­vel­op­ments syn­er­gise with the on­go­ing eco­nomic war by the tra­di­tional oli­garchy in Venezuela, which takes the form of with­hold­ing goods from the mar­ket to cre­ate short­ages, traf­fick­ing in con­tra­band, and ma­nip­u­la­tion of the cur­rency. While hurt­ing the peo­ple, the irony of the US sanc­tions is that they have bol­stered the pop­u­lar­ity of the Maduro gov­ern­ment and ex­posed the com­plic­ity of the op­po­si­tion. All the Fake News That’s Fit to Print A Times video, “Strong­men who’ve started blam­ing ‘fake news’ too”, fin­gers the cor­po­rate me­dia’s usual sus­pects: Rus­sia, Iran, China, and Myan­mar. High­lighted among the “strong­men” is Venezuela’s Pres­i­dent Maduro, who is mocked for think­ing that “fake news was part of a West­ern con­spir­acy to hurt his coun­try”. The Times self-serv­ingly at­tempts to re­but Maduro, claim­ing that surely his view can­not be the case be­cause the very news that Maduro crit­i­cizes is from the US, which has “a free and vi­brant press”. In short, the Times laments the con­se­quences of the poli­cies it sup­ports, while op­pos­ing so­lu­tions short of regime change. The hos­til­ity of the Times to the Bo­li­var­ian Rev­o­lu­tion is not pred­i­cated on hu­man­i­tar­ian grounds. If it were, the Times would be de­fend­ing its gains rather than polemi­cis­ing for a ne­olib­eral counter-rev­o­lu­tion. The Venezue­lans should be al­lowed to solve their own prob­lems. The re­spon­si­bil­ity of the US cit­i­zenry and its press alike should be to op­pose in­ter­fer­ence by our gov­ern­ment, which trans­lates to no sanc­tions and no med­dling in Venezuela’s in­ter­nal pol­i­tics. - Coun­ter­punch",津巴布韦

Euro­cen­tric civil­i­sa­tion has been used over the past two cen­turies to mo­ti­vate for­get­ting in the African per­son­al­ity, to cre­ate am­ne­sia, and to main­tain re­pres­sion, be it men­tally, phys­i­cally or eco­nom­i­cally. Many of our peo­ple, as in­di­vid­u­als, would rather seek to for­get cer­tain as­pects of our his­tory; they do not want to con­front this his­tory be­cause they want to es­cape anx­i­ety, anger, fear, shame and even guilt. Some young Zim­bab­weans will eas­ily dis­miss his­tory say­ing: “Colo­nial­ism ended 38 years ago; the lib­er­a­tion war was fought four decades ago; this is 2018, and all these things have noth­ing to do with us to­day”. They just do not want to be re­minded, be­cause they want to es­cape their own in­ad­e­qua­cies. The re­al­ity of the black Zim­bab­wean to­day is that we are all af­fected and suf­fer­ing from the 1890 colo­nial ex­pe­ri­ence, re­gard­less of whether we know what hap­pened or not. In fact, it is worse for us if we do not know what hap­pened, as is ev­i­dently the case. Rus­sell Ja­coby writes in his book, “So­cial Am­ne­sia”: “Ex­actly be­cause the past is for­got­ten, it rules un­chal­lenged. To be tran­scended it must be re­mem­bered. So­cial am­ne­sia is so­ci­ety’s re­pres­sion of re­mem­brance.” Sim­ply be­cause we choose not to re­mem­ber what hap­pened at in­de­pen­dence, or what hap­pened dur­ing colo­nial­ism; what hap­pened dur­ing the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle that we choose not to learn of the trau­mas of our past; that does not mean that the his­tory we are try­ing to es­cape does not con­trol our be­hav­iour. Amos N. Wil­son ar­gues that “the most pow­er­ful forces that shape hu­man be­hav­iour are those fac­tors that are con­sciously not re­mem­bered by hu­man be­ings, that (be­come) un­known to the per­son, those ex­pe­ri­ences a per­son can swear he has never heard”. That be­comes the para­dox of our African predica­ment. We for­get the as­pects of our lives that ac­tu­ally shape our be­hav­iour to­day. We for­get that in­fe­ri­or­ity was nur­tured into us by the colo­nial legacy and that it has shaped our be­hav­iour. Where are we run­ning to in our time of need, even when the West is look­ing East in the wake of the rise of China? So we have a peo­ple who do not want to re­mem­ber the painful parts of our past. They un­con­sciously try to for­get the bru­tal­i­ties of slav­ery, the in­jus­tice over Africa’s stolen wealth, the seg­re­ga­tion of the colo­nial legacy, the in­ca­pac­i­tat­ing sub­ju­ga­tion that cre­ated em­ploy­ees out of us, and some of us have even suc­ceeded in for­get­ting these ex­pe­ri­ences com­pletely; but this does not mean those ex­pe­ri­ences do not con­tinue to op­er­ate within our per­son­al­i­ties. So we look at our­selves and say we can­not pos­si­bly turn around our econ­omy with­out the guid­ance of the white per­son. We tell our­selves we are blacks, and it is sim­ply not pos­si­ble for us to run com­mer­cial farms pro­duc­tively and prof­itably. We scorn at the African ini­tia­tive, we de­ride lo­cal in­vest­ment. We say Cyril Ramaphosa is about to de­stroy South Africa by ad­vo­cat­ing blacks in South Africa to as­sume con­trol of their own re­sources. South Africa has a his­tory of re­pres­sion of the black per­son, and that re­pres­sion has only been lifted po­lit­i­cally while eco­nomic marginal­i­sa­tion of the black masses has gone un­abated for 24 years after in­de­pen­dence. Es­capism teaches us to es­cape this eco­nomic re­pres­sion and such things as the poverty regime in Soweto by pre­tend­ing that we can­not re­mem­ber apartheid; pre­tend­ing that South Africa is an all-in­clu­sive democ­racy whose “in­ter­na­tion­ally ac­cept­able” sta­tus as pi­o­neered by Nel­son Man­dela must be pre­served. We ca­su­ally ac­cept that the high crime rate in Jo­han­nes­burg is just part of South African life. So we are in a democ­racy in Zim­babwe that makes us ac­cept that we can­not run our own econ­omy, that we can­not run com­mer­cial farms, a democ­racy that says we can­not con­trol even half of the wealth of the coun­try, a democ­racy that makes us ashamed of hav­ing a his­tory of “mis­treat­ing” the civilised and ca­pa­ble white man dur­ing Mu­gabe’s era. So we are sup­posed to be ashamed and re­gret that we took back our land. We are sup­posed to be ashamed that Ramaphosa wants blacks in South Africa to have their land back. We are sup­posed to be ashamed and to view black eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment as un­demo­cratic, un­sound and un­civilised. Our land re­form pro­gramme is de­scribed as dis­as­trous in the West, and South Africa is be­ing threat­ened with sanc­tions and iso­la­tion should they fol­low the “dis­as­trous’’ route started by neigh­bour­ing Zim­babwe. We live a con­scious­ness that tells us that prior to slav­ery and colo­nial­ism we Africans were essen­tially cul­tur­ally in­vis­i­ble and sav­age, and that we only achieved ci­vil­ity and vis­i­bil­ity when the Euro­pean came on the scene. This is the in­ca­pac­i­tat­ing men­tal­ity that makes us the most un­pro­duc­tive peo­ple on the planet. This is pre­cisely why many, if not most Zim­bab­weans, doubt the ca­pac­ity of the new farmer; that is why we can­not en­vis­age an econ­omy whose means of pro­duc­tion is con­trolled by lo­cal in­vestors. We think on our own with no white in­put we are un­civilised sav­ages in­ca­pable of mean­ing­ful eco­nomic achieve­ment. Those of us who, in the name of hu­man rights and democ­racy, may choose to re­press any knowl­edge of our colo­nial or apartheid ex­pe­ri­ence should heed the fact that peo­ple who suf­fer from so­cial am­ne­sia live lives that are de­ter­mined by fear, anx­i­ety, ter­ror and trauma. In fact, the eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed on Zim­babwe by the West over the last 18 years were specif­i­cally tar­geted at cre­at­ing these four as­pects of so­cial am­ne­sia. At this mo­ment we have learnt our lessons. We are afraid, anx­ious, ter­ri­fied and trau­ma­tised by the sanc­tion­sin­duced poverty we have suf­fered for nearly two decades. We saw that Nel­son Chamisa’s cam­paign was cen­tred on in­still­ing fear, anx­i­ety, ter­ror and trauma in the poor masses. The peo­ple were told end­lessly and var­i­ously that with­out the West their lives will al­ways be mis­er­able, with­out the whites Zim­babwe will just sink, and that only the MDC Al­liance is the trusted party that will bring back the joy of as­so­ci­at­ing with the pol­i­tics of the Euro­pean. Right now Nel­son Chamisa says he holds the keys to Western benev­o­lence, and he has more than two mil­lion sup­port­ers who be­lieved him. Now it is all shift­ing to in­vest­ment poli­cies. We are told white in­vestors will not come to Zim­babwe be­cause of Zanu-PF. But we can­not build a na­tion on fear, anx­i­ety, ter­ror and trauma. Those things must never be al­lowed to be the de­ter­min­ing fac­tors of how Africa shapes its fu­ture. As it is, we live not in terms of our re­al­ity or in terms of the in­te­gra­tion of our re­al­ity, but in terms of what we are afraid of, what we are ashamed of, what we are try­ing to hide from; and what we are try­ing not to con­front our­selves with.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180116,‘Sh*thole’ coun­tries can be­come classy places Don­ald,"WHENDon­ald Trump re­ferred to coun­tries like Nige­ria and re­ally, all of Africa, and the long-suf­fer­ing is­land of Haiti in the Caribbean as “sh*tholes” to a bunch of stunned mem­bers of Congress yes­ter­day (Jan­uary 14), he was not just show­ing his deeply-rooted ugly racist self, but also his pro­found ig­no­rance about the world — and his own coun­try. The truth is that yes­ter­day’s “sh*thole coun­tries” of­ten be­come to­day’s mod­ern suc­cess sto­ries. Nor­way is a case in point. As late as the early 1960s, Nor­way, as Paul Thorn­ton, a colum­nist for the Los An­ge­les Times, him­self a de­scen­dant of Nor­we­gian im­mi­grants to the US, writes, once was “the sh*thole of Scan­di­navia,” its peo­ple viewed by more pros­per­ous and mod­ern Swedes and Danes as poor, ig­no­rant farm­ers, then the coun­try struck oil in the North Sea, and since then, avoid­ing go­ing the route of many oil-pro­duc­ing na­tions, has be­come one of the rich­est coun­tries in the world on a per-capita ba­sis, with a stan­dard of liv­ing about 25 per­cent higher than ours here in the US, and with the wealth much more evenly and fairly dis­trib­uted, too. Why can’t the US get im­mi­grants from Nor­way, in­stead of “sh*thole” coun­tries in Africa and the Caribbean, the pres­i­dent asked? Well, be­cause no­body in Nor­way, with its gold-plated free na­tional health care sys­tem, ex­cel­lent and well-funded re­tire­ment sys­tem and ed­u­ca­tional sys­tem, etc., would want to live here, duh. In fact, Thorn­ton says many sec­ond and third-gen­er­a­tion Nor­we­gians liv­ing in the US are look­ing at whether they might have a chance of get­ting cit­i­zen­ship rights in Nor­way these days. I know what I’m talk­ing about. Back in 1991, when I got a Ful­bright pro­fes­sor­ship to China and moved for a year with my fam­ily to Shang­hai, which at the time was one of China’s wealth­ier cities, the place was, frankly, what you would call a “sh*thole.” Most peo­ple, in­clud­ing pro­fes­sors at Fu­dan Univer­sity, a lead­ing in­sti­tu­tion of higher ed­u­ca­tion where I was placed to teach jour­nal­ism, were liv­ing in one or two-room con­crete flats with no heat and only cold wa­ter, of­ten with­out even a pri­vate bath­room or kitchen. (Our daugh­ter’s lo­cal el­e­men­tary school had no heat ei­ther, so in the win­ter, they left the win­dows open to warm the class­rooms up dur­ing the day­time, while the kids wore gloves with the tips cut off so they could use their pen­cils.) As for work­ing class peo­ple, many were liv­ing in far worse ac­com­mo­da­tions. The air in win­ter was filled with soot as peo­ple tried to keep warm with char­coal stoves in their apart­ments, which caused ev­ery­one to suf­fer wrack­ing coughs, my­self in­cluded. Mean­while, the streets were clogged with mil­lions of bi­cy­cles ev­ery day be­cause there was only min­i­mal pub­lic trans­porta­tion in the form of rick­ety buses that were packed as tightly as canned sar­dines and that had to crawl their way through rivers of peo­ple ped­alling their bikes slowly to and from work, of­ten for hours each way. And Shang­hai was about as good as it got. If you went into the coun­try­side, peas­ants were liv­ing in hov­els. For bath­rooms, they used cramped stone pub­lic out­houses where the stench of urine and yes, sh*t, was so over­pow­er­ing that one had to take long deep breaths be­fore en­ter­ing, and then hope to be able to hold it un­til one was done and could es­cape into the open air. There are still plenty of places in China, a huge coun­try of 1,4 bil­lion peo­ple, that might qual­ify, in the pres­i­dent’s colour­ful lan­guage, as “sh*thole,” but most are much bet­ter. Shang­hai, mean­while, in the in­ter­ven­ing 25 years since I left, is a mod­ern me­trop­o­lis. Most of the bikes have van­ished, re­placed not just by cars and mo­tor-scoot­ers, but by a mod­ern 400mile sub­way sys­tem as large as New York City’s and even a mag-lev train from the city’s cen­tre to a gleam­ing new in­ter­na­tional air­port, which whisks pas­sen­gers at a speed of 225mph so smoothly that you don’t know you’re mov­ing un­less you look at the blurred land­scape out­side the win­dows. High-speed rail lines whisk peo­ple from Shang­hai to other sim­i­larly mod­ern cities like Bei­jing and Guangzhou at speeds in ex­cess of 150mph, mak­ing it faster to go by rail from city cen­tre to city cen­tre than to take a plane. The truth is, Mr Pres­i­dent, viewed from Shang­hai to­day, Amer­ica re­ally looks a lot like a “sh*thole coun­try.” It cer­tainly looks that way from the per­spec­tive of a lot of places I’ve been: Ger­many, Aus­tria, Fin­land, Ja­pan and even lit­tle Tai­wan for ex­am­ple. And de­spite all your talk about a huge in­fra­struc­ture pro­gramme, you haven’t done squat to im­prove things. This is a coun­try that has ig­nored its cities, al­low­ing them to sink into de­cay and squalor. It has also for­got­ten its ru­ral re­gions. And that’s not the fault of the peo­ple who live there. It’s be­cause a cor­rupt po­lit­i­cal sys­tem at all lev­els - fed­eral, state and lo­cal - has de­funded them, leav­ing them job­less, home­less, and with de­crepit in­fra­struc­ture. I’m sure you’ll blame the lo­cal peo­ple, but truth to tell, those are in many cases the very (white) peo­ple you call “the for­got­ten Amer­i­cans”. You told them you were go­ing to ride to their as­sis­tance as pres­i­dent, but you’ve done the op­po­site. Most of them are so poor, they de­pend on our crappy Med­i­caid pro­gramme for their health care and you and your Repub­li­can en­ablers in Congress are cut­ting that dras­ti­cally, which will leave them with­out health care. Mean­while, their towns are go­ing bust, try­ing to come up with funds to re­pair ag­ing wa­ter sys­tems, worn-out roads and un­der­funded, over­crowded schools. You’re do­ing noth­ing about that. Their homes are of­ten trail­ers be­cause they can’t af­ford a real house. A whole gen­er­a­tion of Amer­i­cans is en­ter­ing adult­hood a col­lec­tive $1,3 tril­lion in debt be­cause there’s no sys­tem of true pub­lic higher ed­u­ca­tion. In­stead, so-called pub­lic col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties to­day cost al­most as much to at­tend as pri­vate in­sti­tu­tions. Why? Be­cause rich jerks like you don’t think that ed­u­cat­ing Amer­i­cans is the gov­ern­ment’s job, and hav­ing an ed­u­cated pub­lic is not in the na­tional in­ter­est. Amer­ica isn’t en­tirely a “sh*thole,” be­cause our wealthy, like you, and even the up­per mid­dle class, can hide from all the shit around them caused by gov­ern­ment tax and spend­ing poli­cies that favour them over the broader mass of the pop­u­la­tion by stay­ing safely in their gated hous­ing com­mu­ni­ties built in eco­nom­i­cally seg­re­gated ju­ris­dic­tions. But that leaves the rest of the coun­try go­ing to the dogs while those in the gated and seg­re­gated com­mu­ni­ties like you don’t give a shit. Even­tu­ally, the way things are go­ing, you’ll be pre­sid­ing over a “sh*thole coun­try” your­self. We’re pretty close to be­ing there now, in my opin­ion, with more than half of each year’s en­tire fed­eral tax take go­ing to fund a bloated mil­i­tary that it looks like you want to keep send­ing off to the far corners of the earth to make sh*tholes out of other al­ready strug­gling lands. Mat­ter of fact, a num­ber of the places you con­sider to be “sh*tholes,” like Haiti, An­gola, the Congo, and prob­a­bly Ye­men and Libya, are suf­fer­ing from grind­ing poverty in large part be­cause of the ac­tions of this coun­try. Look it up. The US ac­tu­ally ran - and stole blind - the coun­try of Haiti from 1915 to 1934, and has treated it as a colo­nial pos­ses­sion since then. As for Libya, ev­ery­one knows the US sim­ply de­stroyed the coun­try and left it a failed state, mired in in­ter­nal con­flict and vir­tu­ally un­govern­able. You’re con­tin­u­ing the same process (be­gun by Pres­i­dent Obama) in Syria to­day, and are do­ing it by proxy by arm­ing the Saudi Ara­bian mil­i­tary in its vi­cious war on Ye­men. ◆ Dave Lin­dorff is a found­ing mem­ber of ThisCan­tBeHap­pen­ing!, an on­line news­pa­per col­lec­tive, and is a con­trib­u­tor to Hope­less: Barack Obama and the Pol­i­tics of Il­lu­sion (AK Press).

zw,The Standard (Zimbabwe),20150104,Mega business deals should not re­main on pa­per The econ­omy will im­prove in 2015,"Last year Zim­babwe penned a num­ber of mega deals which were feted as the panacea to the coun­try’s woes. The ma­jor deals agreed in­clude a US$1 bil­lion plat­inum min­ing project with Rus­sian in­vestors who have promised to set up a mine in the Great Dyke and build a ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion plant. The gov­ern­ment also an­nounced the con­clu­sion of ma­jor in­vest­ment deals with the Chi­nese who pledged to put to­gether a fi­nance pack­age for in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment, farm­ing, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and power gen­er­a­tion. The self-con­grat­u­la­tions from politi­cians after the con­clu­sion of the deals have how­ever not trans­lated into tan­gi­ble ben­e­fits for the na­tion. For a long time, we have al­lowed our rulers to di­vert at­ten­tion from their short­com­ings by an­nounc­ing mega projects which have ei­ther not seen the light of day or have ben­e­fit­ted a few party ap­pa­ratchiks. The re­sult of this mis­rule is the un­em­ploy­ment and ur­ban poverty that have taken hold of the coun­try. The deals which were signed last year res­onate with the cur­rent na­tional as­pi­ra­tions to cre­ate em­ploy­ment, im­prove food se­cu­rity, gen­er­ate more power and im­prove the crum­bling in­fra­struc­ture. But they have to be im­ple­mented first. Coun­tries in the re­gion, es­pe­cially An­gola, Mozam­bique and Zam­bia have grown their economies on the back of in­ward in­vest­ment in the ex­trac­tive sec­tor and in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. Zim­babwe which al­ways boasts of abun­dant nat­u­ral re­sources, es­pe­cially min­er­als, can im­prove the lot for Zim­bab­weans if in­vest­ment deals an­nounced amid pomp and cer­e­mony are im­ple­mented in full. Un­for­tu­nately, the Zim­babwe gov­ern­ment does not a have a good track record in this area as ev­i­denced by the dis­ap­pear­ance of bil­lions of dol­lars de­rived from di­a­monds mined in Marange since 2000. The di­a­mond re­serves have di­min­ished and the na­tion is still look­ing for an­swers. That is not all. The 2011 US$750 mil­lion Es­sar deal to re­vive steel gi­ant Zis­cos­teel has not been con­sum­mated. There is no clear rea­son to ex­plain the de­lay. This key na­tional as­set is not ben­e­fit­ting the na­tion at all at the mo­ment de­spite the abun­dance of iron ore and coal in the coun­try. We have for a long time al­lowed our lead­ers to ex­plain them­selves out of fail­ure. As the year be­gins, we need to hold th­ese lead­ers to ac­count for prom­ises made es­pe­cially on the in­vest­ment front. The gov­ern­ment must be pres­sured to come up with clear time­lines on the ex­e­cu­tion of in­vest­ment deals. The ben­e­fits of in­vest­ment must be ap­par­ent to all. The Chi­nese and Rus­sian deals must not be al­lowed to fiz­zle out. It is time for tan­gi­ble ac­tion and not empty rhetoric. A view of Zis­cos­teel in Red­cliff . . . the deal signed to re­vive steel pro­duc­tion is yet to come to fruition Judg­ing from the events and in­ter­ven­tions made by the gov­ern­ment in the past12 months, the new year seems to be very promis­ing, that is if all stake­hold­ers do not sit on their lau­rels and sleep on duty. Syl­lo­gism, that is de­duc­tive rea­son­ing, shows that the econ­omy of this coun­try is go­ing to im­prove tremen­dously as op­posed to what the prophets of doom in some sec­tions are say­ing. Of con­cern how­ever is the fact that the coun­try con­tin­ues to strug­gle to at­tract mean­ing­ful for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI), hence our en­e­mies and the prophets of doom who are singing for their sup­per are pes­simistic about the eco­nomic fu­ture of the coun­try. Pro­gres­sive and pa­tri­otic Zim­bab­weans think oth­er­wise and view the coun­try as mov­ing in the right di­rec­tion. Not­with­stand­ing the chal­lenges plagu­ing our econ­omy, there is now grow­ing op­ti­mism that Zim­babwe is now ready to do business. This is epit­o­mis ed by the mega deals which were signed by the gov­ern­ment and other coun­tries in an en­deav­our to prop up the econ­omy. The land­mark multi-bil­lion dol­lar deals signed with Rus­sia and China tellingly in­di­cate that Zim­babwe has now joined forces with co­op­er­at­ing part­ners that are will­ing to un­der­write projects in­tended to cover the coun­try’s in­fras­truc­tural deficit. Thus, once the deals are rolled out, they have the po­ten­tial to pro­vide the stim­u­lus to eco­nomic ac­cel­er­a­tion. We have to take cog­ni­sance of the fact that projects in wa­ter, power and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions are largely re­garded as key en­ablers for eco­nomic growth. More­over the plat­inum min­ing project in Dar­wen­dale, which Zim­babwe en­tered into with Rus­sia, is con­sid­ered to be key to the coun­try’s fu­ture eco­nomic growth prospects. Three min­ers al­ready op­er­at­ing in the coun- RUS­SIA’S For­eign Af­fairs min­is­ter Sergey Lavrov with Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe dur­ing a tour of Dar­wen­dale in Septem­ber last year. try — Zim­plats, Mi­mosa and Unki have a com­bined out­put of about 430 000 ounces a year. Most im­por­tantly, it is es­ti­mated that the new plat­inum project will cre­ate more than 8 000 jobs and a smelter will also be es­tab­lished. This dove­tails with the coun­try’s eco­nomic blue­print, Zim As­set, which em­pha­sizes on value ad­di­tion and ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion. Al­ready the coun­try is haem­or­rhag­ing sig­nif­i­cant rev­enues through ex­port­ing ore to South African re­fin­ers. We should also re­mem­ber that the coun­try has the sec­ond largest known plat­inum re­serves in the world after South Africa and is the world’s third largest pro­ducer of the metal. Through bi­lat­eral agree­ments China has com­mit­ted to pro­vid­ing fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to criti- cal sec­tors such as en­ergy, roads, tourism, rail­way net­work, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and agri­cul­ture. If all the stake­hold­ers work with a common cause we will reach the promised land of milk and honey. Hence Zim­babwe will be the bea­con of eco­nomic pros­per­ity in the re­gion. Bri­tish and Turk­ish del­e­ga­tions were also re­cently sent to Zim­babwe to ex­plore in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in var­i­ous sec­tors of the lo­cal econ­omy. In ad­di­tion to this, big brands have re­turned to Zim­babwe in the likes of Ken­tucky Fried Chicken (KFC), Chip­pies and Puma En­ergy. It would be wise there­fore to con­clude that Zim­babwe will spring-up and pros­per sooner rather than later!",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20200823,Zim econ­omy fi­nally be­ing ‘rigged’,"NEL­SON CHAMISA and his MDC-Al­liance lost the elec­tion in the July 2018 elec­tions of the post-Mu­gabe era. Re­act­ing to this loss, he cock­ily pro­nounced that it was of no con­se­quence. His agenda hence­forth would be to en­sure that the coun­try is un­govern­able through ex­tra-par­lia­men­tary and ex­tra-con­sti­tu­tional dis­rup­tion. “Mu­takura wa­cho tichaudira jecha ti­goona kuti achaudya ndi­ani?” Here was a self-pro­claimed man of God em­brac­ing the mu­tu­ally as­sured de­struc­tive path of bib­li­cal strong­man Sam­son of the Tem­ple.

His Bri­tish South Africa Com­pany (BSAC) raised the Bri­tish flag in Sal­is­bury as an agent and not a de­part­ment of the Crown.

Through his­tory, gold has dis­tin­guished it­self as the global cur­rency of supreme choice of all hu­man­ity. If other na­tions worked hard to pro­duce goods to trade, Zim­babwe pos­sessed the ul­ti­mate money — gold. No won­der In­dian mon­soon winds had Arab dhows ply­ing be­tween the ports of the Mun­hu­mu­tapa and var­i­ous trad­ing cen­tres along the lit­toral In­dian Ocean. Turkey, Ara­bia, Iran, Egypt, So­ma­lia, Iran, In­dia, Indo-Malay and even far-away China all con­ducted com­merce first with Ma­pun­gubwe, later with Great Zim­babwe, Khami, Danamombe and oth­ers. The BSAC cor­po­rate gov­ern­ing au­thor­ity lost no time in dis­plac­ing the freely in­ter­change­able gold cur­rency with fiat pa­per money. The Rhode­sian dol­lar was there pri­mar­ily to cater for the grow­ing white-set­tled mi­nor­ity com­mu­nity. The in­dige­nous ma­jor­ity were dis­pos­sessed of the pre­cious his­tor­i­cal gold mines by “blanket ex­plor­ers”, hence the en­dur­ing name of Blanket Mine. These were white set­tlers who bought blan­kets on the Rand of South Africa. They then used the blan­kets as com­pen­sa­tion to the in­dige­nous African own­ers of robbed gold mines. The ma­raud­ing new white own­ers went back to reg­is­ter their newly pos­sessed mines with the min­ing com­mis­sioner at the BSAC head­quar­ters in Jo­han­nes­burg. The brisk trade in blan­kets earned them the moniker “blanket ex­plor­ers” of Rhode­sia. The tem­plate of an econ­omy built upon plun­der could not en­ter­tain the free in­ter­play of sup­ply and de­mand in the colo­nial ter­ri­tory. It nat­u­rally de­faulted to al­lo­ca­tion so as to en­gen­der the out­flow of money from the black African ma­jor­ity to the com­pany’s cof­fers. The un­just en­rich­ment was then shipped out to Lon­don, New York and other Euro­pean me­trop­o­lises of global bank­ing and fi­nance. It is note­wor­thy that the new colony lost no time in set­ting up a stock ex­change in Mutare. This was in prox­im­ity to the Man­ica head­quar­ters of King Mtasa on the Mozam­bique side. He su­per­in­tended a thriv­ing gold mar­ket or feira, which both im­pe­rial Lis­bon and Lon­don en­vied. Hae­m­or­rhage This pre­cur­sor to the Zim­babwe Stock Ex­change had a lop-sided im­pe­rial de­sign to trans­fer riches out of Africa to Europe. Is it not re­mark­able that in the 140 years of the ZSE it only started trad­ing in con­vert­ible hard cur­rency as re­cently as 1993? More sin­is­ter that a fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pany that started off as a de­part­ment of fi­nance of BSAC went on to slyly ask for se­lec­tive and ex­clu­sive fun­gi­bil­ity of its counter. Sadly, the poverty in sound grasp of fi­nan­cial the­ory in the post-in­de­pen­dent African ma­jor­ity rule govern­ment obliged. Presto, the ar­range­ment ef­fec­tively con­verted the ZSE into a par­al­lel and com­pet­ing mon­e­tary au­thor­ity chal­leng­ing the cen­tral bank (Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe). There would be near-fa­tal con­se­quences to this fi­nan­cial and mon­e­tary skul­dug­gery of se­lec­tive fun­gi­bil­ity. It fa­cil­i­tated a cap­i­tal flight of hae­m­or­rhage pro­por­tions worse than that of na­tions plunged into war. The de­cep­tive ar­gu­ments for fun­gi­bil­ity were ex­posed as cap­i­tal-starved Harare be­gan re­mit­ting hard cur­rency to rich Lon­don, Jo­han­nes­burg, New York et cetera. The whole­sale di­vest­ment would trig­ger strato­spheric hy­per­in­fla­tion. By 2008, the ve­loc­ity of money cir­cu­lat­ing in the Zim­babwe na­tional econ­omy would eclipse even the fastest speed of light. This phys­i­cal im­pos­si­bil­ity could only have come from num­ber-crunch­ing by a ded­i­cated num­bers ma­chine called a cal­cu­la­tor. This cal­cu­la­tor was owned by the gamut of neo-lib­eral global fi­nance fig­ures, in­clud­ing Ge­orge Soros. They con­cocted a stock de­riv­a­tive called Old Mu­tual Im­plied Rate, an Ex­changeTraded Fund (ETF) run from Bos­ton Mas­sachusetts. Here is the para­dox of para­doxes: How does the bas­ket case econ­omy of Zim­babwe af­ford to sus­tain an ETF that traded on the New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE)? Yes, that tril­lion-dol­lar global be­he­moth of raising in­vest­ment cap­i­tal. For those who have read global fi­nance be­yond lawyer Biti, I dare you to check out BrightSphere In­vest­ment Group Inc (BSIG). It was bap­tised out of Old Mu­tual As­set Man­age­ment Com­pany (OMAM). This re-chris­ten­ing was ne­ces­si­tated by the po­lit­i­cal change in Zim­babwe as of Novem­ber 2017. BSIG Inc is the one that has his­tor­i­cally de­rived ob­scene gains from the ar­bi­trage op­por­tu­nity of­fered by OMIR-ETF. This ETF fi­nan­cial derivate stemmed from the mul­ti­ple list­ing of the Old Mu­tual Plc share in Lon­don, Jo­han­nes­burg, Nairobi and Wind­hoek. Pro­fes­sor Steve Hanke of Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity and a fundi of the emerg­ing mar­kets at the neo-lib­eral Cato In­sti­tute had priv­i­leged knowl­edge of this ETF de­bauch­ery in global fi­nance which was be-knight­ing Zim­babwe. Hanke used to crow about his in­flu­ence on a former Gover­nor of the cen­tral bank in Harare. Af­ter the 2017 Novem­ber Glo­ri­ous Revo­lu­tion, he changed tack. He did not like Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube. It turned for good rea­son. He had the eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial tools that pierced this veil of way­ward con­duct in global fi­nan­cial man­age­ment by the Zim­babwe Govern­ment. The OMIR-ETF brought Zim­babwe down to its econ­omy knees through un­bri­dled cap­i­tal flight. Yet it could still not achieve the ZDERA sanc­tions goal of a ‘scream­ing’ econ­omy de­liv­er­ing po­lit­i­cal regime change. Zim­babwe turned out not to be the Chile of Sal­vador Al­lende in the 1970s. A strong State ap­pa­ra­tus kept the pop­u­lace in­su­lated through the off­set­ting land resti­tu­tion pro­gramme. It of­fered the so­cial safety vest of an in­for­mal econ­omy. The other saviour was the high hu­man re­source in­dex of Zim­babwe, again owed to the same State ap­pa­ra­tus be­got of the 1970s na­tional lib­er­a­tion war. Mo­bile money woes The na­tional eco­nomic as­sault from the OMIR-ETF de­riv­a­tive ac­quired a new ally in the emer­gence of a dom­i­nant player in the new era of dig­i­tal cur­rency. An ab­sence of a req­ui­site reg­u­la­tory frame­work through both ig­no­rant com­mis­sion and wil­ful com­mis­sion cre­ated a véri­ta­ble Wild West in the bank­ing and mon­e­tary do­main. The mo­bile money plat­form mor­phed into a den of thiev­ery, ex­tor­tion, money laun­der­ing and out­right ex­tor­tion. The en­su­ing mon­e­tary malfea­sance went on to strike at the heart of the con­sum­ing pop­u­lace. Un­doubt­edly, there was glee that the peo­ple could fi­nally be di­vorced from their ZANU PF party of the revo­lu­tion. That is why so much was banked into the suc­cess of the July 31, 2020 up­ris­ing. Peo­ple’s anger was to be fed by a re­turn to the 2008 hy­per­in­fla­tion. This time the twin evils of OMIR-ETF de­riv­a­tive and whole­sale abuse of the mo­bile money plat­form were slated to fo­ment pub­lic outrage against the Govern­ment of His Ex­cel­lency Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa. Both ZSE and EcoCash had di­a­bol­i­cally usurped the statu­tory role of the RBZ as sole na­tional mon­e­tary au­thor­ity. Lit­tle did the would-be neme­sis of the Head of State re­alise that he had strate­gi­cally ar­ranged a pha­lanx of tools to counter their do-or-die on­slaught. As July 31, 2020 ap­proached with its her­alded may­hem, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa un­leashed the first vol­ley. He al­lowed trad­ing in the US dol­lar. That took away the pres­sure of in­fla­tion from the Zim-dol­lar, which was un­der at­tack. He also loos­ened US dol­lar re­ten­tion by the cen­tral bank. Sud­denly small to medium gold pro­duc­ers, to­bacco and cot­ton farm­ers had so much buy­ing power in hard cur­rency. The other mas­ter­stroke was the pub­li­ca­tion of a statu­tory in­stru­ment that de­liv­ered blows on the un­godly twins of the OMIR-ETF de­riv­a­tive and the EcoCash mo­bile money agents. The coup de grace was the launch of the Dutch auc­tion on a new for­eign ex­change mar­ket. Now go­ing to the week 10, the RBZ auc­tion has since been broad­ened to in­clude small busi­nesses. High­way to suc­cess The Zim­babwe eco­nomic man­age­ment “Dream Team” of the His Ex­cel­lency Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa — Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube as the Min­is­ter of Fi­nance and Dr John Man­gudya as Gover­nor of the Re­serve Bank of Zim­babwe — is en route to de­liver a game-chang­ing eco­nomic mir­a­cle. Re­lieved and de­lighted top busi­ness moguls are gush­ing ac­co­lades on the Pres­i­dent. Right­fully so. He has ren­dered a jab that is a shot in the arm to the juices of en­trepreneur­ship. Pro­fes­sor Hanke has since gone quiet. No more gloat­ing ver­bal salvos against Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube. Dr John Man­gudya now has a new spring in his step. The Zim­babwe na­tion has co­a­lesced into gen­uine and sta­ble price dis­cov­ery. Par­ity pric­ing now reigns be­tween the Zam­bezi and the Lim­popo, be­tween the Kala­hari Desert and East­ern High­lands. Af­ter all, every cen­tral banker’s car­di­nal goal is to main­tain price sta­bil­ity. Zim­babwe has joined the global ranks of a ‘ nor­mal’ econ­omy for the first time. It is be­ing run on Adam Smith’s laws of sup­ply and de­mand. Re­quiem to the cor­po­rate colo­nial tem­plate and its band of ar­bi­trary al­lo­ca­tion. Eu­logy to a free mar­ket econ­omy that re­wards hard work, reaps profit to busi­ness acu­men and crowns risk with mouth-wa­ter­ing re­turns. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s mantra “Zim­babwe Is Open for Busi­ness” has ac­quired a po­tent and co­gent ex­pres­sion. Wel­come to on-ramp onto the high­way to the mid­dle-in­come sta­tus Zim­babwe by 2030. Sorry Chamisa, the dira jecharist. Zvakona! Mu­takura woton­akisa. Pity to Biti. EDM has gone so far as to rig the econ­omy. As for de­trac­tors and doom­say­ers, ZDERA sanc­tions now face a po­tent weapon in a nor­malised eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial land­scape. Cri­sis Coali­tion Zim­babwe, take heed, Naledi Pan­dor, the South African Min­is­ter of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and Co­op­er­a­tion, never men­tioned the C-word. Your years of cam­paign to place Zim­babwe on Chap­ter 7 of the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil has dis­mally flopped. SADC and the AU will not en­ter­tain the er­rant diplo­matic non­sense. Mean­while, the Zim­babwe Revo­lu­tion con­tin­ues to strive and thrive.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20150515,Prob­lem is Mu­gabe’s eco­nomic il­lit­er­acy,"UN­DOUBT­EDLY the best story of the week was the rev­e­la­tion in par­lia­ment that Zesa was dish­ing out US$10 mil­lion a year in free elec­tric­ity to its em­ploy­ees and for­mer em­ploy­ees. Ben­e­fi­cia­ries from the Min­istry of En­ergy and Power Devel­op­ment also en­joy the ex­emp­tion. The power util­ity’s work­ers and pen­sion­ers are en­ti­tled to US$160 worth of power a month. This came to light in hear­ings of the Zim­babwe Trans­mis­sion and Dis­tri­bu­tion Com­pany Ju­lian Chinem­biri giv­ing ev­i­dence to the Par­lia­men­tary Port­fo­lio Com­mit­tee on Mines and En­ergy. This once again il­lus­trates how public com­pa­nies have been re­duced to feed­ing troughs for cor­rupt and par­a­sitic el­e­ments. Ap­palling WE were par­tic­u­larly ap­palled by the front-page Her­ald slo­gan which read “So far so good” in re­la­tion to the coun­try’s progress since 1980. Read­ers con­tinue to draw at­ten­tion to the slo­gan which we pointed out a few weeks ago at the time of the In­de­pen­dence cel­e­bra­tions. It not only il­lus­trates that those be­hind it are de­tached from re­al­ity. So far so good when the coun­try is be­set by a nose­div­ing econ­omy, com­pany clo­sures, un­em­ploy­ment and grind­ing poverty? Pre­tence THE Her­ald re­ported on Mon­day that Rus­sia was pre­pared to thwart ag­gres­sion against Zim­babwe by the West. With zeal, Zanu PF’s daily pro­pa­ganda mouth­piece chron­i­cled how Rus­sia and China ve­toed the im­po­si­tion of sanc­tions on Zim­babwe by the United Na­tions in which Bri­tain and the US are iden­ti­fied as the main cul­prits. What the pub­li­ca­tion for­got to tell us is why Rus­sia de­layed open­ing its em­bassy in Zim­babwe af­ter we had gained In­de­pen­dence in 1980. Why would real friends take a long time to fully es­tab­lish them­selves in a coun­try which they helped dur­ing the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle? An easy an­swer could be that they were more aligned to Zapu than Zanu, but the broader pic­ture is they are less in­ter­ested in de­vel­op­ing the in­fra­struc­ture in this coun­try. Iron­i­cally, Pres­i­dent Robert Mu­gabe still ac­cuses the West of nail­ing Zim­babwe on its eco­nomic deathbed, claim­ing Rus­sia and China are all-weather friends, when in fact gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials are busy try­ing to re-en­gage West­ern coun­tries. It shows he is run­ning a dys­func­tional gov­ern­ment. Empty prom­ises ISN’T this a re­al­i­sa­tion that th­ese so-called friends of Zim­babwe have noth­ing much to of­fer ex­cept prom­ises that hardly come to fruition? Mu­gabe at­tended Rus­sia’s 70th an­niver­sary of the de­feat of the Nazis and held a meet­ing with Vladimir Putin in which sev­eral deals are re­port­edly on the cards. How­ever, we wait to see if any of th­ese will be im­ple­mented. Mu­gabe seems to take pride in the fact that the two coun­tries have sanc­tions im­posed on them while at the same time pre­tend­ing to be blind to the re­stric­tions that are sup­pos­edly hurt­ing the econ­omy and af­fect­ing the liveli­hoods of the ma­jor­ity of or­di­nary Zim­bab­weans. The Her­ald quoted Mu­gabe as hav­ing said; “You’ve sanc­tions, and we’ve sanc­tions too. That’s why we re­main united, and why we cel­e­brate with you. We need your sup­port.” Mu­gabe still can­not re­alise that the eco­nomic tail­spin and ser­vice de­liv­ery fail­ures in the coun­try need no grand­stand­ing. Meet­ing with Putin doesn’t change any­thing. What the na­tion needs are prag­matic and sound poli­cies that can at­tract the now scarce for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment rather than glo­be­trot­ting. And we in­sist this can only hap­pen when Mu­gabe goes. Ram­bling STILL on the Her­ald, Muck­raker’s good friend Tichaona Zin­doga (The Lone Ranger) — a dis­mal pro­pa­gan­dist who writes dreary opin­ions not to shed some in­sight on is­sues but to please his masters — was at it again this week fir­ing wickedly funny pot­shots at South African am­bas­sador to Zim­babwe Vusi Mav­im­bela for al­legedly ad­mir­ingly drawing par­al­lels be­tween his coun­try and the United States (as if it’s a crime if it were true), and at­tack­ing Zanu PF’s indi­geni­sa­tion pol­icy. Read­ing through Zin­doga’s de­press­ingly medi­ocre piece it was clear he didn’t know when, where and be­fore whom Mav­im­bela de­liv­ered his speech. Most im­por­tantly he sim­ply didn’t know the con­text. Oth­er­wise, how would he write such a dumb ar­ti­cle claim­ing Mav­im­bela was drawing par­al­lels be­tween South Africa and the US paint­ing a pic­ture they were like heaven when his speech was ac­tu­ally based on the phi­los­o­phy of W.E.B Du Bois, an African-Amer­i­can so­ci­ol­o­gist, his­to­rian, civil rights ac­tivist, Pan-African­ist, au­thor and edi­tor? Be­sides, when Mav­im­bela said South Africa re­mains Africa’s most de­vel­oped and di­ver­si­fied econ­omy (which is true), he was ex­plain­ing why im­mi­grants flock to the coun­try not say­ing it’s heaven. Not even the US is an El Do­rado. There is no coun­try on earth which is like the Gar­den of Eden. Fur­ther Mav­im­bela never at­tacked Zim­babwe’s indi­geni­sa­tion pol­icy; he was merely say­ing im­mi­grants are in­volved in all sec­tors of South Africa’s econ­omy and thus xeno­pho­bic ten­sions at the sub­al­tern lev­els among the poor be­cause there are no en­try bar­ri­ers or pro­hi­bi­tions like in other coun­tries since it’s a free mar­ket econ­omy in a demo­cratic and free so­ci­ety. So what’s wrong with that? Why does Zin­doga think he was only re­fer­ring to Zim­babwe when many other African coun­tries have sim­i­lar poli­cies? This shows the dan­gers of peo­ple writ­ing opin­ions or com­ment­ing on is­sues with­out con­text or back­ground. In fact, it shows the prob­lem of com­ment­ing on is­sues from a po­si­tion of spec­u­la­tion or ig­no­rance. (Read Mav­im­bela’s full speech on Page 14).",津巴布韦
zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20170507,The African nov­el­ist as a cul­tural spy,"The work of spies and in­form­ers has not al­ways been com­monly re­garded as a de­cent pro­fes­sion or a no­ble vo­ca­tion. Spies and in­form­ers are as­so­ci­ated with theft of in­for­ma­tion, es­pi­onage and po­lit­i­cal sur­veil­lance. It is for that rea­son that when Nige­rian in­tel­lec­tual Okello Oculi ar­gued in the year 2000 that African novelists should spy for Africa his mes­sage was re­ceived, in some cir­cles with sus­pi­cion and in oth­ers with pure con­tempt and anger, very lit­tle sober at­ten­tion was paid to the spirit of his mes­sage. Oculi was sim­plis­ti­cally un­der­stood to be per­suad­ing African novelists to pros­ti­tute their oth­er­wise hon­oured vo­ca­tion for the slip­pery busi­ness of peep­ing and spy­ing toms. A closer and much more char­i­ta­ble read­ing of Oculi’s lec­ture which he later pub­lished as a much wa­tered down es­say shows that he said noth­ing rad­i­cally new from what such African novelists as Ayi Kwei Armah, Chinua Achebe and Sem­bene Ous­mane had al­ready said about the work and vo­ca­tion of the nov­el­ist in African com­mu­ni­ties and so­ci­ety. For a con­ti­nent bur­dened with a history of colo­nial­ism, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural im­pe­ri­al­ism, the work of the novelists and other imag­in­ists can­not be sim­ply that of en­ter­tain­ers and myth mak­ers. In full ap­pre­ci­a­tion of that im­por­tant bur­den be­fore the African nov­el­ist in the trou­bled con­ti­nent, Oculi’s ges­ture was that African writ­ers should write back to Em­pire, de­ploy their stories and imag­i­na­tive nar­ra­tives to counter the myths and fic­tions that colo­nial­ists and im­pe­ri­al­ists writ­ers had con­cocted and spread about the con­ti­nent and its peo­ples. What pro­voked the con­tro­ver­sial but im­por­tant wish that African writ­ers should sur­vey world cul­tures, un­der­stand hu­man­ity and present a fair and in­formed view of Africa and Africans in the world was the de­hu­man­i­sa­tion of blacks and Africans that Oculi wit­nessed as a univer­sity stu­dent trav­el­ling in the United King­dom, the United States of Amer­ica and the Caribbean where he ob­served blacks and Africans to be per­pet­ual ob­jects and sus­pects in a hu­mil­i­at­ing and much un­friendly world. Oculi felt that African writ­ers, par­tic­u­larly the novelists as story tell­ers had the po­ten­tial to throw into world cir­cu­la­tion bet­ter and much more em­pow­er­ing images and imag­i­na­tions of Africa and the Africans. After the Spies of Em­pire The call to arms that Okello Oculi gives to African novelists is against Euro­pean and Amer­i­can novelists, travel writ­ers and jour­nal­ists who came to Africa as tourists and pro­duced lit­er­a­ture that mis­rep­re­sented Africa and Africans in western au­di­ences. Not only the western novelists, travel writ­ers and jour­nal­ists prac­tised this mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion of Africa and the African but also in­tel­lec­tual tourists, his­to­ri­ans and an­thro­pol­o­gists came to briefly sur­vey Africa and in no time pro­duced lengthy nar­ra­tives about the con­ti­nent and its peo­ple, nar­ra­tives that west­ern­ers re­lied on as au­thor­i­ta­tive knowl­edge of Africa and the Africans. Part of the coloni­sa­tion and dom­i­na­tion of Africa was in how it be­came a site and a place that was eas­ily know­able, sim­ple and open for ex­plor­ers, ex­perts and Em­pire builders from the West. In a sad but strong way, what western publics and au­di­ences came to know about Africa and the Africans was a mere racist and colo­nial rep­re­sen­ta­tion of the con­ti­nent and its peo­ple. Up to this day stu­dents of rep­re­sen­ta­tion it­self still note how Ba­yard Tay­lor’s 1853 por­trait of China and the Chi­nese peo­ple as prim­i­tive and strange still guides pop­u­lar western views and sen­ti­ments on China and its many peo­ple, even as China is prov­ing to be a for­mi­da­ble eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural world civil­i­sa­tion. A spe­cial cor­re­spon­dent of The Los An­ge­les Times, for in­stance, Amer­i­can jour­nal­ist David Lamb in the 1970s spent only four years in Africa in­ter­view­ing po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, ob­serv­ing guer­rilla move­ments, in­ter­act­ing with aca­demics, wit­ness­ing coups and talk­ing to witch­doc­tors, in his claim, and after that brief so­journ, he had enough au­thor­ity to write The Africans, a cru­elly hate­ful, prej­u­diced and racist nar­ra­tive about Africa and the Africans that en­joys best­selling sta­tus and oc­cu­pies top draw­ers in western li­braries as an im­por­tant re­source ma­te­rial for any re­searcher on Africa and the Africans. One of the telling wis­doms of this con­ceited book is that be­cause of war, poverty and dis­ease, “in Africa one does not re­ally need to grow old, the se­cret is to be ten years old,” and one would have lived a full life. Mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion does not only re­main at the level of cul­tural im­pe­ri­al­ism, racism and ori­en­tal­ism but it has se­ri­ous his­tor­i­cal, eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal con­se­quences. Amer­i­can author, Robert Kaplan’s in­flu­en­tial but dan­ger­ous es­say that ap­peared in The At­lantic in 1994 rep­re­sented the Global South as the start­ing point of “how scarcity, crime, over­pop­u­la­tion, trib­al­ism and dis­ease are rapidly de­stroy­ing the social fab­ric of our planet.” Typ­i­cal of colo­nial­ist, racist and im­pe­ri­al­ist mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tions, Kaplan did not bother to in­ves­ti­gate the colo­nial and im­pe­rial ori­gins of the de­cay in Africa and the Global South at large. Vic­tims of the crimes of slav­ery and colo­nial­ism are in­tel­li­gently mis­rep­re­sented as the crim­i­nals and the cul­prits who en­dan­ger life and progress in the planet by sup­pos­edly learned and so­phis­ti­cated spies of Em­pire that en­joy the epis­temic priv­i­lege of front page cov­er­age in elite publi­ca­tions. Writ­ings such as those of David Lamb and Robert Kaplan are re­lied upon, not only by tourists and cul­tural ex­plor­ers in the West, but eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal pol­icy mak­ers in gov­ern­ments know Africa and Africans as rep­re­sented by lit­er­ary and aca­demic tourists. Colo­nial and racist poli­cies that were im­ple­mented by colo­nial ad­min­is­tra­tors were in a strong way in­formed and shaped by the rep­re­sen­ta­tions of Africa and Africans that such novelists as the Bri­tish-Pol­ish writer Joseph Con­rad pro­duced about Africans as ob­jects and an­i­mals. Em­pire has for cen­turies re­lied on myth­i­cal and fic­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tions of the con­quered for its jus­ti­fi­ca­tion of their con­quest and de­hu­man­i­sa­tion. Mah­mood Mam­dani has ren­dered this ef­fec­tively in his 2013 pub­li­ca­tion by the same ti­tle that Em­pire’s big­gest weapon was re­ally not to di­vide and rule but to “De­fine and Rule”, a rep­re­sen­ta­tion and a def­i­ni­tion of the na­tive is con­structed that makes his coloni­sa­tion and dom­i­na­tion make per­fect sense. In gath­er­ing and fab­ri­cat­ing toxic rep­re­sen­ta­tions of Africans, Euro­pean and Amer­i­can novelists, jour­nal­ists, an­thro­pol­o­gists and other spies of Em­pire did and still do the cul­tural home­work that per­mits im­pe­ri­al­ism and all its poi­sonous ac­com­pa­ni­ments. Where the im­age of the con­quered is con­structed to jus­tify con­quest, the power, cul­ture and the im­age of the con­queror is mys­ti­fied and pre­sented in su­pe­rior terms. The cul­ture of the coloniser in the de­scrip­tion of Homi Bhabha be­came a col­lec­tion of arte­facts and “signs” that were “taken for won­ders” and their se­duc­tion and pow­er­ful per­sua­sion over­whelmed the colonised who took to the life world of the con­queror the way the prover­bial duck takes to wa­ter. The Bat­tle of Images and Imag­i­na­tions There is no doubt that in per­suad­ing African novelists to do cul­tural spy work Okello Oculi meant to cause con­tro­versy. He un­der­stood his au­di­ence to be that of im­age mak­ers and imag­in­ists for whom such provoca­tive and con­tro­ver­sial metaphors are the stock in trade. The mean­ing of Oculi’s mes­sage how­ever, is much heav­ier and more im­por­tant than the con­tro­versy that it caused. The world that we live in is not only en­gulfed is the “clash” of po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic “civil­i­sa­tions” but also a cul­tural and even spir­i­tual bat­tle of images and imag­i­na­tions. Oculi might have been ad­dress­ing African novelists, their cousins the poets and the drama­tists but his mes­sage ex­pands to African in­tel­lec­tu­als and other cul­tural and in­for­ma­tion work­ers, schol­ars, jour­nal­ists and movie mak­ers. The need to write back to Em­pire, to ex­plode the myths and fic­tions that have been con­structed about Africa and Africans is a se­ri­ous in­tel­lec­tual, cul­tural and spir­i­tual vo­ca­tion for all those in the Global South that trade in the pro­duc­tion and cir­cu­la­tion of in­for­ma­tion and ideas. It is no ex­ag­ger­a­tion that peo­ples and com­mu­ni­ties of the Global South are in re­al­ity who they have been imag­ined to be. The need for re-imag­ing and re-imag­i­na­tion of the so­ci­eties and peo­ples of the Global South can­not be a lux­ury but a grave re­spon­si­bil­ity. In a world where be­ing de­fined means be­ing ruled, the bat­tle for self-def­i­ni­tion is an im­por­tant lib­er­a­tion strug­gle, one that can­not be left to politi­cians and cul­tural ac­tivists alone.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160422,Mojo no sub­sti­tute for lack of pol­icy,"The me­dia have whipped them­selves into a frenzy, promis­ing the mother of all “sur­prises” by way of the Zim­babwe Peo­ple First. None have ma­te­ri­alised. We are now be­ing asked to wit­ness Ts­van­gi­rai’s “mojo”, ex­pect the mother and grand­mother of all demon­stra­tions. What are the pol­icy op­tions af­ter the demos? THERE is lit­tle doubt that Zim­bab­weans are be­ing primed for the 2018 gen­eral elec­tions. Go­ing by the noise ac­com­pa­ny­ing last week’s demon­stra­tions by the MDC-T in Harare, there are even hints th­ese protests might be de­signed to pre­cip­i­tate an early elec­tion. Lis­ten to Mor­gan Ts­van­gi­rai’s ad­dress to the de­mon­stra­tors; “Mu­gabe has no so­lu­tion to the cri­sis we are fac­ing be­cause he is tired. We are not de­mand­ing an over­throw of the Govern­ment, we are de­mand­ing a dig­ni­fied exit for tired Mu­gabe.” This is echoed by MDC-T sec­re­tary-gen­eral Dou­glas Mwon­zora; “This is not a demon­stra­tion for regime change, but about is­sues af­fect­ing or­di­nary peo­ple in the country. We are demon­strat­ing against poverty, against high un­em­ploy­ment and in­deed against cor­rup­tion.” Noth­ing ar­cane, no need for rocket sci­ence. Sim­ply to read, as they say, be­tween the lines. Which is not the same when it comes to what the party stands for. Amer­i­can elec­tions are noisy. They in­volve a lot of, if not, too much money. They grab global at­ten­tion. Af­ter all, Amer­ica is the global su­per­power, if a bul­ly­ing one. Which is why many, not only in Africa but Europe too, don’t re­ally love Amer­ica. Euro­peans have to suf­fer its ar­ro­gance be­cause of its pro­tec­tive shield against an imag­i­nary red ter­ror. So Amer­i­can elec­tions are too noisy to be ig­nored. In­volve too much money to THE Con­sti­tu­tion of the Repub­lic of Zim­babwe de­fines a youth as a per­son be­tween the ages of 15 and 35 years of age. This year as in­de­pen­dent Zim­babwe turned 36, the na­tion grad­u­ated its first set of youth from the born free era to adult­hood. Ar­ti­cle 20 in the Con­sti­tu­tion reads; “The State and all in­sti­tu­tions and agen­cies of Govern­ment at ev­ery level must take rea­son­able mea­sures . . . to en­sure that youths (a) have ac­cess to ap­pro­pri­ate ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, (b) have op­por­tu­ni­ties to as­so­ciate and to be rep­re­sented and par­tic­i­pate in po­lit­i­cal, so­cial, eco­nomic and other spheres of life; “(c) are af­forded op­por­tu­ni­ties for em­ploy­ment and other av­enues to eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment . . . ” Th­ese three pro­vi­sions among oth­ers un­der the same ar­ti­cle are an obli­ga­tion that the State has to the youth of Zim­babwe. As one cel­e­brated in­de­pen­dence this week, a ques­tion that came to mind was whether or not the State had ful­filled its obli­ga­tion to youths. If one were to in­quire of the first year of be matched. But there is one re­deem­ing fea­ture about Amer­i­can can­di­dates which Africa should be­gin to em­u­late even as new po­lit­i­cal par­ties mud­dle things up with the new rev­o­lu­tion­ary but il­lu­sory evan­ge­lism passed as democ­racy and hu­man rights. To a cer­tain ex­tent, Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates be­have like Zanu-PF. They state their po­si­tion on is­sues and make you hate them if you want. You are not left in doubt for too long about what it is they stand for or what they want or will do when they get into power. I am think­ing in par­tic­u­lar of one Don­ald Trump, the boor­ish straight talker the Repub­li­can Party have un­leashed on the Amer­i­can vot­ers. I can’t re­mem­ber how many coun­tries he has threat­ened to bomb out of ex­is­tence once he lands at the White House. He has told the Lati­nos his piece of mind, and how he would make them pay for the great wall be­tween their coun­tries and the United States of Amer­ica once he be­comes pres­i­dent. African Amer­i­cans have no il­lu­sions about where they stand in Trump’s es­teemed gaze. They have been kicked out of his cam­paign venues be­cause they don’t re­flect enough light. So af­ter a taste of power, im­po­tent though it was, un­der Barack Obama, they must know it would be back to the trenches if Amer­i­cans felt Trump was the best per­son to di­rect the af­fairs of their na­tion for the next four, if not eight, years. Fur­ther afield, Trump has promised, no, in fact, threat­ened, to roll back the shield of Amer­i­can pro­tec­tion over Ja­pan and South Korea or make them pay in full for it. His op­tion is that they arm them­selves and fight their own wars. In this epoch of nu­clear weapons! Our dear Lady Clin­ton has been no less clearer, mak­ing her­self as un­lady-like as they come in her elec­toral and for­eign pol­icy bel­liger­ence against na­tions deemed and judged by Amer­ica to pose a chal­lenge or “threat” to its hege­mony. Like Trump, she doesn’t like Iran. As the brains be­hind and mid­wife to Zidera, we know she doesn’t like the “threat” posed by Zim­babwe to Amer­ica. Lady Hil­lary Clin­ton wants to demon­strate to her Demo­cratic Party vot­ers that she is more man than Obama. This loop, dear reader, fo­cus­ing on Amer­i­can elec­tions and their pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates, has a sin­gle, sim­ple pur­pose: to show that when other na­tions talk of elec­tions they en­gage their brains be­fore they look for “mojo” to mask their lack of pol­icy or vi­sion. The par­ties and cam­paign­ers must have an idea to sell. To the con­trary, Zim­bab­weans are be­ing primed for a “much-an­tic­i­pated elec­tion” in 2018 whose most de­sir­able out­come is pred­i­cated on a me­dia-en­gi­neered coali­tion of the op­po­si­tion, but with­out solid pol­icy op­tions to vote for, only against, no prin­ci­ples to ad­vance but the cult of the in­di­vid­ual. You see, I have no rea­son to push a Zanu-PF pro­pa­ganda. There is a lot which is wrong in the party. Cor­rup­tion. Abuse of the land re­form pro­gramme and fail­ure to ac­count for re­sources al­lo­cated to the ben­e­fi­cia­ries. There is more, but every­thing which mat­ters is in the pub­lic do­main. The party’s 1001 ills are like a moun­tain which can’t be hid­den while those of the MDC-T its and soul-mates we can carry in a bas­ket. I am not a mem­ber of Zanu-PF, but when I look at the big­ger pic­ture of where Africa has come from, where it is to­day (the loot­ing of its re­sources and ma­nip­u­la­tion of its lead­ers and in­tel­li­gentsia by the West) and what Zanu-PF stands for de­spite the ve­nal­ity of its mem­bers and Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s vi­sion of an em­pow­ered so­ci­ety, I feel proudly African, not be­holden to some for­eign saviour. The new African De­vel­op­ment Bank pres­i­dent Ak­in­wumi Adesina al­most cap­tures the ideals which should in­spire any leader who wants to move us for­ward when he states: “I am driven con­stantly by a greater am­bi­tion for Africa. This can be a greater con­ti­nent. I want us to de­velop Africa with pride.” I don’t ex­pe­ri­ence the same ex­alt­ing spirit when I look into the op­po­si­tion bas­ket be­cause I can’t dis­cern a vi­sion in the noise and clut­ter. I don’t want to sound friv­o­lous, but Ts­van­gi­rai is a sea­soned politi­cian. He is not a prod­uct of the GNU or the MDC as it was formed in Septem­ber 1999. He had long be­fore then been an ac­tive Zanu-PF mem­ber or sup­porter. So he should know what he is talk­ing about. Not a novice any longer to be overly ex­cited in front of a crowd. And this is what he said of the ZRP in front of his ex­pec­tant, cheer­ing and ex­cited sup­port­ers on the day of the demon­stra­tion at Africa Unity Square on Thurs­day April 14; “This is how civilised po­lice of­fi­cers be­have in a demo­cratic country like Zim­babwe.” (Not like Amer­ica. Not like Bri­tain. Not like China or Rus­sia.) That is why he en­joys the free­dom to lead his move­ment for demo­cratic change in a demo­cratic country like Zim­babwe. The much-ma­ligned Posa has of­ten been mis­used or mis­ap­plied by the po­lice. The law re­quires those who want to hold a meet­ing only to “no­tify the reg­u­lat­ing au­thor­ity”; it doesn’t re­quire the po­lice to grant au­thor­ity for the meet­ing. This is what the court clar­i­fied, and the po­lice, alive to the rule of law, faith­fully obeyed and let the MDC-T pro­ceed with its demon­stra­tion. The po­lice were there purely to pro­tect life and prop­erty, not to in­tim­i­date or threaten any­one, as child­ishly claimed by the me­dia. Back to the vi­sion and pol­icy al­ter­na­tives. Zanu-PF can with­out doubt enu­mer­ate its own fail­ures. The op­po­si­tion and their me­dia have been very help­ful in this re­spect. No doubt they must have a huge jour­nal of who com­mit­ted what crime and when. But that is not enough to sell to me as a so­lu­tion to poverty, to cor­rup­tion, to in­com­pe­tence and medi­ocrity. That doesn’t re­veal to me a bet­ter to­mor­row, a prin­ci­pled lead­er­ship whose in­tegrity can with­stand ex­ter­nal ma­nip­u­la­tion and move this na­tion for­ward. The me­dia have whipped them­selves into a frenzy, promis­ing the mother of all “sur­prises” by way of the Zim­babwe Peo­ple First. None have ma­te­ri­alised. We are now be­ing asked to wit­ness Ts­van­gi­rai’s “mojo”, ex­pect the mother and grand­mother of all demon­stra­tions. What are the pol­icy op­tions af­ter the demos? The rea­son peo­ple can crit­i­cise or at­tack Zanu-PF poli­cies is be­cause we know them. Like them or hate them, that is your demo­cratic right. You can hate or love Trump or Clin­ton. That is be­cause you know what they stand for; the pol­icy and the vi­sion. In Zim­babwe we are be­ing asked to vote for peo­ple be­cause of their past in­juries fight­ing Zanu-PF! How many in­juries does Zanu-PF carry from the lib­er­a­tion war? So the country’s vi­sion must re­volve around a cult of past in­juries? Is that the best the lo­cal me­dia can of­fer the peo­ple of Zim­babwe as we pre­pare for the next elec­tions? Some ther­a­peu­tic mojo in­deed. Im­prov­ing the re­li­a­bil­ity and cov­er­age of en­ergy sys­tems is ab­so­lutely cru­cial for a suc­cess­ful in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion process that can fos­ter the growth of new in­dus­tries with mean­ing­ful value ad­di­tion. EN­ERGY in Africa is a scarcer com­mod­ity than in the de­vel­oped world. Fif­teen per­cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion lives on the African con­ti­nent, yet they rep­re­sent only 3 per­cent of global elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion. Elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion per capita in sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa is, on av­er­age, less than that needed to power a 50-watt light bulb con­tin­u­ously. The 48 sub-Sa­ha­ran coun­tries have a com­bined in­stalled gen­er­a­tion base of only 68 GW, ac­cord­ing to the African De­vel­op­ment Bank Group. This is roughly equal to the gen­er­a­tion ca­pac­ity of Spain, a country whose pop­u­la­tion is less than 5 per­cent of that of sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa. In 2011, the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity ini­ti­ated a drive to­wards achiev­ing uni­ver­sal ac­cess to mod­ern en­ergy ser­vices by 2030 un­der the UN’s Sus­tain­able En­ergy for All Ini­tia­tive ( SE4All). Sub­stan­tially in­creas­ing en­ergy ac­cess rates has the po­ten­tial to make a sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion to lift­ing peo­ple out of poverty, cre­at­ing more dig­ni­fied liv­ing con­di­tions and ex­pand­ing eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties. The cur­rent high level of en­ergy poverty across Africa un­der­mines the eco­nomic and so­cial de­vel­op­ment of the con­ti­nent. It can also fuel po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity and can even have an in­flu­ence upon the cre­ation of failed states. In­deed, world­wide there ap­pears to be a strong cor­re­la­tion be­tween po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and higher elec­tri­fi­ca­tion rates. His­tor­i­cally, ac­cess to, and util­i­sa­tion of mod­ern en­ergy tech­nolo­gies has played a huge role in the im­prove­ment of the qual­ity of life of hu­man be­ings. Much of hu­man ac­tiv­ity re­volves around se­cur­ing ad­e­quate, and ap­pro­pri­ate food and ac­cess­ing con­di­tions of ther­mal com­fort. Ac­cess to mod­ern en­ergy ser­vices (de­fined by the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency as house­hold ac­cess to elec­tric­ity and clean cook­ing fa­cil­i­ties) makes it much eas­ier for in­di­vid­ual house­holds to meet th­ese needs. They help in­di­vid­u­als to feed",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160604,Tourism key pil­lar of Zim econ­omy: Mzembi,"LC: Tell us about this con­fer­ence, the first of its kind, which you have just at­tended. WM: The con­fer­ence was or­gan­ised by the UN World Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion (UNWTO) and the govern­ment of the Peo­ple’s Re­pub­lic of China and run­ning un­der the theme: “Tourism for Peace and Devel­op­ment”. This was the first high-level meet­ing to ad­dress how tourism can con­trib­ute to the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment and its 17 uni­ver­sal goals. It brought to­gether more than 1 000 pub­lic and pri­vate rep­re­sen­ta­tives from over 107 coun­tries to dis­cuss tourism’s role in ad­vanc­ing the Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment Goals (SDGs), with a par­tic­u­lar fo­cus on tourism’s ca­pac­ity to fight poverty and build peace­ful so­ci­eties. The con­fer­ence had two ses­sions on the role of tourism in poverty al­le­vi­a­tion and the devel­op­ment agenda and on tourism and peace. I was in­vited in my ca­pac­ity as the cur­rent chair­per­son of the UNWTO Com­mis­sion for Africa and I was a pan­el­list on the ses­sion on tourism and peace. The ses­sion dis­cussed link­ages be­tween tourism and peace and ex­plored ways to make the sec­tor more peace sen­si­tive. It fur­ther dis­cussed op­por­tu­ni­ties and the way for­ward to en­sure that tourism can play an ef­fec­tive role in build­ing a cul­ture of peace. LC: What role can tourism play to bring global peace at a time the world seems to be grap­pling with sev­eral se­cu­rity is­sues? WM: Tourism has a nat­u­ral patent to soft power and it should be de­ployed in pub­lic and peo­ple-to-peo­ple diplo­macy. It is not hard power alone that will de­feat ter­ror­ism; it is com­ple­men­tary ac­tion from soft power that will ul­ti­mately win be­cause ter­ror­ism is con­ceived and trans­ported in the mind. It is an ide­o­log­i­cal mind­set and the cit­i­zen diplo­macy will over­whelm ter­ror be­cause you can­not ask seven bil­lion peo­ple to stay at home — 1,2 bil­lion peo­ple are al­ready part of the trav­el­ling rev­o­lu­tion. These num­bers will in­crease ex­po­nen­tially in the next decade con­sid­er­ing that in 1950 there were just 25 mil­lion in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers. The sheer force and eco­nomic im­pact of this in­dus­try and the mere prospect of delet­ing $7 tril­lion from the global bal­ance sheet brought through tourism will com­pel unity of pur­pose and en­gage­ment to this threat. LC: Do you think gov­ern­ments and other stake­hold­ers in the tourism in­dus­try are awake to this point? WM: We have not, as global tourism lead­er­ship, suf­fi­ciently un­packed the eco­nomic ar­gu­ment for pro­tect­ing this sec­tor. It is still viewed as an at­tack on some elit- ist life­styles. The United Na­tions Year on Tourism is, there­fore, an op­por­tu­nity to pitch safe, se­cure and seam­less travel at the high­est in­ter-gov­ern­men­tal level. None of us is safe from the scourge of ter­ror and, there­fore, an at­tack on hu­mankind, no mat­ter how ge­o­graph­i­cally re­mote or dis­tant, is an at­tack on us all. The ter­ror prob­lem is ram­pant and re­quires global so­lu­tions. It also should not just deal with out­comes and symp­toms, but go to the causes of what re­ally causes ter­ror. We must look crit­i­cally at cur­rent sources of ter­ror — that it is not a co­in­ci­dence that they ap­pear to be from col­lapsed states, aris­ing out of in­ter­ven­tions in in­ter­nal mat­ters of tar­geted regimes. There is a link also with the emerg­ing cur­rent refugee cri­sis in Europe. LC: Let’s look at the tourism sec­tor in Zim­babwe; it nearly col­lapsed due to con­fronta­tion be­tween the coun­try and West­ern coun­tries over land re­form poli­cies. WM: Yes, it is pub­lic knowl­edge that the decade lead­ing up to 2009, Zim­babwe vir­tu­ally ex-com­mu­ni­cated it­self from the UNWTO due to non-pay­ment of mem­ber­ship sub­scrip­tion as a re­sult of eco­nomic melt­down aris­ing after the fall­out with the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity over its agrar­ian re­form. In­fla­tion last recorded in De­cem­ber 2008 was in ex­cess of 240 mil­lion per­cent. The Zim­babwe dol­lar was in quadrillions to the US$ and the in­ter­na­tional me­dia on­slaught had vir­tu­ally col­lapsed the Zim­babwe brand. In Fe­bru­ary 2009, I was part of the Unity Govern­ment that was pre­scribed to the coun­try by the re­gion. I was im­me­di­ately drafted into the in­ter­na­tional re-en­gage­ment team and de­ployed to the de­bate on state diplo­macy. I im­me­di­ately recog­nised the peo­ple-to-peo­ple diplo­matic po­ten­tial of the tourism sec­tor and how it would un­der­write in­ter-state diplo­macy go­ing for­ward. LC: What did you do after re­al­is­ing you were be­ing faced by such a sit­u­a­tion? WM: The first task was reg­u­lar­i­sa­tion of our in­ter­nal mem­ber­ship to tourism or­gan­i­sa­tions, prin­ci­pally the UNWTO, World Travel and Tourism Coun­cil and Re­gional Tourism Or­gan­i­sa­tion of South­ern Africa (Re­tosa). Sec­ond, was an ex­er­cise to re­brand tourism that re­sulted in a clean bill of travel health by June 2009 and Ger­many was the first coun­try to lift travel ad­vi­sories fol­lowed by Europe and later on the United States and Japan. Third, was the in­te­gra­tion of Zim­bab­wean, global and re­gional tourism agenda set­ting which saw us elected to the ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil of the UNWTO 2009 to 2013 and suc­ces­sive chair­man­ship of Re­tosa, two time pres­i­dent of the African Travel As­so­ci­a­tion and now sec­ond time chair­per­son of the UNWTO Com­mis­sion for Africa. The ul­ti­mate des­ti­na­tion of this jour­ney in re­brand­ing of tourism was our own de­ci­sion backed by the con­vic­tion of a man whom we shall re­main per­ma­nently in­debted to — Mr Talib Re­fai — the cur­rent sec­re­tary gen­eral of the UNWTO. This was when the UNWTO unan­i­mously de­cided that the 20th ses­sion of the Gen­eral Assem­bly of the UNWTO should be a joint host­ing be­tween Zim­babwe and Zam­bia at the Vic­to­ria Falls. That be­came the high­est global en­dorse­ment of brand Zim­babwe and the rest is his­tory. LC: Hav­ing said all this min­is­ter, where are we now in tourism? WM: Tourism has re­cov­ered to a point where it is the lead­ing sec­tor ahead of agri­cul­ture, min­ing and man­u­fac­tur­ing in terms of sec­toral growth. In fact, it is cross sub­si­dis­ing the Zim­bab­wean econ­omy and Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct. Its con­tri­bu­tion now stands at 11 per­cent. Go­ing for­ward, it is pay­ing the bills for Govern­ment func­tions. Mean­while the world has sig­nif­i­cantly soft­ened stance to­wards Zim­babwe, with Euro­pean Union sanc­tions par­tially dropped and there is in­tense busi­ness re­con­nais­sance mis­sions into Zim­babwe and China would at­test to this. So, tourism has been the most sig­nif­i­cant rap­proche­ment and re-en­gage­ment tool for the Re­pub­lic of Zim­babwe and it is now an ac­knowl­edged uni­fy­ing force and a tool for pub­lic diplo­macy and the econ­omy has largely been sta­bilised by its re­ceipts in­come, se­cur­ing peace in the process. LC: The ses­sion you par­tic­i­pated in as a pan­el­list at the First World Con­fer­ence on Tourism for Devel­op­ment was on tourism and peace. How did tourism man­age to se­cure peace for Zim­babwe? WM: The last bul­let fired by Zim­babwe in a war sit­u­a­tion was in 1979. In Rhode­sia, there was no sub­stan­tial tourism to talk about be­cause of the war and con­di­tions that pre­vailed. Un­for­tu­nately, fol­low­ing the in­cep­tion of our land and agrar­ian re­form, the re­sponse of a sec­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity cre­ated near sim­i­lar con­di­tions to those that pre­vailed pre-1980 for tourism — sim­i­lar to war con­di­tions. The re­sponse in it­self by the sec­tion of the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity was a failure of diplo­macy. When State diplo­macy fails, even with­out guns be­ing fired at times, it can in­vent con­di­tions equiv­a­lent to those of a war zone. And usu­ally tra­di­tional diplo­macy fails be­cause of ego. It fails be­cause of rec­i­proc­ity; be­cause tra­di­tional diplo­macy some­times in­vokes an eye for an eye. But an eye for an eye leaves the world blind. Tra­di­tional diplo­macy is also some­times char­ac­terised by re­tal­i­a­tion. It fails be­cause it is char­ac­terised by those three el­e­ments. We must never al­low a sit­u­a­tion where after tra­di­tional diplo­macy fails it pre­cip­i­tates war be­fore we in­voke the in­her­ent diplo­matic char­ac­ter­is­tics of tourism. Tourism must come to the res­cue and not it­self to be a vic­tim of col­lat­eral dam­age aris­ing out of the failure of State diplo­macy. Tourism has be­come a pub­lic diplo­macy tool and that type of diplo­macy ac­tu­ally works. In tourism, we should patent soft power, the abil­ity to em­brace the di­ver­sity that comes from tourism. Tourism is pub­lic diplo­macy which is char­ac­terised by wealth cre­ation. When peo­ple ar­rive in des­ti­na­tions, they are agents of good­will. Usu­ally they bring an olive branch, so to­day’s 1,2 bil­lion global ar­rivals can eas­ily be turned into peace am­bas­sadors of this world. The ex­pen­di­ture that they gen­er­ate in des­ti­na­tions cre­ates tourism economies. LC: How did you apply this soft power diplo­macy of tourism in Zim­babwe and were the re­sults favourable? WM: In the very early stages of my de­ploy­ment, I re­alised that tourism was a force for the good and we lever­aged on it to trans­form a $2,94 mil­lion econ­omy in 2009 to just over a bil­lion in 2015. Be­cause I in­her­ited (as Min­is­ter of Tourism and Hos­pi­tal­ity In­dus­try) so much ad­ver­sity aris­ing out of sanc­tions, dis­en­gage­ment and iso­la­tion of a des­ti­na­tion, I turned this neg­a­tive stock that I in­her­ited into an op­por­tu­nity. The first thing is that I looked at the flip side of the neg­a­tive pub­lic­ity and con­cluded that there was no­body in the world who did not know Zim­babwe be­cause it was in the press daily for one rea­son or an­other. CNN, BBC, Sky News and all the major print me­dia abroad cov­ered the coun­try for one rea­son or an­other al­most on a daily ba­sis. I said: “How do I pro­ceed with this neg­a­tive stock?” The first thing is, I said not­with­stand­ing the neg­a­tiv­ity, there was a start­ing point and that start­ing point was that no per­son in the world could claim that they didn’t know Zim­babwe and where it was. The next thing was to re­brand, which meant ba­si­cally turn­ing that neg­a­tive stereo­type into an op­por­tu­nity. How did I pro­ceed with it? — through re-en­gage­ment. Tourism min­is­ters did not im­pose travel warn­ings on each other and they are nor­mally very good nur­tured peo­ple. Travel ad­vi­sories are im­posed on na­tion States by for­eign of­fices. It was im­por­tant, there­fore, for tourism min­is­ters to en­gage the right au­di­ence. LC: The re-en­gage­ment seemed a very dif­fi­cult task con­sid­er­ing that the peo­ple you were tar­get­ing al­ready held their own views on Zim­babwe. What strate­gies did you use to win their hearts? WM: I said we must de­velop very close work­ing re­la­tion­ships with the se­cu­rity sec­tors and the min­istries of For­eign Af­fairs. And even as we go out to en­gage, these are the same agents that we must pos­si­bly en­gage in those coun­tries up to in­clud­ing Heads of States and Gov­ern­ments be­cause that’s where con­cep­tions about des­ti­na­tions and coun­tries are de­rived from. That’s why this In­ter­na­tional Year of Sus­tain­able Tourism Devel­op­ment be­comes a very clear op­por­tu­nity for us to be heard by the right peo­ple. It will ul­ti­mately re­sult in an au­di­ence for us by the Heads of State and Govern­ment at the UNWTO gen­eral assem­bly in 2017 here in China. We want to get there when our act is to­gether on what we want to sell and be un­der­stood on. Cre­ate a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing pro­file for tourism to func­tion bet­ter. There is hardly any Head of State in the world or a level higher than me that I have not en­gaged to plead for Zim­babwe’s case to be un­der­stood and it re­sulted in what we now claim as the clean travel bill of rights as far back as June 2009 be­cause we pitched our mes­sage to the right peo­ple. I met Hil­lary Clin­ton (then the United States Sec­re­tary of State), An­gela Merkel (the Ger­many Chan­cel­lor), Gor­don Brown (former Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter) - vir­tu­ally most of the lead­er­ship of the world - to ex­plain that not­with­stand­ing our state of fall­out, we should never al­low this peo­ple-to-peo­ple bridge to be col­lapsed. That was my mes­sage to the world of re-en­gage­ment and rap­proche­ment to the world lead­er­ship. It does not mat­ter how much of a fall­out na­tions States have, tourism is a peace sec­tor. It’s a pub­lic diplo­macy tool, which should not be col­lapsed. LC: Now that the tourism sec­tor seems to be on its way to full re­cov­ery, what will guar­an­tee its sur­vival in the fu­ture? WM: Any­thing in a Govern­ment that is eco­nom­i­cally sig­nif­i­cant is en­abled, fa­cil­i­tated and pro­tected. We ad­vanced tourism in Zim­babwe to a point where it is now a recog­nised eco­nomic pil­lar. That we were able to ad­vance to that point of recog­ni­tion means that the whole govern­ment works for its ad­vance­ment. It starts with the se­cu­rity sec­tor guar­an­tee­ing peace be­cause peace is a crit­i­cal suc­cess fac­tor. First and fore­most as Zim­babwe, our first prod­uct is peace. It does not mat­ter how at­trac­tive a des­ti­na­tion is, if it is si­t­u­ated in a con­flict sit­u­a­tion it doesn’t sell. Tourism can­not sell con­flict. We are even con­fi­dent to a point where we have crafted a 5-5-152020 vi­sion. In­ter­preted to mean to­wards a $5 bil­lion tourism growth from five mil­lion ar­rivals con­tribut­ing 15 per­cent to GDP by year 2020.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160921,Pres­i­dent to ad­dress UN to­day,"THE Se­cu­rity Coun­cil is in dan­ger of be­com­ing in­creas­ingly in­ef­fi­cient and il­le­git­i­mate if it is not ur­gently re­formed, United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Mr Ban Ki-Moon, has said. Mr Ban said this as he of­fi­cially opened the 71st Ses­sion of the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly here yes­ter­day. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe and other world lead­ers were in New York as Mr Ban opened the global or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Grand De­bate for the last time, with world lead­ers ex­pected to se­lect his suc­ces­sor after 10 years at the helm of the world body. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe — who has con­sis­tently led calls for the re­form of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and democrati­sa­tion of the UN sys­tem — was ac­com­pa­nied to New York by First Lady Amai Grace Mu­gabe, Min­is­ters Sim­barashe Mum­bengegwi (For­eign Af­fairs) and Dr Wal­ter Mzembi (Tourism and Hos­pi­tal­ity In­dus­try) and se­nior Govern­ment of­fi­cials. The Zim­bab­wean leader is ex­pected to ad­dress the Gen­eral Assem­bly and make his con­tri­bu­tion to the Grand De­bate to­day. Yes­ter­day, Mr Ban echoed Zim­babwe and Africa’s calls for changes to the main or­gans of the UN, namely the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil and the Gen­eral Assem­bly. “Some­times we are our own worst en­e­mies. Mem­ber states have still not agreed on a for­mula for re­form of the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil — a con­tin­u­ing risk to its ef­fec­tive­ness and le­git­i­macy. “In the same spirit, I want to put on the ta­ble to­day a ma­jor and much needed re­form for fair­ness and ef­fec­tive­ness in the United Na­tions. Far too of­ten, I have seen widely-sup­ported pro­pos­als blocked in the name of con­sen­sus by a few, or some­times even just one coun­try. We see this be­ing done by large and small coun­tries alike. Time and again, I have seen es­sen­tial ac­tion and good ideas blocked in the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. Blocked in the Gen­eral Assem­bly. Blocked in the bud­get process. Blocked in the Con­fer­ence on Dis­ar­ma­ment and other bod­ies. “Is it fair in this com­pli­cated 21st cen­tury for any one coun­try, or a few coun­tries, to yield such dis­pro­por­tion­ate power and hold the world hostage on so many im­por­tant is­sues? Con­sen­sus should not be con­fused with una­nim­ity. The global pub­lic is right to ask whether this is how an or­gan­i­sa­tion in which we have in­vested so much hope and as­pi­ra­tions should func­tion,” he said. Mr Ban also slammed at­tempts to un­der­mine the in­de­pen­dence of the UN Sec­re­tariat. Since for­ma­tion in 1945, the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil’s per­ma­nent mem­bers with the power to veto just about any in­ter­na­tional de­ci­sion have been Bri­tain, China, France, Rus­sia and the United States. Africa’s core po­si­tion — as car­ried in the Ezul­wini Con­sen­sus and the Sirte Dec­la­ra­tion — is for the con­ti­nent to have at least two per­ma­nent rep­re­sen­ta­tives on the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, and that should veto power be re­tained in the re­struc­tured or­gan, that same power must be given to Africa’s two mem­bers as well. At yes­ter­day’s Gen­eral Assem­bly ses­sion, Mr Ban also said that the 17 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals and Paris Agree­ment on Cli­mate Change pro­vided the roadmap to bet­ter­ment of the hu­man con­di­tion, and all coun­tries should fully sub­scribe to the ideals con­tained in the two key doc­u­ments. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s Govern­ment is a solid backer of both the SDGs and Paris Agree­ment. Mr Ban said, “. . . after ten years in of­fice, I am more con­vinced than ever that we have the power to end war, poverty and per­se­cu­tion. We have the means to pre­vent con­flict. We have the po­ten­tial to close the gap be­tween rich and poor, and to make rights real in peo­ple’s lives. “With the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals, we have a man­i­festo for a bet­ter fu­ture. With the Paris Agree­ment on Cli­mate Change, we are tack­ling the defin­ing chal­lenge of our time. We have no time to lose. I urge you, lead­ers, to bring the Paris Agree­ment into force be­fore the end of this year.” Mem­bers of the UN are in the process of find­ing a suc­ces­sor to the South Korean diplo­mat, and in­di­ca­tions are that the next Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral will hail from Eastern Europe, and this could be the first time the or­gan­i­sa­tion is headed by a woman.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190529,Young en­trepreneurs prove met­tle in busi­ness,"Ac­cord­ing to the African Union’s Roadmap on Har­ness­ing the De­mo­graphic Div­i­dend Through In­vest­ments in Youths, there is need to de­velop and im­ple­ment strate­gies aim­ing at re­duc­ing the pro­por­tion of 2013 youth un­em­ploy­ment by at least a quar­ter by 2024 (in ac­cor­dance with Agenda 2063 First 10 Year Im­ple­men­ta­tion Plan). FRANK MOYO (31) is a car­pen­ter at Glen View In­dus­trial Com­plex in Harare. In his small space, he makes fur­ni­ture that in­cludes chairs, stools, so­fas, beds, head­boards and dress­ing ta­bles among other things. He em­ploys four young car­pen­ters aged 18, 20, 21 and 28. Each month he gets orders from as far as Masvingo. Some of his clients are sourced through an ac­tive What­sApp group in which he posts pic­tures of what he makes. “I trained all the four peo­ple I work with. Most of them were un­em­ployed be­fore they joined my team. Their earn­ings vary, but I am happy that they can now take care of themselves and their fam­i­lies,” he said He started his small busi­ness us­ing a loan ob­tained from a mi­cro-credit fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion. “I have re­paid my loan and now mak­ing a profit. If youths get op­por­tu­ni­ties, we can grow our busi­nesses and leap out of poverty. We can also em­ploy other youths,” he said. Most of his clients are in ur­ban ar­eas and busi­ness has been good over the past six years. He says his busi­ness has cre­ated a chain value as other young busi­nesses In Seke ru­ral, Mrs Bless­ing Mu­ty­oza (33) grows green leafy veg­eta­bles, toma­toes, onions and pota­toes for re­sale in Chi­tung­wiza. Her fam­ily of five has been sur­viv­ing on this for the past 12 years. She now wants to grow her busi­ness and start a poul­try project, but says she does not know how to go about it. “I sell veg­eta­bles in Chi­tung­wiza twice a week. I use the money I get to pay fees for my chil­dren, buy clothes and food. “I want to move into poul­try and not sure if I qual­ify for a loan,” she said. In Harare’s cen­tral busi­ness dis­trict (CBD), Ms Tariro Sa­mukange (33), a mother of two owns a tai­lor­ing busi­ness and em­ploys three peo­ple. She makes cur­tains and bed cov­ers and also says busi­ness has been good. She has also been train­ing up­com­ing tai­lors and hopes her busi­ness will grow. “I started sewing in col­lege. Af­ter grad­u­at­ing, I started the busi­ness with money from a sav­ings group with my friends. We were five and a per­son would re­ceive up to US$1 000 when their turn came. “Be­cause of dis­ci­pline, I grew my busi­ness which I started from home. I am now rent­ing a room in the CBD and hope to own a fac­tory one day. My chil­dren are all in school and I can earn a de­cent liv­ing,” she said. She is one of the many Zim­bab­wean youths who have cre­ated em­ploy­ment for their peers, erad­i­cat­ing ex­treme poverty. Such young en­trepreneurs have also proved that youths can con­trib­ute to the coun­try’s eco­nomic growth if given op­por­tu­ni­ties. Africa is home to the fastest-grow­ing and most youth­ful pop­u­la­tion in the world. Ac­cord­ing to the African Devel­op­ment Bank (AfDB), over 40 per­cent are un­der the age of 15 and 20 per­cent are be­tween the ages of 15 and 24. Over 65 per­cent of Zim­babwe’s pop­u­la­tion is youth and this makes them a group of con­cern tak­ing the coun­try’s fu­ture into con­sid­er­a­tion. With this change in de­mo­graph­ics comes more work­ing-age in­di­vid­u­als and thus the po­ten­tial to ad­vance eco­nomic growth and sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, known as the de­mo­graphic div­i­dend. De­mo­graphic div­i­dend refers to the growth in an econ­omy that is the re­sul­tant ef­fect of a change in the age struc­ture of a coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion. The change in age struc­ture is typ­i­cally brought on by a de­cline in fer­til­ity and mor­tal­ity rates. As fer­til­ity de­clines, the pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion that is of work­ing age in­crease rel­a­tive to the pro­por­tion of the pop­u­la­tion that is very old and very young. If this pe­riod co­in­cides with a broad­based and sig­nif­i­cant in­vest­ment in human cap­i­tal con­cen­trated from youth to adult­hood, along with op­por­tu­ni­ties in the labour mar­ket, the re­sult is a boost in eco­nomic growth and pros­per­ity in the pop­u­la­tion. This al­lows the coun­try to ef­fec­tively in­vest in their health, ed­u­ca­tion and skills en­hance­ment for eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment through pub­lic ac­tion and pri­vate sec­tor in­volve­ment. In Zim­babwe, Gov­ern­ment has been do­ing a lot to har­ness the youth de­mo­graphic div­i­dend. Through the Youth Em­power Bank, youths have been re­ceiv­ing loans to start projects. The bank, which was launched by Gov­ern­ment last year to sup­port var­i­ous youth ini­tia­tives has to date reached out to more than 6 000 youths with po­ten­tial to set up vi­able busi­nesses. The Em­power Bank has dis­bursed loans worth $1 mil­lion out of the $4,1 mil­lion that has been set aside for fi­nanc­ing young busi­nesses across the coun­try. Loans that were ap­proved for the agri­cul­tural sec­tor and its value chain were the sig­nif­i­cant part of the bank’s loan book with more than $4,1 mil­lion un­der con­sid­er­a­tion for var­i­ous in­di­vid­ual clients, groups and as­so­ci­a­tions, with most of them un­der contract farm­ing for both crop and an­i­mal hus­bandry. Zim­babwe also has a Na­tional Youth Pol­icy, which is a crit­i­cal plan­ning tool guid­ing the coun­try’s ap­proach to youth devel­op­ment. The pol­icy doc­u­ment con­tains in­her­ent com­mit­ments by Gov­ern­ment, young Zim­bab­weans and so­ci­ety at large on in­ter­ven­tions and ser­vices that should be rolled out to en­sure youths no longer face the crip­pling chal­lenges be­set­ting them today. Zanu-PF sec­re­tary for Youth Af­fairs Cde Pupu­rai Tog­a­repi last week im­plored youths to fo­cus on re­build­ing the econ­omy through en­trepreneur­ship. “Zanu-PF’s main agenda is to in­vest in youths as they are the lead­ers of to­mor­row. You should be cham­pi­ons in var­i­ous en­trepreneur­ship skills so that our econ­omy will im­prove in ac­cor­dance with our Pres­i­dent’s vi­sion of be­com­ing an up­per mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030,” said Cde Tog­a­repi dur­ing a youth in­ter-dis­trict outreach in Mashona­land Cen­tral. “You (youths) are the ones re­spon­si­ble for re­build­ing the econ­omy. My visit to China was very cru­cial be­cause very soon in July, there is go­ing to be a team of ex­perts in en­trepreneur­ship who will teach our youths on self-suf­fi­ciency and be­come skilled in var­i­ous ar­eas; be it sewing, bak­ing and many more ideas.” He said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has set up cen­tres where youths were go­ing to be equipped with var­i­ous skills and given ma­chin­ery in line with trades of their choice. This is wel­come given that the de­mo­graphic div­i­dend re­mains cen­tral to re­al­is­ing Africa’s as­pi­ra­tion for eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion. In De­cem­ber last year, the Gov­ern­ment of Zim­babwe with sup­port from the United Na­tions Pop­u­la­tion Fund (UNFPA) launched find­ings of the De­mo­graphic Div­i­dend. Speak­ing at the launch, Min­is­ter of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube said: “More of­ten than not, when we speak on is­sues of eco­nomic growth, we pay less at­ten­tion to a crit­i­cal cog in the equa­tion, that is, the human cap­i­tal aspect. “To keep this per­spec­tive un­der fo­cus, in 2013 the African Union adopted the Ad­dis Ababa Dec­la­ra­tion on Pop­u­la­tion and Devel­op­ment in Africa be­yond 2014 un­der the theme “Har­ness­ing the De­mo­graphic Div­i­dend: The Fu­ture We Want.” Ac­cord­ing to the African Union’s Roadmap on Har­ness­ing the De­mo­graphic Div­i­dend Through In­vest­ments in Youths, there is need to de­velop and im­ple­ment strate­gies aim­ing at re­duc­ing the pro­por­tion of 2013 youth un­em­ploy­ment by at least a quar­ter by 2024 (in ac­cor­dance with Agenda 2063 First 10 Year Im­ple­men­ta­tion Plan). It also seeks to im­prove ac­cess to credit fa­cil­i­ties for youths and es­tab­lish and op­er­a­tionalise na­tional and re­gional youth funds to in­crease young peo­ple’s ac­cess to busi­ness cap­i­tal. The roadmap also en­cour­ages en­gage­ment with pri­vate sec­tor part­ners to ex­pand in­tern­ships, ap­pren­tice­ships and on-the-job train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for women and youths. It also seeks to de­velop proper poli­cies, in­cen­tive mea­sures and cre­ate con­duc­tive en­vi­ron­ment for cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­i­ties with the aim of sup­port­ing youth en­trepreneur­ship. Ac­cord­ing to the AU Roadmap, en­gag­ing African phi­lan­thropists, chiefs ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cers (CEOs) and pri­vate sec­tor to de­velop and sup­port trans­for­ma­tive youth devel­op­ment ini­tia­tives to­wards build­ing en­tre­pre­neur­ial skills and ca­pac­i­ties of African youths is vi­tal. The AU Roadmap also calls on en­hanc­ing ac­cess of young peo­ple to gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment and fi­nan­cial ser­vices, in­clud­ing special con­sid­er­a­tions for youth­led busi­nesses and mea­sures to re­duce the chal­lenge of start­ing and/or do­ing busi­ness within and across African coun­tries. “In­vest in sec­tors with high job-mul­ti­plier ef­fects, in­clud­ing in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy (ICT), man­u­fac­tur­ing, agri­cul­ture and agro in­dus­tries in or­der to gen­er­ate em­ploy­ment and spur in­clu­sive growth,” the AU Roadmap points out. It also calls for the cre­ation of youth devel­op­ment funds at na­tional, sub-re­gional (RECs) and con­ti­nen­tal level (AfDB) to sup­port youth en­trepreneur­ship ad­vance­ment within all sec­tors. With po­lit­i­cal sup­port and that of other sec­tors, youths can be­come cham­pi­ons in var­i­ous en­trepreneur­ship skills and im­prove Zim­babwe’s econ­omy. ◆ Feed­back: e-mail­rose­lyne.sa­chiti@zim­pa­pers.co.zw or rose­lyne.sa­chiti33@gmail.com Twit­ter @Rose­lyneSa­chiti",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20160427,ADVERTORIAL,"RU­RAL district coun­cils have been chal­lenged to take ad­van­tage of the country’s lead­ing trade ex­hi­bi­tions to mar­ket them­selves, Chivi Ru­ral District Coun­cil chair­per­son, Killer Zivhu, has said. Zivhu, who is at­tend­ing the Zim­babwe In­ter­na­tional Trade Fair in Bu­l­awayo, said the ZITF and the Harare Agri­cul­tural Show were per­fect op­por­tu­ni­ties for ru­ral coun­cils to ex­hibit and mar­ket them­selves. He said this would go a long way in ad­ver­tis­ing the busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­ist­ing in their dis­tricts and pos­si­bly at­tract part­ners who may help them de­velop their com­mu­ni­ties. “Next year, we would like to see all district coun­cils tak­ing part at ZITF. If we had our way, we would even ex­hibit twice at ZITF, first at a show for lo­cal com­pa­nies and then at one that would have the lo­cal con­cerns and for­eign ones ex­hibit­ing. ‘‘We would then fol­low it up with the Harare Agri­cul­tural Show in Au­gust,” said Zivhu. Zivhu said lo­cal au­thor­i­ties should do more than just draw­ing al­lowances for par­tic­i­pat­ing at the ZITF or Harare Agri­cul­tural Show. He said the na­tion would also get to ap­pre­ci­ate chal­lenges be­ing faced by dis­tricts and their suc­cesses. He said there were also arts and crafts to be ex­ported to the rest of the country and be­yond the borders. “The ex­hi­bi­tions are also an op­por­tu­nity for dis­tricts to pa­rade their arts and crafts to a wider mar­ket which in turn would ben­e­fit the peo­ple at grass­root level in line with the govern­ment’s ex­pec­ta­tions of poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. ‘‘Let’s move to ZITF as dis­tricts to show­case what we have, not just for the al­lowances,” said Zivhu. Zivhu, who is a mem­ber of the Masvingo Prov­ince Zanu-PF ex­ec­u­tive, has been en­gaged in phil­an­thropic work in the last 20 years, sac­ri­fic­ing his salary for the ben­e­fit of his peo­ple. “I like be­ing of ser­vice to the com­mu­nity. It gives me sat­is­fac­tion when I’ve put smiles on peo­ple. ‘‘In my first job in 1995, I only took $20 from my $300 salary and used the rest to buy uni­forms and balls for the Zivhu Tour­na­ment which is still run­ning to this date,” he said. In 1998, Zivhu felt some­thing needed to be done to help Zim­bab­wean cross bor­der women and formed the Zim­babwe Cross Bor­der As­so­ci­a­tion for women who fre­quented South Africa and Botswana to sell their wares. The as­so­ci­a­tion grew to in­clude women trad­ing in a num­ber of coun­tries like China and Mau­ri­tius. But Zivhu still felt he needed to do more for the country’s most vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple. He came up with the Zim­babwe Amal­ga­mated Hous­ing As­so­ci­a­tion. “I in­tend mov­ing to Bu­l­awayo as well as to other ru­ral and ur­ban coun­cils. We’re tar­get­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of our so­ci­ety un­der this pro­gramme. ‘‘ Th­ese are sin­gle moth­ers and wi­d­ows. We want to en­sure they’ve a roof over their heads by pro­vid­ing core houses where they can sim­ply move in. ‘‘Buy­ing and sell­ing stands at times leaves peo­ple very poor as they fail to build houses even over a long pe­riod,” said Zivhu. He called on Zim­bab­weans de­velop a cul­ture of self-re­liance. “No-one can solve our prob­lems ex­cept our­selves, we’ve to be­lieve in who we are and be pa­tri­otic and help de­velop our com­mu­ni­ties and country,” said the busi­ness­man. Zivhu is tipped to win the As­so­ci­a­tion of Ru­ral District Coun­cils of Zim­babwe chair­man­ship in elec­tions to be held to­day. He is up against the in­cum­bent David Guy Mu­tasa of Makoni Ru­ral District Coun­cil. Farai Chaka­tenda of Chegutu Ru­ral District Coun­cil, who has been chair­man of the fi­nance com­mit­tee of the na­tional ru­ral district coun­cils’ body, said it was wrong to live un­der the im­pres­sion that the country’s ma­jor ex­hi­bi­tions were for the big boys. Shep­herd Mud­hara, chair­per­son for the Ton­gog­ara Ru­ral District Coun­cil in Shu­rugwi, said most of the pro­duce and min­er­als were within their ju­ris­dic­tion. “Tak­ing part the two ma­jor ex­hi­bi­tions would see our own farm­ers, min­ers and busi­ness peo­ple mar­ket­ing at an even higher level than the district shows,” said Mud­hara. in to",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180104,Shiri mulls three agric pol­icy ini­tia­tives,"GOV­ERN­MENT is working on three agri­cul­tural pol­icy ini­tia­tives to boost pro­duc­tiv­ity and in­crease the sec­tor’s for­eign cur­rency gen­er­a­tion. This was dis­closed by Lands, Agri­cul­ture and Ru­ral Re­set­tle­ment Min­is­ter Chief Air Mar­shal (Re­tired) Per­rance Shiri, while of­fi­ci­at­ing at a hor­ti­cul­ture stake­hold­ers’ con­fer­ence in Harare yes­ter­day. “You may be aware that my min­istry is al­ready working on an agri­cul­ture mar­ket­ing and trade pol­icy, the hor­ti­cul­ture de­vel­op­ment pol­icy and the mech­a­ni­sa­tion and ir­ri­ga­tion de­vel­op­ment pol­icy and has its foot on the ease of do­ing busi­ness ped­dle,” Chief Air Mar­shal (Rtd) Shiri said. He added that agri­cul­ture was not only nec­es­sary to Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but for eco­nomic growth and for­eign cur­rency gen­er­a­tion. “I share with you the com­mon view that agri­cul­ture is not only nec­es­sary for Zim­babwe’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery, but is suf­fi­cient to con­trib­ute be­tween 16 per­cent to 20 per­cent of the GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) and 40 per­cent of ex­ports while pro­vid­ing a solid source of liveli­hood to about 67 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion,” Chief Air Mar­shal (Rtd) Shiri said. Fail­ure to pen­e­trate for­eign mar­kets, lack of ir­ri­ga­tion and mech­a­ni­sa­tion and a de­cline in the hor­ti­cul­tural sec­tor had af­fected the agri­cul­tural sec­tor’s con­tri­bu­tion to the econ­omy, he said. Min­is­ter Shiri said re­vival of the hor­ti­cul­tural sec­tor as a top for­eign cur­rency earner was a top pri­or­ity for Gov­ern­ment. “To­day we wit­ness to­bacco be­ing the lead­ing con­trib­u­tor to agri­cul­tural growth. I am con­vinced that hor­ti­cul­ture is a sleep­ing gi­ant. It is strate­gic in that it would be a di­rect attack on poverty, hunger and mal­nu­tri­tion in ad­di­tion to gen­er­at­ing for­eign cur­rency and cre­at­ing high em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties down the value chain. “His­tor­i­cally, the hor­ti­cul­ture in­dus­try grew rapidly dur­ing the 80s and 90s. The in­dus­try used to con­trib­ute be­tween 3,5 to 4,5 per­cent to GDP and was sec­ond to to­bacco in for­eign cur­rency earn­ings. “Hor­ti­cul­tural ex­ports grew from $3,5 mil­lion in 1986 to $32 mil­lion in 1991 and reached its peak of $143 mil­lion in 1999,” he said. The ma­jor rea­son for growth then, he said, was bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion through the Hor­ti­cul­ture Pro­mo­tion Coun­cil (HPC), min­i­mum reg­u­la­tion, a mar­ket-driven pro­duc­tion strat­egy, high pro­file im­age on the in­ter­na­tional mar­kets and good in­fra­struc­ture and abun­dant land. “As we gather here to­day, these con­di­tions are no longer pre­vail­ing in the in­dus­try. “The hor­ti­cul­ture sec­tor is now dom­i­nated by small-scale pro­duc­tion out­fits that are dot­ted across the coun­try and are sad­dled with tech­no­log­i­cal and skills chal­lenges, in­ad­e­quate credit lines to fi­nance pro­duc­tion hence from a peak of $143 mil­lion in 1999, hor­ti­cul­ture ex­ports fell to about $72 mil­lion in 2005 and $40 mil­lion in 2009,” Chief Air Mar­shal (Rtd) Shiri said. He added that Gov­ern­ment was will­ing to part­ner the pri­vate sec­tor in re­viv­ing the sec­tor and pro­vide the req­ui­site in­cen­tives for its growth. HPC chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Mr Basilio San­damu said the sec­tor was crit­i­cal in gen­er­at­ing ex­port earn­ings, es­pe­cially if chal­lenges fac­ing new en­trants into the sec­tor were ad­dressed. He said chal­lenges faced by farm­ers in­cluded lack of funds, spe­cialised trans­port and other equip­ment. At its peak, Zim­babwe pro­duced 18 400 tonnes of cut flow­ers, 14 200 tonnes of veg­eta­bles and 45 000 tonnes of fruits. Last year, Germany ex­pressed in­ter­est to im­port 15 hor­ti­cul­tural crops from Zim­babwe, a de­vel­op­ment likely to earn the coun­try mil­lions of dol­lars in for­eign cur­rency, as the de­mand for or­ganic crops and Biotech-free cot­ton in­creases on the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket. Zim­babwe is known for pro­duc­ing un­con­tam­i­nated crops that are in high de­mand on the in­ter­na­tional mar­ket. This is ex­pected to boost Com­mand Ir­ri­ga­tion and in­fras­truc­tural de­vel­op­ment, with farm­ers hav­ing an op­por­tu­nity to be trained in pro­duc­tion and pro­cess­ing of the high-value crops. The crops in­clude high qual­ity okra, peas, beans, cu­cum­bers, chill­ies, cel­ery, broc­coli and let­tuce. China has also ex­pressed in­ter­est to im­port cit­rus from Zim­babwe, and a quar­an­tine del­e­ga­tion was re­cently in the coun­try to inspect cit­rus farms to see if they meet the phy­tosan­i­tary re­quire­ments. Phy­tosan­i­tary re­lates to the health of plants, es­pe­cially with re­spect to the re­quire­ments of in­ter­na­tional trade. The coun­try used to be one of the largest ex­porters of a wide range of hor­ti­cul­tural prod­ucts in Africa, sup­ply­ing mar­kets in Europe and the Mid­dle East. Cit­rus ex­ports peaked in 2001 at 45 000 tonnes, be­ing 60 per­cent of fresh pro­duce. Zim­babwe also be­came a valu­able ex­porter of cut flow­ers, and by 2001, it ranked as the sec­ond largest in Africa be­hind Kenya, sec­ond among African, Caribbean and Pa­cific ex­porters, and was the fifth big­gest ex­porter to the Euro­pean Union.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20181211,Zanu-PF at peace with the world,"THE rul­ing ZANU-PF party en­joys fra­ter­nal re­la­tions with fel­low lib­er­a­tion move­ments in the re­gion and abroad. In the South­ern African re­gion (Sadc) ZANU-PF en­joys good re­la­tions with South Africa’s African Na­tional Congress (ANC), Mozam­bique’s Fre­limo, Namibia’s Swapo and An­gola’s MPLA. ZANU-PF is also friends with Tan­za­nia’s Chama Cha Mapin­duzi, Zam­bia’s Pa­tri­otic Front, Botswana’s Demo­cratic Party, among ma­jor sis­ter organisations on the con­ti­nent. Abroad, ZANU-PF cul­ti­vated re­la­tions with coun­tries in North Africa such as Libya, Al­ge­ria and Egypt while over­seas re­la­tions were made with coun­tries such as China, Rus­sia, Cuba, Ro­ma­nia, Korea and so on. Th­ese re­la­tions, stem­ming largely from the lib­er­a­tion war, be­came the ba­sis for geopo­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic in­ter­ac­tions in the post-In­de­pen­dence era in the repub­lic called Zim­babwe. Zim­babwe is a mem­ber of re­gional and global mul­ti­lat­eral organisations such as Sadc, Comesa, African Union, Non-Aligned Move­ment and the United Na­tions. ZANU-PF has branches or rep­re­sen­ta­tions across the Di­as­pora, mainly in South Africa, Bri­tain and the United States of Amer­ica. Zim­babwe has fallen out with Western coun­tries that have im­posed sanc­tions since 2000, but th­ese strained re­la­tions can be lo­cated in history. The West is the orig­i­na­tor of slav­ery and colo­nial­ism. Zim­babwe and Africa got lib­er­ated from slav­ery and colo­nial­ism by fight­ing Western im­pe­ri­al­ists along­side African and other non-western friendly coun­tries. The lib­er­a­tion history was and re­mains a key tie that binds Zim­babwe and its friends abroad. The re­la­tions have changed a lit­tle, save for evolv­ing with glob­al­i­sa­tion. The rul­ing ZANU-PF’s re­la­tion­ship with the world has shaped its in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions. En­gage, re-en­gage . . . As the 17th Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­fer­ence takes place in Esigo­dini, we are likely to be treated to the sol­i­dar­ity mes­sages from sis­ter organisations from the re­gion and abroad. And, yes, that in­cludes also the Amer­i­can De­cem­ber 12 Move­ment! Un­der its new Pres­i­dent and First Sec­re­tary, Cde Em­mer­son Mnan­gagwa, ZANU-PF has main­tained its re­la­tions with the tra­di­tional friends in the re­gion and be­yond. How­ever, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has sought to broaden the ap­proach by ac­tively seek­ing Zim­babwe’s re-en­gage­ment with the world, which has taken greater mo­men­tum un­der his watch. Zim­babwe (led by ZANU-PF) will no longer be a pariah state. Zim­babwe will seek to mend bro­ken re­la­tions with such coun­tries as Bri­tain and Amer­ica, which pun­ished the party and coun­try, alien­at­ing the cadres and of­fi­cials. The ear­li­est sign has been Zim­babwe’s will­ing­ness to re­join the Com­mon­wealth, an or­gan­i­sa­tion it ditched in 2003 amid geopo­lit­i­cal stress. Now, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is look­ing for­ward to guid­ing the party and Gov­ern­ment out of pariah sta­tus. It is a strat­egy that will be use­ful for Zim­babwe and the rul­ing party. The os­traci­sa­tion of Zim­babwe has been costly and worn out the rul­ing party, while giv­ing it a bad name abroad. That Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa is will­ing to re-en­gage the world, and is ac­tively pur­su­ing the goals rep­re­sents a sig­nif­i­cant shift from yes­ter­year. Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness and di­a­logue When Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa be­came leader last year, his sig­na­ture line in en­gag­ing and re-en­gag­ing the world was that “Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness”. This mantra opened new flanks to the ex­tent that un­der his lead­er­ship, the rul­ing party and Gov­ern­ment were will­ing to trans­act with the world. This, by way of eco­nom­ics, would see the coun­try be­ing open to deals that can ben­e­fit the coun­try after the long night of iso­la­tion. Zim­babwe was also will­ing to com­pro­mise, as in­deed it did by re­view­ing its in­vest­ment laws such as the In­di­geni­sa­tion and Eco­nomic Em­pow­er­ment Act in­cor­po­rat­ing the 51-49 clause that stip­u­lated that for­eign in­vestors needed to cede ma­jor­ity equity to lo­cals. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has been de­scribed as a busi­ness-savvy leader and the “Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness” mantra clearly sold this to the world. Zim­babwe had just en­tered the world of re­alpoli­tik. Re­alpoli­tik is de­fined as a sys­tem of pol­i­tics or prin­ci­ples based on prac­ti­cal rather than moral or ide­o­log­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions. The prac­ti­cal con­sid­er­a­tions that the ZANU-PF of Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa are con­cerned with in­clude lift­ing the coun­try from poverty and iso­la­tion and this has been the cor­ner­stone of his en­gage­ment with the world since he came in. This works along­side the other re­forms that are be­ing in­sti­tuted by the party — or­gan­i­sa­tion­ally and philo­soph­i­cally. In re­cent times, the mantra that “Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness” has been for­ti­fied by the ad­di­tion of di­a­logue. So, it now reads “Zim­babwe is Open for Busi­ness and Di­a­logue”. That is how ZANU-PF is chang­ing to em­brace the world. This con­fer­ence will re­ceive a re­port on this new tra­jec­tory and dis­cuss how the party and Gov­ern­ment ought to re­late to the out­side world in Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s Sec­ond Repub­lic.",津巴布韦
zw,The Sunday Mail (Zimbabwe),20190901,‘We are us­ing our own do­mes­tic re­sources’,"Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s push to open up Zim­babwe for in­vest­ment cap­tured the imag­i­na­tion of po­ten­tial in­vestors at the just-ended Tokyo In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on African De­vel­op­ment ( TICAD) sum­mit. In one of his en­gage­ments in Ja­pan, the Pres­i­dent held an in­ter­view with journalists from Nikkei, which is con­sid­ered one of the largest cir­cu­lat­ing fi­nan­cial news­pa­pers in the world. We re­pro­duce the full in­ter­view below. Question: Zim­babwe is suf­fer­ing from high inflation and hunger, some say half of the pop­u­la­tion is liv­ing in poverty. How are you solv­ing your prob­lems as a coun­try? Answer: We must look at the background of Zim­babwe. Since 20 years ago, we had sanc­tions im­posed on us by the West. As a re­sult of that, our econ­omy col­lapsed, our cur­rency col­lapsed. In 2009, we em­braced a bas­ket of cur­ren­cies that in­cluded the US dol­lar, the euro, pound, the rand, pula and so on. Re­cently, when we had the New Dis­pen­sa­tion, which I lead, we de­cided that de­spite the sanc­tions which the West con­tinue to have on us, in par­tic­u­lar the Amer­i­cans un­der ZDERA, we de­cided to open our econ­omy and lib­er­alise the econ­omy on all fronts. Our econ­omy is ba­si­cally agro-based, min­ing and tourism. Th­ese re­sources are do­mes­tic re­sources that we have in the coun­try. We are, there­fore, fo­cus­ing on developing and mod­ernising our agri­cul­ture to fight the sanc­tions, as well as to grow our econ­omy on this ba­sis. To do that, we had to re­move the Indi­geni­sa­tion Act, which was one of the con­straints in at­tract­ing global cap­i­tal to come into our econ­omy. That, we have now re­moved. Q: When did you re­move it? A: We re­moved it last year in Oc­to­ber. We have also fur­ther lib­er­alised our min­ing laws, with re­spect to di­a­monds and platinum; other min­er­als we lib­er­alised soon af­ter I came into of­fice. We then came up with the en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment pol­icy. En­gage­ment mean­ing, we are will­ing and open to en­gage and work with any mem­ber state of the United Na­tions. Re-en­gage­ment means that we would like to re-en­gage with those coun­tries that had dis­en­gaged with us as a re­sult of sanc­tions. So, we have opened up. We now have a raft of re­forms that are be­ing car­ried out through Par­lia­men­tary sys­tems to do with the ease and cost of do­ing busi­ness, re­lax­ation of var­i­ous con­straints in terms of in­vest­ment, repa­tri­a­tion of prof­its from our coun­try and prop­erty rights. All that has been lib­er­alised on the eco­nomic front. We also have po­lit­i­cal and elec­toral re­forms. For the first time, when we had elec­tions last year, we opened up. In the past, the door was closed. We were quite an iso­lated coun­try, ex­cept that we used to re­late to SADC, which is our re­gional bloc. When we went for elec­tions last year, we opened up and we said we wanted the en­tire global ob­servers to ob­serve us, those who wanted to. We had global ob­servers com­ing to our elec­tions for the first time. We also opened the demo­cratic (space) and for the first time in his­tory, (we had) 55 po­lit­i­cal par­ties con­test­ing in our gen­eral elec­tions. In the past, we had five or six. And of the 55, 23 con­tested for the of­fice of the Pres­i­dent. So with the po­lit­i­cal par­ties, you can see how we have opened up the demo­cratic space in Zim­babwe. We con­tinue to ap­peal to the global com­mu­nity to come to Zim­babwe and see the op­por­tu­ni­ties that we have cre­ated. As a re­sult of the New Dis­pen­sa­tion, the EU has re­laxed some of the mea­sures it put on Zim­babwe. To a great ex­tent, there has been di­a­logue be­tween US and the United King­dom, which was re­spon­si­ble for per­suad­ing the EU to impose sanc­tions on Zim­babwe. We are happy that most of the sanc­tions im­posed by the EU are be­ing re­moved. With Bri­tain, we have now up­graded our en­gage­ments to the level of Min­is­ters. We be­lieve that this pos­i­tive ap­proach and dis­cus­sion will con­tinue. There is a new lead­er­ship un­der Mr Boris John­son and I hope he can con­tinue with the same spirit cre­ated by his pre­de­ces­sor. Q: Sanc­tions were im­posed in 2002 and it feels strange that they are the source of tur­moil because inflation has gone up very rapidly. Do you not think it is the fi­nan­cial pol­icy that you have put? A: We have some aus­ter­ity mea­sures that we have put in or­der to res­ur­rect our col­lapsed econ­omy. We also re­moved the bas­ket of cur­ren­cies; now we have our own. We have also opened the ex­change rate of our cur­rency, it is find­ing its place. It has been sta­ble for the past two months, at 8-10 with the US dol­lar. Unfortunately, we had a se­ri­ous drought, which was wors­ened by the dev­as­tat­ing Cy­clone Idai, caus­ing dam­age to in­fra­struc­ture and crops. So, we were fac­ing drastic dam­age in the coun­try as a re­sult of Cy­clone Idai, which also hit Malawi and Mozam­bique. We are de­ter­mined now to put poli­cies to make sure that whether there is drought or no drought, we have a pro­gramme on ir­ri­ga­tion so that we make sure we have enough crops un­der ir­ri­ga­tion; so that whether there is drought or not, we are able to pro­duce enough grain to feed our pop­u­la­tion. That pro­gramme is on­go­ing. Gov­ern­ment is also sub­si­dis­ing farm­ers in terms of seed, fer­tiliser, chem­i­cals, plough­ing and so on. So we are mak­ing sure that we are putting in place mea­sures to guar­an­tee food sup­ply and food security for our peo­ple Q: Besides po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic re­form, are you seek­ing in­ter­na­tional aid? A: About two weeks, we launched a dis­as­ter ap­peal to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity and we had a re­ally good pos­i­tive re­sponse . . . and we are happy with the re­sponse. We have bridg­ing sup­port from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity up to March and April next year. That is the pe­riod which we think we need sup­port. Q: You mean in terms of food cri­sis, but are you seek­ing help from the in­ter­na­tional mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties? A: ZDERA con­strains us. For the past 20 years we can­not access sup­port from the IMF, World Bank, IFIs (in­ter­na­tional fi­nance in­sti­tu­tions). Those Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions can­not ex­tend any lines of credit to Zim­babwe. So, we are sur­viv­ing through our own do­mes­tic means. We are do­ing our best. We can­not bury our heads in the sand and blame the Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions for not giv­ing us credit. We are do­ing our best and us­ing our do­mes­tic re­sources to grow. How­ever, for us to leapfrog and catch up with the rest of the re­gion, this is why we have opened up, and we are invit­ing global cap­i­tal to come into the coun­try by cre­at­ing an en­vi­ron­ment that is con­ducive to at­tract global cap­i­tal. Q: So what are you seek­ing now? Is it in­ter­na­tional as­sis­tance or just the hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance (food pro­gramme)? A: It is both. There is spe­cific ar­range­ment to deal with the cur­rent dis­as­ter that we are fac­ing, then there is the global ap­proach, where we need in­vest­ment into the coun­try. Q: I be­lieve that the source of fund­ing is re­stricted to China? A: No, it not re­stricted to China. Ja­pan can also come on board. Just be­fore I left for Tokyo, I held a ground-break­ing on a project that is be­ing fi­nanced by Ja­pan. So it is not only China. Ja­pan is par­tic­i­pat­ing, Spain is par­tic­i­pat­ing, India is par­tic­i­pat­ing, Rus­sia, Spain, Brazil are par­tic­i­pat­ing. In fact, when I go back home, I am go­ing to be launch­ing an ir­ri­ga­tion project funded by Ja­pan. Q: Is there a way you can re­ceive sup­port from the IFIs? A: Cur­rently, they are un­able to ex­tend any fi­nan­cial sup­port for us because of ZDERA. Q: What about fund­ing? Are there any dis­cus­sions on loans com­ing from Ja­pan or China or any other coun­try? A: I will be meet­ing the Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter to con­tinue to sup­port us in our en­deav­our to re­vive our econ­omy. With re­gards to China, there is the Fo­cac, where African coun­tries are in­vited to par­tic­i­pate and ap­ply for fund­ing for projects. It is of the same plat­form as TICAD. Q: EU has al­ready lifted sanc­tions, what are your ex­pec­ta­tions? A: Most of the mem­ber states of the EU are now in dis­cus­sions with us. We have dis­cus­sions with France, Ger­man has sent a Min­is­ter to dis­cuss and open old ties that we had. Italy has done the same. Brus­sels has also done the same. With re­gards to the EU, there is a lot of progress . . . But with the US, this is where we have the prob­lem, but we are do­ing ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to ap­peal to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to re­visit the ZDERA sanc­tions. Q: There are a lot of re­ports on the crack­down against the op­po­si­tion and that is why the US may be reluc­tant to review the sanc­tions? A: There has been no in­ci­dent where the rule of law has been breached. Not even one in­ci­dent. We ap­ply the rule of law; those who com­mit crime, the law must ap­ply. You can­not have dou­ble stan­dards where the rule of law (ap­plies); if peo­ple funded by the Amer­i­cans com­mit crimes, we should not touch them? No! Zim­babwe is a uni­tary State and our laws ap­ply to ev­ery ci­ti­zen, whether you are in the op­po­si­tion or you are in Gov­ern­ment or don’t be­long to any po­lit­i­cal party at all. If you com­mit mur­der, you get ar­rested; if you com­mit corruption, you get ar­rested; any vi­o­lent act, you get ar­rested. That is the rule of law which we ob­serve. I would like you to quote an ac­tion where Zim­babwe has acted out­side the rule of law, then I would like to hear that. Q: What are US con­di­tions for lifting of sanc­tions? A: Let me give you the background of the ba­sis of sanc­tions. It was the time when Tony Blair was the Prime Min­is­ter of Bri­tain and Ge­orge Bush (Jnr) was US Pres­i­dent. Bush was in­vad­ing Iraq at the time. In Zim­babwe, we were hav­ing our land re­form pro­gramme, which the Bri­tish did not sup­port. So Ge­orge Bush went to the United Na­tions to seek the in­va­sion of Iraq and did not suc­ceed. So they went ahead with will­ing al­lies. Tony Blair then of­fered to sup­port US on Iraq, and Bush of­fered to Blair on Zim­babwe by im­pos­ing sanc­tions against Zim­babwe. That is the background. Q: What mea­sures are there to sta­bilise the cur­rency, which has lost its value . . .? A: As I said, our cur­rency has sta­bilised in the past two months. When we are in this tran­si­tion to open up, our cur­rency had to find a level to which it sta­bilises. Now it has sta­bilised around be­tween 8 and 10 (to the US) . . . It has been there for a long time now and I think the sta­bil­i­sa­tion has started. Q: How do you eval­u­ate former Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe? He has been called a dic­ta­tor here in Ja­pan. A: Former Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe was our com­man­der-in-chief for over 15 years when we fought the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle against Ian Smith. In 1979, we went to Lan­caster (UK) where we got our po­lit­i­cal in­de­pen­dence. Sec­ondly, former Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe is the found­ing father of our in­de­pen­dent Zim­babwe, and the prin­ci­ple griev­ance that we had dur­ing the lib­er­a­tion strug­gle was for us to get back our land. Our land was owned 70 per­cent by less than 5 000 whites and eight mil­lion blacks owned 30 per­cent of the land. That was our ma­jor griev­ance. We un­der­took to re­gain our land through land re­form. That is now be­yond us. When we be­gan that pro­gramme, the sanc­tions were im­posed on us. But now the land re­form is ir­re­versible and we have the land in the hands of Zim­bab­weans, so we are mov­ing on. Q: You are try­ing to is­sue a new Zim­bab­wean dol­lar, is that true? A: Cur­rently, it is al­ready there . . . we have re­moved the bas­ket of cur­ren­cies. Q: What is the difference be­tween Mu­gabe . . . and yourself? A: He is hu­man, he stepped down in Novem­ber 2017 and I was elected to be Pres­i­dent of my party, which is the ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, so that is how I be­came Pres­i­dent. In July last year, I won the elec­tions with over two-thirds ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment — more than 140 seats against the op­po­si­tion’s 60. I have the ma­jor­ity party in Par­lia­ment. I have now lib­er­alised and opened the space . . . in mod­ern times you must com­pete for global cap­i­tal to come into your coun­try. That is why we are do­ing the lib­er­al­i­sa­tion mea­sures in Par­lia­ment, a raft of eco­nomic mea­sures, po­lit­i­cal and so­cial mea­sures. Q: What do you think of the Asian way of so-called de­vel­op­ment dic­ta­tor­ship — less lib­eral in terms of po­lit­i­cal and strong lead­er­ship to eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment — like Sin­ga­pore? Maybe Mr Kagame of Rwanda is the same way. Do you think this lib­eral democ­racy is rel­e­vant to­day? A: The is­sue for Zim­babwe is not to in­ter­ro­gate the ide­olo­gies of other coun­tries. That is not our busi­ness. Our busi­ness is what is good for Zim­babwe, what is good for our peo­ple and what we should do to have a bet­ter life to grow our econ­omy. To do so, we must mod­ernise. Zim­babwe is an agri­cul­tural econ­omy. We must mod­ernise so that each hectare of land must in­crease in yields. To do so, we must bring in the best practises for agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion. We are en­dowed with vast min­er­als — over 60 — but we do not have cap­i­tal to ex­tract those min­er­als for our peo­ple. So we have to go to coun­tries that have the cap­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy to come and share with us, on a win-win ba­sis. Q: In­clud­ing Ja­pan? A: Yes, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, that is why we are here for the TICAD sum­mit. Q: Sorry to come back on the question of fi­nan­cial loans, with IMF and the World Bank out, what is your plan? Are you go­ing to get a loan from China, Saudi Ara­bia, Ja­pan or any coun­try to tackle the debt question? A: The IFIs are not to­tally out. We are go­ing to make an ap­peal to the Paris Club to deal with the debt so that per­haps we can suc­ceed to have some of it to be per­haps can­celled or resched­uled. But on a bi­lat­eral level, we re­late with many coun­tries: Rus­sia, China, Ja­pan, Brazil, India — many coun­tries — and we dis­cuss bi­lat­eral sup­port. That is how we are ap­proach­ing it. Q: Do you have a tar­get amount of the debt you want can­celled by the West? A: Cur­rently, our ex­ter­nal debt is about US$8 bil­lion. My Fi­nance Min­is­ter (Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube) is dis­cussing with the cred­i­tors, some may wish to can­cel, oth­ers may wish to resched­ule. It’s not us who de­cide. But that should not be the saviour for Zim­babwe. The saviour for Zim­babwe should be us to say what re­sources do we have and how we can use those re­sources to grow our own econ­omy and mod­ernise our own econ­omy. Q: Can you say what is caused by the drought has be­come a hu­man­i­tar­ian cri­sis, with peo­ple strug­gling for food? A: No! We have ca­pac­ity cur­rently. In past seasons, we had a surplus and we kept a strate­gic re­serve to feed our peo­ple. The strate­gic re­serve for feed­ing our peo­ple is still there and we are us­ing it. But (it) can­not bridge us from one sea­son to the other. That is why we are ap­peal­ing for sup­port to bridge the gap from Novem­ber to March next year. We have enough food to feed our peo­ple for the next two to three months, but we are busy look­ing for sup­port to bridge the gap to the next sea­son. Q: If some of the US$8 bil­lion debt you owe is can­celled, is it your plan to have sup­port from IMF and the IFIs? A: I do not think you were lis­ten­ing. The Bret­ton Woods in­sti­tu­tions are con­trolled mainly by Amer­ica and Amer­ica is bound by ZDERA, which for­bids th­ese in­sti­tu­tions to ex­tend lines of credit to Zim­babwe. What is crit­i­cally im­por­tant is re­moval of ZDERA. We are busy dis­cussing with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to re­move ZDERA. Q: I un­der­stand the United States is con­cerned by the is­sue of re­stric­tive laws in Zim­babwe? A: There is Posa and Aippa, which are in the process of be­ing re­pealed. We are not re­peal­ing to please Amer­ica, we are re­peal­ing because it is nec­es­sary for us. It is for Zim­babwe and if it helps the Amer­i­cans, so be it.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20161123,Cor­po­rate cap­ture of African agri­cul­ture,"AS many as 422 African land ac­qui­si­tions con­cluded since 2000, an­other 147 mas­sive land deals adding 13,3 mil­lion ad­di­tional hectares are in the pipe­line, ac­cord­ing to a new re­port by The Land Ma­trix ini­tia­tive. The re­port was jointly pro­duced by the In­ter­na­tional Land Coali­tion (ILC), the Univer­sity of Pre­to­ria, the French NGO, Cen­tre de Coopéra­tion In­ter­na­tionale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développe­ment (CIRAD) and sev­eral other part­ners. Ti­tled “Land Ma­trix An­a­lyt­i­cal Re­port II: In­ter­na­tional Land Deals for Agri­cul­ture”, it says that with 42 per­cent of all global land deals, Africa — which faces wors­en­ing land and water scarcity, threat­en­ing food pro­duc­tion — is the re­gion most tar­geted by for­eign in­vestors. With land be­ing leased to wealthy for­eign in­vestors for up to 99 years at un­just give­away prices — $1 per hectare per year in some of the poor­est coun­tries in the world — cou­pled with weak reg­u­la­tions and al­le­ga­tions of cor­rup­tion, the new, post-colo­nial scram­ble for Africa is a bo­nanza for many. Transna­tional cor­po­ra­tions, pri­vate In­dian com­pa­nies, Arab sheikhs, for­eign gov­ern­ments and City of Lon­don and Wall Street eq­uity funds are among the swathe of for­eign in­vestors that have ac­quired vast tracts of farm­land in Africa. The con­ti­nent is seen as the “last fron­tier”, where for­eign in­vestors can gen­er­ate high re­turns, par­tic­u­larly in en­ergy and food pro­duc­tion, fol­low­ing the 2008 global food cri­sis. The vast ar­eas of land they are ac­quir­ing are largely for bio­fuel and food pro­duc­tion for do­mes­tic and ex­port mar­kets, in­clud­ing to high net food im­porters in­clud­ing China, In­dia and Saudi Ara­bia. An­other African pull is cheap labour and a largely un­tapped con­sumer base. The cor­po­rate cap­ture of African agri­cul­ture is largely be­ing blamed on a new style of rad­i­cal, public-pri­vate part­ner­ships, which G8 coun­tries and their al­lies are bankrolling to stim­u­late a “uniquely African Green Revo­lu­tion” in a ma­jor shift in de­vel­op­ment aid. The trum­peted, multi-bil­lion dol­lar ini­tia­tives in­clude the G8’s New Al­liance for Food Se­cu­rity and Nu­tri­tion in Africa (NAFSA), the Bill and Melinda Gates and Rock­e­feller Foun­da­tion’s Al­liance for a Green Revo­lu­tion in Africa (AGRA) and the US govern­ment’s global hunger and food se­cu­rity pro­gramme, Feed the Fu­ture. They have all hero­ically pledged to tackle poverty, im­prove food se­cu­rity and gen­der in­equal­ity in African agri­cul­ture and bring ben­e­fits to small-scale African food pro­duc­ers. They have also promised to sup­port sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture. They plan to achieve these laud­able goals by cham­pi­oning the pri­vate sec­tor, in­clud­ing biotech giants Mon­santo and Syn­genta, to achieve rapid in­dus­trial agri­cul­tural growth to meet the food needs of Africa’s grow­ing pop­u­la­tion, which is pro­jected to dou­ble to 2,4 bil­lion by 2050. Par­tic­i­pat­ing African coun­tries have com­mit­ted to a pol­icy and leg­is­la­tion over­haul to fa­cil­i­tate in­creased pri­vate-sec­tor in­vest­ment and trade. But in­stead of re­duc­ing hunger and poverty, food cam­paign­ers warn, the ini­tia­tives will push the profit-driven in­ter­ests of multi­na­tion­als. Con­cerns are echoed in sev­eral scathing re­ports on the New Al­liance by Ac­tion­aid and the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment. Su­dan, Ghana, Mozam­bique and Ethiopia are the most tar­geted African coun­tries, with most large scale land ac­qui­si­tions con­cen­trated along ma­jor rivers and in East Africa. Food cam­paign­ers have ac­cused G8 na­tions of reneg­ing on the com­mit­ment they made at their L’Aquila sum­mit in Italy in 2009, where they pledged $20 bil­lion to sup­port “coun- try-owned” strate­gies for food se­cu­rity, nu­tri­tion and sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture, re­in­forc­ing the Com­pre­hen­sive Africa Agri­cul­ture De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme (CAADP). The CAADP was sanc­tioned at the AU Heads of State Sum­mit in Maputo in 2003 as a New Part­ner­ship for Africa’s De­vel­op­ment (NEPAD) pro­gramme. African gov­ern­ments com­mit­ted to in­crease agri­cul­ture pro­duc­tion and pledged at least 10 per­cent of na­tional bud­gets to the sec­tor to boost growth. The New Al­liance is the G8’s main strat­egy for sup­port­ing agri­cul­ture in Africa. It was put to­gether by Pres­i­dent Barack Obama and big agribusi­ness at the G8 sum­mit at Camp David in 2012 and funded by the US, UK, France, Italy, Canada, Ja­pan, Ger­many and Rus­sia, which have com­mit­ted $4,4 bil­lion to 10 coun­tries that have signed up to the ini­tia­tive. The US and EU are its big­gest fun­ders. Burk­ina Faso, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Mozam­bique, Nige­ria, Sene­gal and Tan­za­nia are the 10 African coun­tries that have signed up to the ini­tia­tive. Ac­cord­ing to Ac­tion­aid, a to­tal of 180 transna­tional and African cor­po­ra­tions in­clud­ing Mon­santo, Di­a­geo, SABMiller, Unilever and Syn­genta, are par­tic­i­pat­ing in the New Al­liance, plan­ning to in­vest $8 bil­lion in African agri­cul­ture in the 10 par­tic­i­pat­ing African coun­tries. The $150-bil­lion Al­liance for a Green Revo­lu­tion in Africa (AGRA) was launched in 2006. Its key donor and de­vel­op­ment part­ners in­clude the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion, the Rock­e­feller Foun­da­tion — the two found­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions — the Swedish Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, UK’s DfID, USAid, the In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Re­search Cen­tre and Lux­em­bourg. The World Bank, Nor­we­gian fer­tiliser com­pany, Yara In­ter­na­tional and US food gi­ant, Cargill Inc are also part­ners. Part­ners of Feed the Fu­ture, the US pres­i­den­tial global hunger and food se­cu­rity ini­tia­tive, is also op­er­at­ing in many African coun­tries. This in­cludes Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Tan­za­nia and Zam­bia. Small-scale African food pro­duc­ers, the back­bone of Africa’s tra­di­tional farm­ing sys­tems, are ex­pected to largely ben­e­fit as out­grow­ers. The Grow Africa Part­ner­ship, which was founded by the AU and other part­ners, bro­kers col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween gov­ern­ments and in­ter­na­tional and do­mes­tic agribusi­ness, part­ner­ing through the “green revo­lu­tion” ini­tia­tives. Ac­tion­aid’s 2015 re­port high­lights the pres­sures of large scale for­eign in­vest­ments on farm­land in par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries. The re­port, “New Al­liance, New Risk of Land Grabs: Ev­i­dence from Malawi, Nige­ria, Sene­gal and Tan­za­nia,” says 1,8 mil­lion hectares of land have been leased to for­eign in­ter­ests. Nige­ria, whose New Al­liance part­ner is the UK, is al­lo­cat­ing 350 000 hectares of land to eight com­pa­nies. Three of them, Do­min­ion Farms, PZ Wil­mar and Okomu Oil Palm Plc, are in­volved in land grabs in the coun­try, the re­port al­leges. It says the Nige­rian govern­ment is also pro­mot­ing sta­ple crop pro­cess­ing zones (SCPZs), sup­ported by the UK’s DfID, where in­vestors are “guar­an­teed land ac­qui­si­tion”, ben­e­fit from “low av­er­age wages” and are given tax hol­i­days. Small but densely pop­u­lated Malawi, whose New Al­liance part­ner is the EU, has agreed to re­lease 200 000 hectares for large-scale com­mer­cial agri­cul­ture. But Ac­tion­aid’s re­port says its Na­tional Ex­port Strat­egy, whose rec­om­men­da­tions are in­cor­po­rated into the New Al­liance Co­op­er­a­tion Frame­work, al­lo­cates 1 mil­lion hectares to com­mer­cial farm­ing, or more than a quar­ter of all arable land in the coun­try where ac­cess to land re­mains un­justly un­equal. Amend­ments to Malawi’s Land Bill give full power to min­is­ters and lo­cal govern­ment to grant leases over public land with­out public con­sul­ta­tion and there is no limit on the amount that can be al­lo­cated.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20191206,Chi­nese bus firm agrees to set up plant in Zim,"TRANS­PORT prob­lems fac­ing Zim­babwe’s ru­ral and ur­ban pop­u­la­tions could soon be over, amid in­di­ca­tions that a Chi­nese elec­tric bus man­u­fac­turer in­tends to set up an as­sem­bly plant in Harare. The set­ting up of the plant will be done un­der the com­pany’s drive to spread its wings to Africa and is ex­pected to cre­ate thou­sands of jobs. Win­ner­way Au­to­mo­bile Co Ltd, rep­re­sented by its man­ager Mr Yu Wen Ming, has since do­nated one bus to An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion, which has been in­stru­men­tal in bring­ing a high-pow­ered Zim­bab­wean busi­ness del­e­ga­tion here. First Lady Aux­il­lia Mnan­gagwa, the pa­tron of An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion, has a pas­sion for the de­vel­op­ment of Zim­babwe’s econ­omy. It is this pas­sion that has driven her to take this his­toric trip here, the first by a First Lady of Zim­babwe, to un­lock ben­e­fits for the peo­ple across most sec­tors of the econ­omy. Buses man­u­fac­tured by Win­ner­way Au­to­mo­bile Co Ltd use lithium bat­ter­ies, which when fully charged can go for up to 300 kilo­me­tres. The firm, sit­u­ated in Dong­guan City, man­u­fac­tures 8 000 buses an­nu­ally. Mr Yu’s plans to set up the plant was at the in­vi­ta­tion of Amai Mnan­gagwa. “The pro­posal that has been pre­sented to us by the First Lady for us to set up a plant in Zim­babwe is some­thing that we are go­ing to take se­ri­ously,” he said. “Given that it is a huge in­vest­ment, it re­quires fur­ther en­gage­ments and we will en­gage fur­ther and map the way for­ward.” The pro­posal could not have come at a bet­ter time as Zim­babwe is busy build­ing a mass trans­port sys­tem for ef­fi­ciency and pub­lic safety. At present, the coun­try is im­port­ing buses for Zim­babwe United Pas­sen­ger Com­pany (Zupco) for the con­ve­nience of the ur­ban commuters and long-dis­tance trav­ellers. In an in­ter­view af­ter her meet­ing with the com­pany’s ex­ec­u­tives, the First Lady ex­pressed de­light that her en­gage­ment with Chi­nese com­pa­nies was not limited to part­ner­ship ar­range­ments with An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion, but also touched on crit­i­cal sec­tors of the econ­omy such as trans­port. “From the meet­ing we had, Zim­babwe will ben­e­fit a lot if this com­pany es­tab­lishes a plant in our coun­try,” she said. “I have in­vited them to come over to Zim­babwe in line with our mantra ‘Zim­babwe is open for busi­ness’ and they have agreed to look into it.” The First Lady said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa had been run­ning up and down to var­i­ous coun­tries seek­ing ways to ad­dress trans­port chal­lenges faced by ci­ti­zens. “With­out trans­port, there is no mo­bil­ity, no con­nec­tiv­ity, hence the trans­port sec­tor is crit­i­cal in ev­ery coun­try,” she said. “That is the main rea­son why we have in­vited Win­ner­way to come to Zim­babwe.” The First Lady said Zim­babwe was a cen­tral place in Sadc, hence sur­round­ing coun­tries would now visit Zim­babwe to buy from Win­ner­way. “This means their com­pany will ex­pand and sell its prod­ucts to these coun­tries as well,” she said. “When I came here, I was in­vited as the Pa­tron of An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion as well as the First Lady, but the meet­ings have touched on so many is­sues. “Un­for­tu­nately, amongst the del­e­ga­tion we do not have a rep­re­sen­ta­tive from the Min­istry of Trans­port and In­fras­truc­tural De­vel­op­ment, but we will for­ward all that was ob­tained here to the Pres­i­dent.” The mother of the na­tion was amazed by the de­ci­sion by Win­ner­way to do­nate a bus to An­gel of Hope Foun­da­tion. “I want to thank the com­pany for the kind ges­ture, I am short of words,” she said. “The bus will go a long way in as­sist­ing me in ex­e­cut­ing my phil­an­thropic works. Truly this can only be God. We were not ex­pect­ing this and we are grate­ful. We will put the bus to good use. I am al­ways in the re­mote ar­eas, there­fore, this bus could not have come at any bet­ter time.” Mr Den­ford Mu­tashu, pres­i­dent of the Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe Re­tail­ers, who is part of the First Lady’s del­e­ga­tion rep­re­sent­ing busi­ness and pri­vate sec­tor said; “The in­vi­ta­tion by Her Ex­cel­lency Amai Mnan­gagwa to Win­ner­way Au­to­mo­bile to set up a plant in Zim­babwe is a wel­come de­vel­op­ment to the econ­omy of our coun­try.” Mr Mu­tashu said the de­ci­sion to in­vest in Zim­babwe would save the coun­try for­eign cur­rency by cur­tail­ing im­ports of sec­ond-hand ve­hi­cles and ve­hi­cle spare parts from Ja­pan and other re­gions. He thanked the First Lady for lead­ing the del­e­ga­tion, adding that the firm’s in­ter­ests to set up a plant res­onated with many other Chi­nese in­vestors that were will­ing to es­tab­lish man­u­fac­tur­ing plants in Zim­babwe. The del­e­ga­tion toured Win­ner­way Au­to­mo­bile plant and they had a feel of one of the buses. The First Lady was in­vited to China by Chi­naBrand group of com­pa­nies that is owned by Mrs Ju­liana El­hawary. Mrs El­hawary ap­pre­ci­ates the First Lady’s em­pow­er­ment and de­vel­op­ment work she con­ducts through her foun­da­tion. She has been in­stru­men­tal in mo­bil­is­ing po­ten­tial Chi­nese in­vestors who has so far held sev­eral fruit­ful meet­ings with the Zim­babwe del­e­ga­tion led by the First Lady rep­re­sent­ing her foun­da­tion. PRI­VATE businesses are crit­i­cal in grow­ing Zim­babwe’s econ­omy and should ex­ploit Govern­ment moves to im­prove in­fra­struc­ture and make do­ing busi­ness eas­ier by play­ing their part in the at­tain­ment of an up­per mid­dle in­come sta­tus by 2030, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa has said. Ad­dress­ing the Zim­babwe Na­tional Cham­ber of Com­merce (ZNCC) 2019 busi­ness re­view con­fer­ence in Harare yes­ter­day, Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said that un­der the Sec­ond Re­pub­lic, Govern­ment has made di­a­logue one of the key tenets for suc­cess, adding that the en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment ef­forts cur­rently un­der­way were yield­ing pos­i­tive re­sults that the busi­ness com­mu­nity should ex­ploit. “We must all work hard and com­mit to be­come an up­per mid­dle in­come econ­omy by 2030. Once again, the na­tional agenda re­quires col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­forts from all stake­hold­ers, part­ners and you the busi­ness sec­tor, in par­tic­u­lar,” said the Pres­i­dent. “(The) silo men­tal­ity and su­per­man type of ap­proaches will only slow down our col­lec­tive eco­nomic quest. We are stronger work­ing to­gether. I chal­lenge ZNCC to tap into and lever­age the vast op­por­tu­ni­ties availed by the pol­icy of de­vo­lu­tion which my Govern­ment is vig­or­ously im­ple­ment­ing. The mod­erni­sa­tion of our key en­ablers across the eco­nomic spec­trum are pro­gress­ing well. Road, rail, Zimra ICT ca­pa­bil­i­ties and bor­der posts, among oth­ers, are all be­ing at­tended to with vigour and re­newed sense of ur­gency. Mean­while, the en­gage­ment and re-en­gage­ment pol­icy is gain­ing trac­tion and mo­men­tum. In this re­spect, ZNCC must be ready to com­pe­tently en­gage with its coun­ter­parts from across the world who are ea­ger to in­vest in Zim­babwe.” Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa chal­lenged the busi­ness sec­tor to be ro­bust, vi­brant and re­ju­ve­nate their or­gan­i­sa­tion in line with global best prac­tices and trends, al­ways guided by the na­tional in­ter­est.He said the busi­ness sec­tor should be con­vinced in words and deeds that Zim­babwe was a fer­tile land for in­vest­ment and then get the mo­men­tum to mo­ti­vate in­ter­na­tional in­vestors. “Self-be­lief, con­fi­dence and na­tional pride are in­te­gral to our eco­nomic suc­cess,” the Pres­i­dent said. Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa said Govern­ment was im­ple­ment­ing a raft of mea­sures aimed at en­sur­ing vi­a­bil­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness of the coun­try and its prod­ucts. He said it would be un­for­tu­nate if the ZNCC failed to har­ness the vast in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties that ex­ist in the coun­try. The op­por­tu­ni­ties in­clude power chal­lenges, which could be ex­ploited by shrewd busi­ness­peo­ple to set up big businesses. Said Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa: “It is my hope and trust that as cap­tains of in­dus­try and com­merce you will rise to the oc­ca­sion de­manded by our cur­rent eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment epoch and de­velop a pros­per­ous na­tion. Our fu­ture is in our hands. Let us build a Zim­babwe we want, brick by brick, stone upon stone, un­til Vi­sion 2030 is a re­al­ity. “The in­ter­ac­tions, de­bates and in­for­ma­tion ex­changes that will hap­pen here must con­trib­ute in com­ing up with rec­om­men­da­tions that will con­trib­ute to­wards eco­nomic growth, em­ploy­ment, poverty erad­i­ca­tion and a bet­ter qual­ity life for our peo­ple.” ZNCC pres­i­dent Mr Ta­muka Macheka said the cham­ber com­mended the re­cent jump in the World Bank ease of do­ing busi­ness rank­ings from 155 to 140 as a pos­i­tive step, with the big­ger pic­ture fo­cus­ing on be­ing top 100 by the end of 2020. “To achieve this, we im­plore the Govern­ment to fa­cil­i­tate the pro­mul­ga­tion of the ZIDA (Zim­babwe In­vest­ment and De­vel­op­ment Agency) Bill which will en­able the fi­nal­i­sa­tion of the One-Stop-Shop.” ZIDA will con­sol­i­date the agen­cies set up to pro­mote in­vest­ment into a sin­gle point of con­tact for in­vestors. Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Pro­fes­sor Mthuli Ncube said the ZIDA Bill was fi­nalised on Wed­nes­day evening. He ex­plained that Govern­ment had con­trolled the fis­cal deficit, adding that the pe­riod of aus­ter­ity was over, and fo­cus was now on in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity and em­ploy­ment cre­ation.",津巴布韦

Almost three bil­lion peo­ple use th­ese for cook­ing and heat­ing in­doors, which is so pol­lut­ing that the World Health or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) es­ti­mates they kill one of ev­ery 13 peo­ple that die on the planet. the next step on the lad­der is “tran­si­tion fu­els” such as kerosene, char­coal and liquified pe­tro­leum gas, while the top of the lad­der is elec­tric­ity, which thank­fully makes no pol­lu­tion inside your home. Be­cause elec­tric­ity is of­ten pow­ered by fos­sil fu­els, it does con­trib­ute to the prob­lem of global warm­ing. Hence an al­lur­ing op­tion could be to move to clean en­ergy, like wind, so­lar and hy­dro. some sug­gest that de­vel­op­ing coun­tries should skip the fos­sil step and move right to clean en­ergy. How­ever, rich coun­tries are al­ready find­ing the move away from coal and oil to be dif­fi­cult, and there are no easy an­swers for de­vel­op­ing economies. to­day’s cru­cial ques­tion is: what should the world pri­ori­tise? Fif­teen years ago, the world agreed the Mil­len­nium De­vel­op­ment Goals (MDGS), am­bi­tious tar­gets to tackle poverty, hunger, health and ed­u­ca­tion. th­ese goals have di­rected lots of in­ter­na­tional aid and mostly led to im­prove­ment, although much re­mains to be done. Now, the un is con­sid­er­ing the next set of tar­gets for 2015-2030. some ar­gue that we should con­tinue with the few, sharp tar­gets from the MDGS, since we’re still not done. oth­ers point out that other is­sues, like en­vi­ron­ment and so­cial jus­tice, also need at­ten­tion. My think tank, the Copen­hagen Con­sen­sus, is help­ing to bring bet­ter in­for­ma­tion to this dis­cus­sion. We have asked some of the world’s top econ­o­mists to make analy­ses within all ma­jor chal­lenge ar­eas, es­ti­mat­ing the eco­nomic, so­cial and en­vi­ron­men­tal costs and ben­e­fits of dif­fer­ent tar­gets. so, should the almost-three bil­lion peo­ple cook­ing with toxic open fires take higher pri­or­ity than the broader, long term ob­jec­tive of cut­ting back on fos­sil fuel use? it turns out there are smart ways to help on both ac­counts, say econ­o­mists is­abel Galiana and Amy sopinka. Burn­ing fire­wood and dung on open in­door fires is in­ef­fi­cient and causes hor­ren­dous air pol­lu­tion. More than four mil­lion peo­ple each year die from res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness be­cause of smoke from in­door open fires. in Zim­babwe alone, the WHO es­ti­mates 9 200 peo­ple die each year. Most of th­ese are women and young chil­dren, who are also the ones spend­ing their time fetch­ing fire­wood, of­ten from quite far away. Pro­vid­ing cleaner cook­ing fa­cil­i­ties — ef­fi­cient stoves which run on liq­ue­fied gas — would im­prove health, in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity, al­low women to spend time earn­ing money and chil­dren to go to school. the eco­nomic ben­e­fits of get­ting ev­ery­one off dung and wood are as high as the hu­man wel­fare ones: more than us$500 bil­lion each year. Costs would be much lower, about us$60 bil­lion an­nu­ally, in­clud­ing grants and sub­si­dies to pur­chase stoves. Ev­ery dol­lar spent would buy almost us$9 of ben­e­fits, which is a very good way to help. How­ever, the econ­o­mists also pro­vide a more re­al­is­tic tar­get, which turns out to be even more ef­fi­cient. since it is aw­fully hard to get to 100%, they sug­gest pro­vid­ing mod­ern cook­ing fu­els to 30%. this will still help 780 mil­lion peo­ple, but at the much lower cost of us$11 bil­lion an­nu­ally. For ev­ery dol­lar spent, we would do more than us$14 worth of good. While clean cook­ing is im­por­tant, elec­tric­ity can bring dif­fer­ent ben­e­fits. Light­ing means that stu­dents can study after dark, clin­ics can re­frig­er­ate vac­cines, and wa­ter can be pumped from wells so that women do not have to walk miles to fetch it. Nearly 70% of sub-sa­ha­ran Africa still miss ac­cess to elec­tric­ity, ac­cord­ing to 2011 data by the in­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency. About 58% of Zim­babwe, some 7,3 mil­lion peo­ple, still lack ac­cess to elec­tric­ity. the value of get­ting elec­tric­ity to ev­ery­one is about us$380 bil­lion an­nu­ally. the cost is more dif­fi­cult to work out. to pro­vide elec­tric­ity to ev­ery­one would need the equiv­a­lent of 250 more power sta­tions but many ru­ral ar­eas might best be served by so­lar pan­els and bat­ter­ies. this is not an ideal so­lu­tion but would still be enough to make an enor­mous im­prove­ment to peo­ple’s lives. the over­all cost is prob­a­bly around us$75 bil­lion per year, which still does us$5 of ben­e­fits for each dol­lar spent. if we want to tackle global warm­ing, on the other hand, there are some tar­gets we should be wary of. one prom­i­nent tar­get sug­gests dou­bling the world’s share of re­new­ables, par­tic­u­larly so­lar and wind but this turns out to be a rather in­ef­fec­tive use of re­sources. the ex­tra costs of cop­ing with the in­ter­mit­tent and un­pre­dictable out­put of re­new­ables makes them ex­pen­sive, and the cost likely to be higher than the ben­e­fits. How­ever, the world spends us$544 bil­lion in fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies, almost ex­clu­sively in third world coun­tries. this drains pub­lic bud­gets from be­ing able to pro­vide health and ed­u­ca­tion, while en­cour­ag­ing higher Car­bon-diox­ide emis­sions. More­over, gaso­line sub­si­dies mostly help rich peo­ple, be­cause they are the only ones to af­ford a car. to phase out fos­sil fuel sub­si­dies would be a phe­nom­e­nal tar­get, be­cause it would cut car­bon-diox­ide while sav­ing money for other and bet­ter pub­lic uses. the econ­o­mists es­ti­mate that ev­ery dol­lar in costs would do more than us$15 of cli­mate and pub­lic good. With such high-re­turn tar­gets, the eco­nomic ev­i­dence shows that — if care­fully cho­sen — en­ergy tar­gets should def­i­nitely be part of the prom­ises for the next 15 years.

zw,Sunday News (Zimbabwe),20160124,CRI­SIS OF UBUNTU,"IN THE world of free and happy peo­ple, the power of any idea or phi­los­o­phy should be mea­sured by one stan­dard: What does the idea or phi­los­o­phy con­trib­ute to the life and the hap­pi­ness of the mul­ti­tudes, the peo­ple in their num­bers. How much an idea and a phi­los­o­phy con­trib­utes to greater good should be a mea­sure of its stamina. The South African tran­si­tion from apartheid to democ­racy, a sup­posed mir­a­cle, in­serted into the dic­tio­nary of com­mon sense Ubuntu as a pow­er­ful idea whose time had not only come but also a mon­u­men­tal con­tri­bu­tion of the Bantu to hu­man­ity. The proverb Umuntu ngu­muntu nga­bantu was sud­denly pro­moted from its hum­ble sta­tus as a piece of wisdom to a phi­los­o­phy. That the fin­ished South African mul­ti­tudes who had been pushed to the dirty toi­let of his­tory by years of apartheid could for­give their largely un­re­pen­tant vic­timis­ers was un­think­able. The vic­tims of apartheid emerged with the phi­los­o­phy of Ubuntu to for­give their un­for­giv­able mas­ters who through the mouth of Fred­er­ick de Klerk could in­sist in­spite of the over­whelm­ing ev­i­dence of apartheid atroc­i­ties and the suf­fo­cat­ing so­cial in­equal­i­ties that, “my hands are clean.” It is the ar­gu­ment of the present col­umn that Ubuntu has never been a phi­los­o­phy but a clever proverb among many that un­for­tu­nately be­came us­able by foxy politi­cians in calm­ing the many poor for the ben­e­fit of the few rich and pow­er­ful play­ers in the South African econ­omy and polity. As a piece of wisdom that has been ma­nip­u­lated by politi­cians into a pow­er­ful phi­los­o­phy, stretched be­yond its lim­its, Ubuntu is in cri­sis, it has been emp­tied of its orig­i­nal con­tent and loaded with poi­son that con­tin­ues to con­sume the poor and pe­riph­erised peo­ple of South Africa. The day God came down It was ac­tu­ally Arch­bishop Des­mond Tutu, to­ward the con­clu­sion of the pro­cesses of the Truth and Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion Com­mis­sion (TRC) who re­marked that in South Africa, “we of many lan­guages, of dif­fer­ent cul­tures have be­come one, we are the rain­bow peo­ple of God.” The South African Truth and Rec­on­cil­i­a­tion process and the rec­on­cil­i­a­tion, for­give­ness and heal­ing that it was imag­ined to have brought was cred­ited to God him­self, to Ubuntu and some­thing that was called Madiba Magic, the mes­sianic saint­li­ness of the late Nel­son Man­dela, the ter­ror­ist who be­came a for­giv­ing and leg­endary states­man. The Ubuntu of the African peo­ple brought the love of God down to South Africa and lib­er­ated the op­pressed and their op­pres­sors and by that, South Africa had be­come a beau­ti­ful rain­bow na­tion of God. In ac­tu­al­ity, and sadly, the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of Ubuntu were the un­re­pen­tant white su­prem­a­cists who kept the econ­omy and their so­cial priv­i­lege that were stolen dur­ing the long years of apartheid. The many vic­tims of apartheid gained po­lit­i­cal power, hero­ism and their Ubuntu and noth­ing more. As the cur­rent in­creases among the many poor and pe­riph­erised that Rhodes Must Fall ev­ery­where in South Africa, it is be­com­ing clear that Umuntu ngu­muntu nga­bantu as mar­keted by Des­mond Tutu was ac­tu­ally not the orig­i­nal Bantu wisdom, but it had be­come the Chris­tian doc­trine of turn­ing the other cheek so that the en­emy can strike again, the vic­tims of apartheid were per­suaded to for­give the set­tlers, for­get about the econ­omy and wait for the com­ing king­dom of God. Po­lit­i­cally and re­li­giously Ubuntu was used against the Bantu in South Africa. If ever Ubuntu came close to be­ing a phi­los­o­phy, it be­came a phi­los­o­phy of sur­ren­der, a weapon of the weak and a toxic idea that rec­on­ciled the poor vic­tims of apartheid to their poverty and their loss in the game of life. On the Wisdom of the Bantu In the na­tive in­tel­lec­tu­al­ism of Credo Mutwa, pre­sented in the clas­sic Ind­aba my Chil­dren, the re­li­gion and the be­liefs of the Bantu are dis­cussed with rare rev­e­la­tion. In that au­thor­i­ta­tive ex­po­si­tion, Ubuntu is a mem­ber of an ex­tended fam­ily of ideas and prac­tices that be­long to the ar­chive and men­tal li­brary of the Bantu of Africa. Ubuntu, the qual­i­ties of be­ing hu­man, is not iso­lated to for­giv­ing en­e­mies, turn­ing the other cheek or co-habit­ing with greedy in­vaders and set­tlers. At many lev­els Ubuntu as wisdom and an idea that the Bantu val­orised in­cluded many other forms of jus­tice that in­cluded re­venge, re­sis­tance and war it­self. In the many log­ics of Ubuntu, it is pre­sented as cow­ardice and not Ubuntu for a man to al­low the theft of his land, rape of his mother, sis­ter or wife. It is not Ubuntu to per­mit witch­craft and sor­cery in its many forms in­clud­ing im­pe­ri­al­ism to thrive. The Bantu had a wider def­i­ni­tion of witch­craft than we as­sume to­day, steal­ing, greedy ex­pan­sion­ism, the vi­o­la­tion of na­ture and the en­vi­ron­ment, in a way vam­piric cap­i­tal­ism would fit the def­i­ni­tion of witch­craft and sor­cery. A proper Bantu with Ubuntu would rather die than al­low poverty and mis­ery to de­fine him and his fam­ily. A Bantu mother with Ubuntu would not per­mit the ero­sion of Bantu cul­ture, morals and val­ues in her fam­ily and in larger so­ci­ety. For that rea­son, Ubuntu as mo­bilised in the TRC and fronted by Arch­bishop Des­mond Tutu was a cor­rup­tion and an of­fence against the Bantu as peo­ple, the black mul­ti­tudes of Africa who are the re­cip­i­ents of the dark side of im­pe­ri­al­ism. The Fu­ture of Ubuntu As used in the TRC, Ubuntu be­came the self cru­ci­fix­ion of the Bantu, the turn­ing of the spear to stab its owner. From the per­spec­tive of vic­to­ri­ous white su­prem­a­cists and elite black ben­e­fi­cia­ries of fake rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and imag­i­nary heal­ing a na­tive with Ubuntu is a danc­ing na­tive who is happy in his mis­ery. Nel­son Man­dela has been sain­ti­fied as an ex­em­plary na­tive who turned the other cheek af­ter twenty seven years of in­car­cer­a­tion. The na­tive with Ubuntu is a long suf­fer­ing ob­ject that does not ask ques­tions. Ge­orge Or­well was right that when­ever a new saint is an­nounced free think­ing peo­ple should doubt the saint­li­ness and ques­tion the agenda of the saint mak­ers. The trans­mo­gri­fi­ca­tion of Nel­son Man­dela from a banned ter­ror­ist to a big na­tive with mag­i­cal Ubuntu was a de­lib­er­ate ploy by man­agers of the world or­der to calm the un­happy na­tives of South Africa and Africa at large, while the dream of de­coloni­sa­tion in Africa re­mains a night­mare in progress. Ubuntu must be re­cov­ered from those who have stolen and cor­rupted it, turned it to a weapon against the Bantu. Ubuntu as a wisdom, an or­gan within the body of knowledge of the Bantu should be re­stored to its place as an af­fir­ma­tion of life, a strug­gle for jus­tice and lib­er­a­tion, and op­po­si­tion to war, geno­cide, im­pe­ri­al­ism and sor­cery in its var ious man­i­fes­ta­tions. As I write, the land of the mir­a­cle of Ubuntu, South Africa, is be­ing pun­ished eco­nom­i­cally, the rand is be­ing squeezed and the econ­omy suf­fo­cated for the sin of ever mak­ing dal­liances with China, the en­emy num­ber one of the western world in the new Cold War. The world is in­creas­ingly be­com­ing a dan­ger­ous place for smil­ing and danc­ing na­tives. An­other mir­a­cle that is big­ger than Ubuntu must take place, even if it means that we must give birth to our own an­ces­tors, in or­der for com­plete de­coloni­sa­tion to take place.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200401,Global lock­down tight­ens as Covid-19 death toll mounts,"PARIS — Lock­downs aimed at halt­ing the march of the novel coro­n­avirus (Covid-19) pan­demic have ex­tended world­wide as the US out­break con­tin­ued to ac­cel­er­ate with the death toll there pass­ing 3 000. De­spite sliv­ers of hope in stricken Italy, tough mea­sures that have con­fined two-fifths of the globe’s pop­u­la­tion to their homes are be­ing broad­ened. Moscow and Lagos joined the roll call of cities around the world with empty streets, while Vir­ginia and Mary­land be­came the lat­est US states to an­nounce stay-at-home or­ders, fol­lowed quickly by Washington DC. A US mil­i­tary med­i­cal ship steamed into New York, where it will re­lieve pres­sure on the city’s badly stretched health sys­tem. A field hos­pi­tal set up in Cen­tral Park was due to go on­line later yes­ter­day. The scale and speed of the US pan­demic con­tin­ued to ex­pand, with the death toll top­ping 3 000 out of 163 000 known in­fec­tions — the high­est case count for any sin­gle coun­try. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump sought to re­as­sure Amer­i­cans that au­thor­i­ties were ramp­ing up dis­tri­bu­tion of des­per­ately needed equip­ment like ven­ti­la­tors and per­sonal pro­tec­tive gear. But he also of­fered a stark warn­ing, say­ing “chal­leng­ing times are ahead for the next 30 days” as he ac­knowl­edged a po­ten­tial na­tion­wide stay-at-home or­der. “We’re sort of putting it all on the line,” Trump said, liken­ing the ef­forts against coro­n­avirus to a “war”. The num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases around the world rose above 784 000, with 413 000 of those in Europe, which also has the lion’s share of the deaths, ac­cord­ing to an AFP tally. World lead­ers — sev­eral of whom have been stricken or forced into iso­la­tion — are still grap­pling for ways to deal with a cri­sis that is gen­er­at­ing eco­nomic and so­cial shock­waves un­seen since World War II. Trump and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin dis­cussed “closer co­op­er­a­tion” and ad­dressed plung­ing oil prices in a Mon­day call, the Krem­lin said. Putin’s gov­ern­ment was get­ting to grips with its own out­break, with the Rus­sian strong­man urg­ing res­i­dents of Moscow to re­spect a lock­down that has closed all non-es­sen­tial shops, and left Red Square de­serted. Anna, a 36-year-old web de­signer, said the lock­down would be hard for her and her fiveyear-old daughter. “But I don’t want Arina to get sick,” she told AFP on her way to buy bread. “So of course we will ob­serve the quar­an­tine.” Af­ter weeks of a na­tional lock­down in Italy, signs were emerg­ing that dras­tic ac­tion could be slow­ing the spread of the dis­ease. Even though the coun­try’s death toll grew by 812 in 24 hours to 11 591, the num­ber of in­fec­tions climbed just 4.1 per­cent. “The data are bet­ter but our work con­tin­ues,” said Gi­ulio Gallera, the chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer of Lom­bardy, Italy’s worst-hit re­gion. Spain an­nounced an­other 812 virus deaths in 24 hours, tak­ing it past China, where the dis­ease first emerged in De­cem­ber. Even with the US health sys­tem stretched, Trump said he was or­der­ing some ex­cess med­i­cal equip­ment be sent to Italy, France and Spain. The lock­downs are caus­ing hard­ship across the world, but par­tic­u­larly in im­pov­er­ished cities in Africa and Asia. Africa’s big­gest city, Lagos, joined the global stay-at-home from Mon­day, with Nige­rian Pres­i­dent Muham­madu Buhari or­der­ing a two-week lock­down for its 20 mil­lion peo­ple. The mea­sures also ap­ply to the cap­i­tal Abuja. “Two weeks is too long. I don’t know how we will cope,” said stu­dent Ab­dul Rahim, 25, as he helped his sis­ter sell food from a mar­ket stall. Ex­perts in Ger­many, Europe’s eco­nomic pow­er­house, said the virus would shrink out­put there this year by up to 5.4 per­cent. The World Bank warned the eco­nomic fall­out from the pan­demic could cause Chi­nese growth to shud­der to a halt, and thrust mil­lions of East Asians into poverty. The same holds true for large parts of Africa. In Benin, Pres­i­dent Pa­trice Talon said his coun­try could not en­force pub­lic con­fine­ment be­cause it lacks the “means of rich coun­tries”. Aid groups have warned that the coro­n­avirus toll in the de­vel­oped world could pale com­pared with the dev­as­ta­tion it wreaks on de­fence­less pop­u­la­tions in poor states and war zones such as Syria and Ye­men. Three bil­lion peo­ple around the world lack ac­cess to run­ning wa­ter and soap, the most ba­sic weapons of pro­tec­tion against the virus, ac­cord­ing to UN ex­perts. Botswana Pres­i­dent Mokg­weetsi Ma­sisi has also an­nounced a lock­down be­gin­ning April 2 for 28 days. Ma­sisi said that he wanted lock­down to be more than the 21 days stip­u­lated in the con­sti­tu­tion, there­fore he would call par­lia­ment to de­cide how much longer it would be in force. He has also de­tailed a raft of fi­nan­cial in­ter­ven­tions that in­clude a loan re­pay­ment hol­i­day of be­tween three and six months for home and ve­hi­cle loans. Ma­sisi tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 fol­low­ing a trip to Namibia but af­ter three cases were con­firmed on Mon­day, he has de­clared a lock­down. He said that the 2 bil­lion pula Covid-19 re­lief fund would go to­wards a wage sub­sidy for work­ers, guar­an­tee loans by com­mer­cial banks and to give credit to busi­nesses that can’t get it from banks, as well as tax con­ces­sions. “Banks have agreed to of­fer re­struc­tur­ing of loan fa­cil­i­ties this will owner-oc­cu­pied res­i­den­tial mort­gage prop­er­ties and mo­tor ve­hi­cle loans. “All com­mer­cial banks will of­fer a pay­ment hol­i­day for three months with the op­tion to ex­tend to 6 months.” He said that the coun­try would also build up re­serves in­clud­ing grain, wa­ter, med­i­cal sup­plies and fuel. He said fuel prices would be re­duced as they had dropped glob­ally. — AFP",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20200417,TIMB con­sults ahead of to­bacco sales,"THE To­bacco In­dus­try and Mar­ket­ing Board (TIMB) says con­sul­ta­tions are still on­go­ing to en­sure smooth business when the sell­ing sea­son opens next week amid the global pan­demic of Covid-19. Speak­ing by tele­phone from Harare yes­ter­day, TIMB chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Dr An­drew Mat­i­biri said con­sul­ta­tions on how business would be con­ducted when the sell­ing sea­son opens next Wed­nes­day in light of Covid-19 were still in progress and Gov­ern­ment will soon be is­su­ing a state­ment in that re­gard. “It is true that this year’s to­bacco sell­ing sea­son will be open­ing next week. Stake­hold­ers in the to­bacco sec­tor are still in con­sul­ta­tions as to how business will be con­ducted at the auc­tion floors in light of Covid-19. “How­ever, l am not able to give the de­tails per­tain­ing the con­sul­ta­tions at the moment as dis­cus­sions are still in progress. I think the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties will soon be mak­ing a state­ment once the con­sul­ta­tions are over,” he said. The to­bacco sec­tor plays a crit­i­cal role in sus­tain­ing Zim­babwe’s econ­omy by gen­er­at­ing the much needed for­eign cur­rency. The coun­try ex­ports flue-cured to­bacco to dif­fer­ent parts of the world mainly China, South Africa, United Arab Emi­rates, Bel­gium, and In­done­sia. Since the be­gin­ning of the year, Zim­babwe has so far ex­ported more than US$200 mil­lion worth of the golden leaf across the globe. To­bacco is ex­ported through­out the year al­though the bulk of the crop is bought from farm­ers over a few weeks. Mer­chants then process, grade and store the leaf ex­port­ing ship­ments as or­ders flow in. Mean­while, to­bacco farm­ers have since in­di­cated that they are ready to start de­liv­er­ing the ir­ri­gated crop to the floors and their con­tracted buy­ers floors ahead of the 2020 mar­ket­ing sea­son. TIMB has since an­nounced its com­mit­ment to en­sure farm­ers will this year get 50 per­cent of their in­come in for­eign cur­rency. Last sea­son, TIMB an­nounced a new mar­ket­ing sys­tem just a few days be­fore the floors opened, which saw farm­ers with­hold­ing pro­duce while buy­ers also pushed for a re­view of the new ar­range­ment that would see them get­ting 70 per­cent while Gov­ern­ment re­tained 30 per­cent. This year’s to­bacco out­put is pro­jected to de­cline by 13 per­cent to 225 mil­lion kg from a record high of 259 mil­lion kg in the pre­vi­ous mar­ket­ing sea­son largely due to drought. Zim­babwe gen­er­ates US$1 bil­lion an­nu­ally from to­bacco ex­ports and the sec­tor has in re­cent years been crit­i­cal in sus­tain­ing the econ­omy through im­prov­ing the much-needed for­eign cur­rency re­serves. Con­sid­er­able value is added lo­cally to the crop be­fore ex­port. IN­VESTORS on the Zim­babwe Stock Ex­change (ZSE) lost a cu­mu­la­tive $1 bil­lion in the week to Wed­nes­day as stocks traded mixed amid un­cer­tain­ties brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic. World over, in­vestors have in­curred huge losses fol­low­ing the out­break of the Covid-19 pan­demic which has caused se­vere dis­tur­bances to eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. The World Bank al­ready sees the sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa re­gion’s eco­nomic growth fall sharply from 2,4 per­cent in 2019 to be­tween -2,1 per­cent and -5,1 per­cent in 2020. Agri­cul­ture is also ex­pected to sig­nif­i­cantly con­tract due to dis­tur­bances caused by the pan­demic and driv­ing the re­gion into se­vere hunger and poverty. Agri­cul­ture pro­duc­tion is seen con­tract­ing by be­tween 2,6 per­cent in an op­ti­mistic sce­nario and up to 7 per­cent if there are trade block­ages. Agri­cul­ture is one of the key driv­ers for the re­gion, as well as tourism sec­tor, which has al­ready suf­fered due to travel re­stric­tions, with hos­pi­tal­ity groups in Zim­babwe clos­ing their fa­cil­i­ties. Dur­ing the week un­der re­view, to­tal mar­ket value re­treated 1,47 per­cent to $60 bil­lion com­pared to $61 bil­lion recorded in the pre­vi­ous week dragged by losses in the mar­ket’s big cap coun­ters. The pri­mary in­di­ca­tor, the ZSE All Share In­dex, gained a mar­ginal 1,13 per­cent to close at 468,94 points while the ZSE Top 10 In­dex put on 1,74 per­cent to 390,27 points. At 405,34 points, the ZSE Top 15 In­dex was 1,27 per­cent above prior week while the Small Cap paced the fastest with a 4,39 per­cent in­crease to 1 297 points. The Medium Cap was down 0,24 per­cent to 658,88 points but has recorded the high­est year to date gains of 128 per­cent. Head­lin­ing ris­ers for the week, food pro­ces­sor, Dairi­bord put on 42 per­cent to 86,01 cents fol­lowed by Pow­er­speed that jumped 25 per­cent to 26,5 cents. The duo of Dawn and Edgars rose 20 per­cent each to 7,92 cents and 30 cents re­spec­tively. Art wrapped up the top five ris­ers with a 17 per­cent in­crease to 48,2 cents. Other sig­nif­i­cant gains were recorded in CBZ which jumped 13 per­cent to $1,80 while tele­coms gi­ant, Econet put on 7 per­cent to $3,02. Mash Hold­ings and Old Mu­tual each put on 5 per­cent to 18 cents and $38,64 in that or­der while brick mak­ing firm Will­dale put on 4 per­cent to 4,03 cents. On the down­side, diver­si­fied hos­pi­tal­ity group Meik­les eased 11 per­cent to $7,07 from the pre­vi­ous week’s $8. Re­sources group Bin­dura lost 10 per­cent of value to 30 cents while Medtech was down 8 per­cent to 3,66 cents. Cig­a­rette man­u­fac­turer BAT was 6,98 per­cent be­low prior week to close pegged at $80, re­main­ing the most ex­pen­sive stock on the bourse.

Diver­si­fied in­dus­trial gi­ant Innscor lost a mar­ginal 0,68 per­cent to $7,25 while big­gest com­pany by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion, Delta, eased 0,03 per­cent to $6,12.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170131,AU must put money where the mouth is,"Yes­ter­day, we re­ported that the deputy chair of the African Union Com­mis­sion, Dr Eras­tus Mwen­cha had an­nounced moves to fund the or­gan­i­sa­tion com­pletely from in­ter­nal re­sources, which has been Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s con­stant re­frain. This is an as­pi­ra­tion to wean the con­ti­nent of de­pen­dence that has seen the AU’s op­er­a­tions be­ing 70 per­cent funded by non-African donors. It is an un­ten­able sit­u­a­tion. Much worse, it is a ver­i­ta­ble curse for a whole con­ti­nent of 54 re­source-rich coun­tries which must surely make good use of their en­dow­ments and con­trib­ute to­wards the con­ti­nen­tal body and its pro­grammes. It can­not be gain­said that many African coun­tries are poor and fam­ished. How­ever, it is our view that for all the poverty and re­lated chal­lenges there is still room for states to set aside funds for the con­ti­nen­tal body. It is, but nec­es­sary. All that is needed is com­mit­ment. The AU has just directed all mem­ber states to im­ple­ment a 0,2 per­cent levy on el­i­gi­ble im­ports to fi­nance the body, pro­ject­ing at least $1,5 bil­lion an­nu­ally. The new regime is with im­me­di­ate ef­fect and we are warmed that Kenya, Rwanda, Chad and Ethiopia and the Repub­lic of Congo have al­ready im­ple­mented the levy. All coun­tries must fol­low suit and the African Union should put mech­a­nisms to en­sure that all coun­tries must pay up. African states must treat this is­sue with the ut­most ur­gency and se­ri­ous­ness it de­serves. It will be noted that the new pro­pos­als are not en­tirely new, or the first at­tempts to­wards self-suf­fi­ciency. Last year, at the 27th AU Sum­mit in Ki­gali, Rwanda, AU High Rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the Peace Fund, Don­ald Kaberuka, was the one to first pro­pose the 0,2 per­cent levy on all African el­i­gi­ble im­ports. Ac­cord­ing to the pro­posal mem­ber states’ con­tri­bu­tions were grouped in three tiers which would see 60 per­cent of the bud­get cov­ered equally by coun­tries with shares of Gross Do­mes­tic Prod­uct that is four per­cent above the con­ti­nent’s to­tal, that is, Al­ge­ria, An­gola, Egypt, Libya, Nige­ria and South Africa; 25 per­cent equally cov­ered by coun­tries with shares of GDP be­tween one per­cent and four per­cent (12 coun­tries) and the third tier con­sist­ing of coun­tries with shares lower than one per­cent (36 coun­tries) to equally con­trib­ute to the re­main­ing 15 per­cent of the bud­get. This has not been im­ple­mented. Two years ago, the High-Level Panel on Al­ter­na­tive Sources of Fund­ing the African Union was formed. It is re­ported that the panel sug­gested op­tions in­clud­ing: “a) US$2 hos­pi­tal­ity levy per stay in a ho­tel and b) US$10 levy on flight tick­ets for flights orig­i­nat­ing from Africa or with des­ti­na­tions in Africa”. Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, if re­alised, th­ese two op­tions were ex­pected to gen­er­ate $728 mil­lion for the AU by 2017. Ad­di­tion­ally, the panel pro­posed a US$0,005 per SMS levy, which was to raise $1,6 bil­lion if ap­plied by 2017. In 2013, the AU Assem­bly ap­proved th­ese op­tions. Fur­ther, col­lec­tion of the taxes (levy on air tick­ets and the tourism levy) was to be car­ried out in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with Mem­ber States and it was sug­gested that flight tick­ets levy be en­forced in part­ner­ship with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion and na­tional trans­port agen­cies, while the tourism tax be col­lected in close col­lab­o­ra­tion with the min­istries in charge of Tourism in Mem­ber States. Ac­counts were then to be opened in Mem­ber States’ Cen­tral Banks to re­ceive the re­sources col­lected from the two taxes. It goes with­out say­ing that th­ese as­pi­ra­tional tar­gets did not take root. Hence, the con­ti­nent con­tin­ues to wal­low in this need­less and un­for­tu­nate sit­u­a­tion in which 70 per­cent of the bud­get is spon­sored by the so-called ex­ter­nal part­ners who are in essence Western coun­tries. And rather than get bet­ter the sit­u­a­tion has ac­tu­ally de­te­ri­o­rated. We learn, ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics, that AU’s de­pen­dence on part­ner fi­nanc­ing grad­u­ally in­creased from 45 per­cent of the bud­get in 2010 to over 70 per­cent as at 2016. This has seen the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, for ex­am­ple, in­creas­ing fund­ing from 91 mil­lion in 2010 to 330 mil­lion in 2015, mainly for peace and se­cu­rity pro­grammes. The United States, World Bank, China and Turkey are cited as other ma­jor fun­ders of the AU. The sit­u­a­tion can­not be al­lowed to ob­tain for any longer. It is time that African coun­tries put the money where the mouth is.",津巴布韦
zw,The Manica Post,20170512,Pres­i­dent cor­rect on Zim’s econ­omy,"WHILE naïve op­po­si­tion lead­ers have gone to town and back, bick­er­ing on Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s refu­ta­tion to pro­nounce the coun­try a frag­ile state, terming him delu­sional and out of touch with re­al­ity, on the state of de­vel­op­ment in the coun­try, it is of sig­nif­i­cance to first un­pack what a frag­ile econ­omy is. Lit­er­ally, fragility is some­thing which is weak or un­cer­tain, and un­likely to be able to re­sist strong pres­sure or at­tack. Cer­tainly this doesn’t de­scribe Zim­babwe, an up­com­ing econ­omy in its in­fancy, with sta­ble growth recorded over the past year as IMF even re­vised Zim­babwe’s 2017 eco­nomic growth up­wards from mi­nus 2,5 per­cent to two per­cent, hav­ing seen the pro­gres­sive de­vel­op­ment. Crit­ics and op­po­si­tional pol­i­tics gam­blers await­ing any op­por­tu­nity to poke fin­gers at the Pres­i­dent, grabbed this op­por­tu­nity to dis­credit his sen­ti­ments that Zim­babwe was ac­tu­ally one of the most highly de­vel­oped coun­tries in Africa. Dur­ing the Pres­i­dent’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in a dis­cus­sion at the on­go­ing 27th con­fer­ence of the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum for Africa meet­ing in Dur­ban, South Africa, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe chal­lenged the pan­el­lists, ar­gu­ing that Zim­babwe had the high­est lit­er­acy rate on the con­ti­nent and its eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment may be sec­ond after its neigh­bour South Africa. A proven fact that Zim­babwe’s lit­er­acy rate had al­ways been re­garded in high es­teem, iron­i­cally its lit­er­acy lev­els had to be re-eval­u­ated soon after the land re­dis­tri­bu­tion pro­gramme, only to be placed 11th in Africa. How dra­matic. No won­der in his dis­cus­sion en­ti­tled “Eye on Frag­ile States”, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe ques­tioned the ra­tio­nale used to cat­e­gorise the coun­try as a frag­ile state when the coun­try is ac­tu­ally in an eco­nomic pro­gres­sion pe­riod work­ing on var­i­ous programmes to up­lift the liv­ing stan­dards of peo­ple, for in­stance the Zim-As­set ini­tia­tive. This ini­tia­tive saw the coun­try’s agri­cul­tural sec­tor boom­ing after the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the com­mand agri­cul­ture scheme which saw at least 9 600 farm­ers ben­e­fit­ing. In In­dus­try and Com­merce, the coun­try recorded a 47,4 per­cent ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion from a pre­vi­ous 30 per­cent. Con­fed­er­a­tion of Zim­babwe In­dus­tries (CZI) sta­tis­tics prove that ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion rose to 90 per­cent in the cook­ing oil man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, 85 per­cent in yeast pro­duc­tion (which had al­most closed down), 75 per­cent in bis­cuits man­u­fac­tur­ing, 70 per­cent in fur­ni­ture and 60 per­cent in de­ter­gents. In Oc­to­ber 2016, Zim­babwe paid up debt ar­rears amount­ing to $107,9 mil­lion to the in­ter­na­tional bor­row­ing in­sti­tu­tion, a sit­u­a­tion which high­lights an im­prove­ment in the coun­try’s econ­omy as this couldn’t be achieved in a de­pressed eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment and yet Zim­babwe is still cat­e­gorised as frag­ile. “Zim­babwe is also rich in re­sources and can­not be clas­si­fied as frag­ile. Ev­ery coun­try has some ar­eas of fragility in­clud­ing even the de­vel­oped ones like the US which went down on its knees seek­ing as­sis­tance from China to re­store its in­dus­tries,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. Like­wise this is more or less the sit­u­a­tion the coun­try is bat­tling with. Eco­nomic con­flicts from de­vel­op­ing coun­tries largely em­anate from big­ger economies want­ing to ex­ploit re­sources from de­vel­op­ing coun­tries and poor op­po­si­tional pol­i­tics in­tend­ing to chow a few dol­lars from naïve donors. MDC-T leader, Mr Mor­gan Ts­van­gi­rai, through his spokes- per­son, Mr Luke Tam­borinyoka, was quoted say­ing: “With un­em­ploy­ment of over 90 per­cent, a vir­tu­ally dead in­dus­trial sec­tor, acute cash short­ages, where peo­ple are sleep­ing in bank queues, the fragility of our coun­try is not in doubt. If you add health and ed­u­ca­tion, then you have a fully-fledged cri­sis.” Sadly who then is out of touch with re­al­ity here? Other fa­tigued op­po­si­tion lead­ers such as Mr Tendai Biti, leader of Peo­ple’s Demo­cratic Party seized the op­por­tu­nity to dis­credit the Pres­i­dent in an ef­fort to seek rel­e­vance with Mr Ts­van­gi­rai whom he an­tic­i­pates will lend an open hand into sign­ing a unit pact. Mr Biti also claimed that over 75 per­cent of Zim­bab­weans live in ex­treme poverty and 70 per­cent use the bush as toi­let. Hon­estly how can the use of a bush toi­let be a mea­sure to as­sess the fragility of the na­tion, not to men­tion the fig­ures which Biti came up with out of the blues? It’s about time Zim­bab­weans de­cide for them­selves what’s ra­tio­nal and not, who to be­lieve or not. Fragility or not, no one has the right to de­ter­mine that for us.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170831,"Africa should close pro­tec­tion, sus­tain­abil­ity gap","ACROSS the globe, con­sumers are in­creas­ingly real­is­ing their power. In many coun­tries, this con­sumer con­scious­ness, which mar­ries con­sumer rights to sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues, has been greatly helped by dy­namic con­sumer pro­tec­tion poli­cies. In Africa, the rise of the mid­dle class is fu­elling a con­sumer econ­omy and coun­tries have be­gun to beef up their con­sumer pro­tec­tion poli­cies. But they tend to be dis­con­nected from sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues. South Africa, which leads the con­ti­nent in terms of con­sumer pro­tec­tion reg­u­la­tions, show­cases this lim­i­ta­tion. The coun­try has a good con­sumer pro­tec­tion pol­icy regime, ben­e­fit­ing con­sumers and pro­vid­ing them with rights and re­dress pos­si­bil­i­ties. But it’s not linked to sus­tain­abil­ity con­cerns. The South African sit­u­a­tion is not helped by the lo­ca­tion of con­sumer af­fairs and sus­tain­abil­ity in two sep­a­rate gov­ern­ment de­part­ments. Con­sumer pro­tec­tion pol­icy is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of the Depart­ment of Trade and In­dus­try. For its part, sus­tain­abil­ity is pri­mar­ily lo­cated in the Depart­ment of En­vi­ron­men­tal Af­fairs. As a re­sult, there’s a dis­con­nect be­tween the two. South Africa — and other African coun­tries suf­fer­ing from this dis­con­nec­tion — need to de­velop a new frame­work. Our study iden­ti­fies key areas coun­tries should fo­cus on to get to an in­te­grated ap­proach. In­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence In re­cent years, many coun­tries have amended their con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws to con­nect them more closely with sus­tain­abil­ity con­cerns. We looked at a num­ber of in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ences to iden­tify key as­pects that could make up a com­pre­hen­sive con­sumer pro­tec­tion frame­work. Brazil pro­vided help­ful in­sights. It es­tab­lished the Na­tional Con­sumer Bu­reau in 2012. It was de­signed to plan, pre­pare, co­or­di­nate and im­ple­ment the coun­try’s na­tional pol­icy on con­sumer af­fairs. Brazil’s sys­tem runs on a model that ac­tively pur­sues an in­te­grated ap­proach to con­sumer pro­tec­tion and sus­tain­abil­ity. It con­nects a num­ber of gov­ern­ment de­part­ments to work to­gether. De­part­ments and agen­cies in sec­tors like tourism, health, trans­port, avi­a­tion, mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties. To­gether with busi­ness representatives, they co­op­er­ate to en­sure con­sumers rights. Chile has im­ple­mented a na­tional ini­tia­tive ti­tled ed­u­ca­tion for sus­tain­able con­sump­tion. It was de­signed to pro­vide con­sumers with in­for­ma­tion about the en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial im­pact of their daily choices. The un­der­ly­ing pol­icy premise is en­cour­ag­ing re­spon­si­ble con­sump­tion. In Europe, Germany aligned its con­sumer pro­tec­tion law with Euro­pean Union con­sumer rights di­rec­tive. The em­pha­sis is on giv­ing con­sumers bal­anced and in­de­pen­dent in­for­ma­tion so that they can make com­par­a­tive choices. China un­veiled new con­sumer pro­tec­tion laws in 2014. Crit­i­cal changes in­cluded rais­ing penal­ties for false advertising, in­clud­ing false state­ments about hu­man health or safety. But the law is silent on mea­sures re­tail­ers must take to en­sure the ac­cu­racy of prod­uct in­for­ma­tion. While many coun­tries are in­cor­po­rat­ing some el­e­ments of sus­tain­abil­ity into their con­sumer pro­tec­tion leg­is­la­tion, it isn’t hap­pen­ing fast enough on the African con­ti­nent. Lag­ging be­hind Our study showed that con­sumer pro­tec­tion poli­cies in many African coun­tries tend to be nar­row. This is partly dic­tated by eco­nomic con­di­tions. In poorer coun­tries, the ba­sic needs of con­sumers are given prece­dence over sus­tain­abil­ity con­sid­er­a­tions. In ad­di­tion, poverty lim­its con­sumer choices. Prod­ucts that are pro­duced in a way that doesn’t dam­age the en­vi­ron­ment tend to be more ex­pen­sive. Ide­ally, there should be a mix of pol­icy in­stru­ments to en­able con­sumers to make more sus­tain­able con­sump­tion choices. These must touch on prod­uct safety reg­u­la­tions, prod­uct in­for­ma­tion pro­vi­sion and con­sumer in­for­ma­tion stan­dards. South Africa’s Con­sumer Pro­tec­tion Act has gone some way to clos­ing the gap. The act pro­vides for in­dus­tries to vol­un­tar­ily im­ple­ment min­i­mum sus­tain­abil­ity com­pli­ance re­quire­ments. In ad­di­tion, the gov­ern­ment has pow­ers to pre­scribe min­i­mum in­dus­try sec­tor stan­dards. But lit­tle has been done to put in place mech­a­nisms to en­force these pro­vi­sions. This also lim­its the in­ser­tion of sus­tain­abil­ity goals into con­sumer pro­tec­tion pol­icy. On top of this the act should be amended with a view to: ◆ im­prov­ing the def­i­ni­tion of key con­cepts of sus­tain­abil­ity and sus­tain­able con­sump­tion ◆ mak­ing the link be­tween con­sumer pro­tec­tion and sus­tain­abil­ity ex­plicit ◆ and set­ting down min­i­mum re­quire­ments for self-reg­u­la­tion. Be­cause sus­tain­abil­ity strad­dles mul­ti­ple pol­icy do­mains, there needs to be joined-up im­ple­men­ta­tion across gov­ern­ment. ◆ Read the full ar­ti­cle on www. herald.co.zw",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20190822,CITES tells vote-buy­ing dis­ad­van­taged coun­tries to present ev­i­dence,"IF you thought vote rig­ging was only as­so­ci­ated with African elec­tions where the UN al­ways sends well-funded del­e­gates to in­spect them; think again. Right here in Geneva, Switzer­land at the UN Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Western an­i­mal rights groups and some Western coun­tries are buy­ing votes against ivory trade. Iron­i­cally, this is hap­pen­ing within a UN agency be­long­ing to a fam­ily highly re­garded as the cham­pion of democ­racy, with vote buy­ers and sell­ers go­ing un­pun­ished. In what is a clear case of catch­ing those that steal other CITES mem­ber coun­tries’ votes for ivory and rhino horn etc, af­fected coun­tries have been told to pro­vide ev­i­dence of coun­tries steal­ing their votes. Sadc coun­tries are worst af­fected by vote rig­ging as all Western an­i­mal rights groups and some Western coun­tries con­tinue to block any votes for in­ter­na­tional ivory and rhino horn trade. They do so for emo­tional, not sci­en­tific rea­sons. The is­sue of vote rig­ging is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly top­i­cal as we head to the vote on Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zam­bia and Zim­babwe’s ivory trade pro­posal to­day. At the con­fer­ence in Geneva on Mon­day, CITES Sec­re­tary Gen­eral Ivonne Higuero was asked why the Sec­re­tariat is not in­ves­ti­gat­ing the on­go­ing Western an­i­mal rights groups in­flu­enc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, in or­der to re­store the in­tegrity of the CITES vot­ing process and the im­age of the or­gan­i­sa­tion. This comes at a time when fed-up African coun­tries could pull out of CITES in protest over a tainted vot­ing process that robs them of their sov­er­eign rights to trade in their wildlife prod­ucts such as ivory and rhino horn. “I have no ev­i­dence of vote-buy­ing or any­thing like that hap­pen­ing,” said Ms Higuero. “You (mem­ber coun­tries that are com­plain­ing about vote-buy­ing) have to present this ev­i­dence to the CITES Sec­re­tariat.” She cited Res­o­lu­tion 17.3 (mostly in­ef­fec­tive), that calls for vol­un­tary dis­clo­sure by who­ever comes to at­tend CITES meet­ings and is not funded by his or her own gov­ern­ment. How­ever, even here at CoP18 there is ev­i­dence that del­e­gates from “weak” African gov­ern­ments are be­ing spon­sored in dif­fer­ent ways by Western an­i­mal rights groups but did not de­clare this to the CITES Sec­re­tariat. The CITES Sec­re­tariat is also ob­vi­ously aware and can’t deny that Western an­i­mal rights groups don’t only pay for a trip, food and ac­com­mo­da­tion, in or­der to in­flu­ence a CITES out­come. Other cor­rupt CITES vote-in­flu­enc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties happen well be­fore CITES meet­ings. They in­clude out­right bribery; hon­o­raria pay­ments for lec­tures, Board of Di­rec­tor’s fees, research grants and of­fi­cial vis­its are made to brib­able coun­tries. Ms Higuero was quizzed fur­ther about what CITES is do­ing as a reg­u­la­tory agency to ad­dress the on­go­ing and un­fair shut­ting down of Sadc coun­tries’ ivory, rhino horn and hunt­ing mar­kets world­wide. She was asked how it would be pos­si­ble for the CITES Sec­re­tariat to con­trib­ute to­wards the achieve­ment of sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment goals (SDGs) by 2030 when hunt­ing, ivory and horn trade mar­kets for Africa were be­ing shut­down world­wide. In re­sponse, Ms Higuero did not ex­plain how this was go­ing to in­ter­fere with the at­tain­ment of SDGs. In­stead, she said that shut­ting down do­mes­tic mar­kets was be­ing done by sov­er­eign na­tions and CITES had no con­trol over that. Speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, a Zim­bab­wean state vet­eri­nar­ian of­fered a solution to the ele­phant over­pop­u­la­tion chal­lenge in Sadc coun­tries. “They should stand up to CITES CoP18 and tell the US, Europe and all the Western an­i­mal rights groups to come and air­lift African ele­phants to their own coun­tries or any­where else they please since they [African ele­phants] have been de­val­ued by the ivory trade ban and on­go­ing ivory mar­kets shut­down,” he said. The vet con­tin­ued: “If they [the Western na­tions and their an­i­mal rights groups] don’t re­move 40 000 ex­cess ele­phants from Hwange Na­tional Park, for ex­am­ple, in the next few months, then Zim­babwe or an­other Sadc coun­try will be forced to do the right thing - cull the ex­cess ele­phants so that other species and the re­main­ing ele­phant pop­u­la­tions sur­vive.” The Zim­bab­wean vet said Sadc coun­tries should ad­di­tion­ally sue the Western or­gan­i­sa­tions for the costs of main­tain­ing the ex­ces­sive num­ber of an­i­mals and for the gen­eral loss of lesser flora and fauna species. Even African jour­nal­ists fol­low­ing frus­trat­ing events at CITES CoP18 have ob­jected to the way African coun­tries con­tinue to be de­nied the op­por­tu­nity to trade in their wildlife prod­ucts such as ivory. Al­most all Sadc coun­tries are cur­rently ele­phant over­pop­u­lated. There­fore, there are no valid grounds sci­en­tific or moral that should make any­one stop these sov­er­eign coun­tries from ex­er­cis­ing their rights to trade in their stock­pile ivory. “It ap­pears African gov­ern­ments are blind to take on the fight with the neo-colo­nial in­ter­ests,” said Rwan­dan jour­nal­ist Ger­ald Mbada and author of a book on China-Rwanda eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion. “Sadc coun­tries seem to be or­gan­ised but East, West and Cen­tral Africa still are in the dark.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20151212,‘We’ll not work with cor­rupt com­pa­nies’,"PRES­I­DENT Robert Mu­gabe yes­ter­day cas­ti­gated the gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials as­signed to en­gage for­eign com­pa­nies to un­der­take de­vel­op­men­tal projects in the coun­try for in­flat­ing costs and making tax­pay­ers bear the brunt of their cor­rup­tion. The Pres­i­dent also re­vealed that he in­di­cated to Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping that he would not work with cor­rupt com­pa­nies in projects un­der the $4 bil­lion mega deals signed be­tween the two coun­tries. The Chi­nese Pres­i­dent was in the coun­try on a State visit last week that saw the con­clu­sion of 12 land­mark deals cov­er­ing in­fra­struc­ture, en­ergy de­vel­op­ment, agri­cul­ture and trans­port. The State visit was in re­cip­ro­ca­tion of Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe’s visit to the Asian na­tion in Au­gust last year. Ad­dress­ing party supporters at the of­fi­cial open­ing of the 15th Zanu-PF An­nual Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­fer­ence at the Ele­phant Hills Re­sort grounds, Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the gov­ern­ment would be thor­ough in vet­ting com­pa­nies to work with on the projects. He re­vealed that the coun­try was in­volved in a num­ber of joint de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes with other coun­tries and would be con­duct­ing var­i­ous projects with those coun­tries. “Some chair­per­sons have been given pow­ers and are now say­ing we don’t want th­ese peo­ple. We don’t know where that is com­ing from. It’s a chair­man of a prov­ince who is say­ing they don’t want min­is­ters who were ap­pointed by the Pres­i­dent. Who are you? We’ve two prov­inces like that where it was said let us re­move that per­son.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said there was no need to re­move lead­ers from their po­si­tions when they were per­form­ing sat­is­fac­to­rily. “In our con­duct, the char­ac­ter of a leader must be clean,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. This, he said, would de­ter­mine whether or not lead­ers would be re­tained by the peo­ple. He said the cen­tral com­mit­tee is the body that rep­re­sents congress yet the congress is held to check that the party and gov­ern­ment’s obli­ga­tions to the peo­ple are achieved. The Pres­i­dent left the floor in stitches when he re­fused to say down with the Peo­ple First project re­port­edly Cde Mu­gabe said the re­cent visit by Pres­i­dent Xi re­sulted in a num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies part­ner­ing with the gov­ern­ment. “There are some who want to be paid bribes. They build here, if the project we’re do­ing costs $10 mil­lion, you say $13 mil­lion. We then tell China and say we’re back, that road that we want to build now costs $13 mil­lion, and some­one pock­ets $3 mil­lion. That’s what is hap­pen­ing. “This is the rea­son why, I want to tell you the truth, I re­fused to work with some com­pa­nies and told Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping that I don’t want those that are cor­rupt that want to do un­der­hand deal­ings. You in­flate costs, I can use an­other fig­ure you say you want $22 mil­lion when the project costs $20 mil­lion and the $2 mil­lion you’re given through the back door. We said no, we don’t want com­pa­nies like that,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “It’s a cost that’s to be borne by the peo­ple. If it’s $22 mil­lion yet it was $20 mil­lion, we will then pay back to China $22 mil­lion and the peo­ple will pay more for the project which should have cost them less and you’re do­ing it for your own ben­e­fit. Down with you. We don’t want that. If we catch you, you go to prison.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the con­fer­ence should lay down the prin­ci­ples of con­duct in co-op­er­a­tion with the coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment part­ners. “Pres­i­dent Xi said th­ese projects yes, we will help you, fronted by axed Vice Pres­i­dent Joice Mu­juru, say­ing he would not de­nounce a non-ex­is­tent en­tity. He said this was a time to run the party and re­spond to the peo­ple and check whether the party has car­ried out pro­grammes to the expectations of the masses. “Let’s never dis­tance our­selves from the peo­ple, in their own cir­cum­stances, the peo­ple are able to say th­ese are the ones who take care of us when we are in dif­fi­cul­ties, th­ese are the ones who try to make us a bet­ter peo­ple in life, th­ese are the ones who there­fore are more pro­gres­sive and that’s what the peo­ple look at,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. “They look at us in per­spec­tive, it’s not just what the peo­ple have as chal­lenges to­day, it’s also what they have yes­ter­day as chal­lenges and as we all know, there can never be chal­lenges worse than those we faced dur­ing the strug­gle to try and over­come the enemy who had en­trenched them­selves. Over­come him now in that po­si­tion in which he was us­ing guns to de­fend his po­si­tion that re­quired the sac­ri­fices that we made and that’s why we still re­spect our war veter­ans.” but we can help Zim­babwe with more if you give us projects that you think will as­sist you in in­dus­tri­al­is­ing your coun­try. And we will be given more projects but we want straight peo­ple, peo­ple of good con­duct, we don’t want thieves,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the gov­ern­ment would be thor­ough in se­lect­ing com­pa­nies to work with as they do not want cheats who want to ben­e­fit from the projects through cor­rupt ac­tiv­i­ties. The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment pledged $60 bil­lion in loans and grants to Africa over the next three years at the re­cent Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC). Pres­i­dent Xi also an­nounced that his coun­try would roll out 10 ma­jor pro­grammes to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion with Africa in the com­ing three years in the ar­eas of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, agri­cul­tural mod­erni­sa­tion, in­fra­struc­ture, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, green de­vel­op­ment, trade and in­vest­ment fa­cil­i­ta­tion, poverty re­duc­tion and pub­lic wel­fare, pub­lic health, peo­ple-to-peo­ple ex­changes, and peace and se­cu­rity. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe told the con­fer­ence that African Union mem­bers were now talk­ing about in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion to im­prove their re­spec­tive economies, tak­ing a leaf from the Zim-As­set gov­ern­ment blue print. He paid trib­ute to Zipra and Zanla cadres who braved the rav­ages of the war and re­fused to sur­ren­der un­til the coun­try was res­cued from the shack­les of colo­nial bondage. Cde Mu­gabe said the coun­try was in the hands of sov­er­eign peo­ple and no­tions like trib­al­ism and per­son­al­i­ties can­not be ac­com­mo­dated. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the con­fer­ence was held at a time the coun­try was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing drought with vir­tu­ally all the coun­try’s prov­inces af­fected. He said the coun­try has enough grain for the next 10 months and the gov­ern­ment was making ef­forts to get more to reach 2017 as 2016 and part of 2017 would be af­fected by drought. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the con­fer­ence also comes three years since Zanu-PF re­sound­ingly won in the 2013 har­monised elec­tions. He said the re­sults de­liv­ered a blow to the op­po­si­tion who had thought that they stood a chance at clinch­ing the polls af­ter they were part of the Global Po­lit­i­cal Agree­ment “I plead guilty to killing my mother. I stabbed her while she was sit­ting in the din­ing room af­ter she re­fused to give me money and her car, but I be­lieve I was be­ing used by evil spir­its from one of my un­cles. “I left her body on the floor in the din­ing room and I locked the room be­fore I went to the kitchen to wash her blood off my hands. “I took the knife that I used and threw it in the garage and took my mother’s car be­fore driv­ing off. “I went to Senga to see my friend Hither and we drove back to my mother’s house. “I got into the house and packed my clothes in my room. “I went to Dor­cas Murasi’s house where I col­lected $150 be­long­ing to my mother. “I re­turned home and went into my mother’s bed­room where I took $100 from her hand bag. “We went into town and started drink­ing beer at the Bowl­ing Club. “The next morn­ing I drove to Harare in the com­pany of Hither and an­other friend Ronny Madz­imure. “We left Harare for Gweru on the same day and ar­rived the next morn­ing (Satur­day). “At about 12 noon, I left Gweru for Harare and I was still driv­ing my mother’s car. “I left Harare that evening and gave a lift to some peo­ple at the Show­grounds, who were go­ing to Gweru. “When ap­proach­ing the Nor­ton toll­gate, I ran over a pedes­trian. “I left the car at a dairy farm turn off near the Nor­ton toll­gate. “I de­cided to go back to Harare and I hitch-hiked. “On Sun­day I was spot­ted by my un­cle’s friends while in a kombi. “They knew that I had killed my mother. They or­dered the driver of the kombi to stop and they ap­pre­hended me.” in­fa­mously known as the Gov­ern­ment of Na­tional Unity. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the MDCs thought the elec­tions would be a walkover but it turned out Zanu-PF ac­tu­ally walked over them. He said the peo­ple had seen through the MDCs that they have no real mes­sage to de­liver to the masses. “All they talked about was tak­ing over but tak­ing over on the ba­sis of what pro­gramme? That’s the ques­tion they couldn’t an­swer,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said Zanu-PF was the only peo­ple-ori­ented party that cares about the wel­fare of the peo­ple. The Pres­i­dent paid trib­ute to prov­inces for at­tend­ing the con­fer­ence ex­press­ing hope that the next one will at­tract up to 7,000 del­e­gates. He said the party had done its best in the re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise, call­ing on Harare and Bu­l­awayo prov­inces to unite the peo­ple and send mes­sages on the pro­grammes the party was do­ing so that they build the party. The con­fer­ence is be­ing held un­der the theme: “Con­sol­i­dat­ing Peo­ple’s Power through Zim-As­set.” “The no­tion of ZimAs­set has now pen­e­trated the think­ing of our AU mem­bers, there’s now talk of in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion, we must in­dus­tri­alise, we brought it to them and in­deed it was also the talk when we met in Johannesburg with Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He warned that in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion can­not oc­cur eas­ily with­out pro­duc­tion or in­fra­struc­ture. The Pres­i­dent said he thanked Pres­i­dent Xi as he bade him farewell af­ter the Sum­mit of the Fo­rum on China Africa Co­op­er­a­tion (FOCAC) telling him that the projects he had brought had re­ju­ve­nated and brought new blood to the heart of Africa. “Be­cause with the re­sources that they (China) are de­liv­er­ing and I know they’ll de­liver in fu­ture, if those re­sources are han­dled prop­erly, our coun­tries in Africa will cer­tainly take off, they will trans­form. Some will need a longer time to trans­form than oth­ers but then African re­sources must come to the hands of Africa and this is the prob­lem. Some of the nat­u­ral re­sources, even the oil they are dis­cov­er­ing, is first and fore­most the oil of ei­ther France or Amer­ica,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe. He said the coun­tries were tak­ing ad­van­tage of the poor state of African coun­tries by bring­ing their ma­chin­ery and giv­ing them a pit­tance for their re­sources. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the coun­try was lucky that even af­ter ex­ploita­tion by big min­ing com­pa­nies like An­glo-Amer­ica and Rio Tinto, the na­tion still has good gold de­posits un­like oil which can be quickly de­pleted. “Our broth­ers in Africa have got to fight first and fore­most for the own­er­ship of their nat­u­ral re­sources if the as­sis­tance from China is to work. That’s the foun­da­tion. If the re­sources are not their own, those re­sources will just play to the ad­van­tage of our erst­while mas­ters,” he said. Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe said the coun­try has had suc­cess­ful meet­ings in In­dia, Tur­key and China on part­ner­ships cov­er­ing key sec­tors of the econ­omy. He said the gov­ern­ment wanted to pro­mote in­no­va­tion in science and busi­ness for grad­u­ates from ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions to be able to cre­ate em­ploy­ment. “The uni­ver­si­ties must now re­late their cour­ses to pos­si­ble prac­ti­cal pro­grammes and projects. This is what you must do in or­der for you to start a busi­ness,” said Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20151214,"Cli­mate deal hard to im­ple­ment: Ex­perts
. . . Pope calls for sense of sol­i­dar­ity","LE BOURGET (France). — Af­ter a cham­pagne mo­ment in Paris, where min­is­ters from around the world crafted a pact to fight per­ilous cli­mate change, comes the hard part. Ex­perts are un­der no il­lu­sion that cel­e­bra­tions and high-flown rhetoric are enough when it comes to rolling back green­house-gas emis­sions. If any­thing, they say, the di­vi­sions that be­lea­guered the nearly two-week hag­gle have un­der­scored the po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic ob­sta­cles that now lie ahead. The deal fi­nally struck on Satur­day, a day into ex­tra time, en­shrines the goal to cap global warm­ing at two de­grees Cel­sius (3,6 de­grees Fahren­heit) over pre-in­dus­trial lev­els — and at an even more am­bi­tious 1,5C if pos­si­ble. But the bad news is that hu­man­ity may al­ready have used up al­most 1C of that al­lo­ca­tion, the UN’s World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­ga­ni­za­tion warned last month. And the emis­sions-curb­ing pledges sub­mit­ted by 185 coun­tries to give the agree­ment sub­stance, even if fully hon­oured, set the stage for a 3C warmer world. The only hope lies in hard-fought pro­vi­sions in the pact to en­cour­age na­tions to ramp up their ac­tions over time, and thus keep a 2C goal in fo­cus. “This is the key thing to en­sure that the ac­tions get stronger and stronger so that we get to two de­grees and be­low,” WWF cli­mate ex­pert Tas­neem Es­sop told AFP. 2C is the thresh­old at which politi­cians hope mankind can avoid the worst cli­mate change im­pacts: dan­ger­ous storms, drought, sea-level rise, wa­ter wars, mass mi­gra­tion and the spread of diseases. The agree­ment it­self ad­mits “with con­cern” that cur­rent na­tional plans are not enough. As a re­sult, it has built in a num­ber of checks to try and keep the fast-clos­ing 2C win­dow ajar. Scat­tered over dif­fer­ent sec­tions of the 31-page doc­u­ment, the mea­sures col­lec­tively make up what has be­come known as a “ratch­et­ing up” mech­a­nism. It could play a vi­tal part in a pact where VAT­I­CAN City. — Pope Fran­cis yes­ter­day hailed the UN cli­mate ac­cord reached in Paris, but warned that the key now lay in its im­ple­men­ta­tion, es­pe­cially in help for the poor. “The cli­mate con­fer­ence has just ended in Paris with an agree­ment that many de­scribe as his­toric,” the pon­tiff said at An­gelus prayers in St. Peter’s Square. “Im­ple­ment­ing it will re­quire unan­i­mous com­mit­ment and gen­er­ous in­volve­ment by ev­ery­one,” the stern-look­ing pope said. He pointed in par­tic­u­lar at pro­vi­sions in the agree­ment to help poor coun­tries badly ex­posed to cli­mate change. “I urge the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, in its en­tirety, to care­fully fol­low the road ahead, and with an ever-grow­ing sense of sol­i­dar­ity,” he said. Ap­proved by 195 na­tions af­ter a 13-day ne­go­ti­at­ing marathon, the so-called Paris Agree­ment sets the goal of lim­it­ing global warm­ing to “well be­low” two de­grees Cel­sius (3,6 de­grees Fahren­heit) over pre-in­dus­trial lev­els, with a more am­bi­tious tar­get of 1,5 C if pos­si­ble. Ahead of the Novem­ber 30-De­cem­ber 12 UN con­fer­ence, the Pope emis­sions com­mit­ments are vol­un­tary and there is no sin­gle timetable for achiev­ing car­bon re­duc­tions, which sci­en­tists point to as a gap­ing flaw. Ac­cord­ing to the Cli­mate Ac­tion Tracker (CAT), a tool de­vel­oped by four cli­mate re­search in­sti­tutes, most coun­try pledges are “in­ad­e­quate” and “nearly all” gov­ern­ments need to en­hance their 2025 or 2030 con­tri­bu­tions. The first step will be a stock-tak­ing in 2018, two years be­fore the agree­ment en­ters into force, of the over­all im­pact of coun­tries’ progress in aban­don­ing fos­sil fu­els like oil, coal and gas in favour of re­new­able sources ap­pealed ur­gently for ac­tion, say­ing it was “now or never” for a deal and the sit­u­a­tion was “bor­der­line sui­cide.” Ear­lier this year, he pub­lished a hard-hit­ting the­sis on cli­mate change, en­ti­tled “Laudato S”. It laid the blame for warm­ing squarely on hu­man­ity’s shoul­ders and called for an en­ergy revo­lu­tion that would mainly be paid for by de­vel­oped coun­tries. — AFP. like so­lar and wind. The find­ings must in­form the next round of coun­try pledges to re­place those that will en­ter into force with the agree­ment, in 2020. “This will be a sig­nif­i­cant po­lit­i­cal mo­ment where gov­ern­ments will be urged to ramp up their ef­forts,” said Mo­hamed Adow of Chris­tian Aid, which lob­bies on poverty is­sues. Ob­servers are con­cerned that un­less the 2020 pledges are re­viewed soon, the 3C tra­jec­tory will be locked in for at least 10 years. Some coun­tries had set 10-year tar­gets for 2025, oth­ers 15-year ones un­til 2030. “It just makes it harder and harder to take ac­tions that can in fact bring us down to the lev­els we need to be,” said WWF cli­mate an­a­lyst Tas­neem Es­sop. Once the agree­ment takes ef­fect, the col­lec­tive im­pact of coun­tries’ ef­forts will be re­viewed at five-year in­ter­vals from 2023. The out­come of th­ese re­views will “in­form” coun­tries in “up­dat­ing and en­hanc­ing” their pledges ev­ery five years start­ing in 2025. Many had hoped for more a more oner­ous obli­ga­tion on coun­tries to ramp up tar­gets. But this was al­ways go­ing to be a tall or­der. There were ob­jec­tors among both de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing na­tion groups — al­beit for dif­fer­ent rea­sons. The United States, for ex­am­ple, wants pledges to be purely vol­un­tary to avoid be­ing obliged to take the ac­cord to a hos­tile Congress for rat­i­fi­ca­tion. China, In­dia and other de­vel­op­ing na­tions, in turn, wanted to make their com­mit­ments con­di­tional on as­sur­ances of fi­nance to the tune of bil­lions of dol­lars in the com­ing decades to help them switch from cheap and abun­dant fos­sil fu­els to costly re­new­able sources like so­lar and wind. An­other part of the prob­lem was fear of fail­ure — ne­go­tia­tors were keen to avoid a re­peat of the 2009 UN cli­mate con­fer­ence in Copen­hagen which didn’t even come close to seal­ing a global deal. In­stead of a top-down ap­proach of ap­por­tion­ing emis­sions tar­gets, it opened the way to a bot­tom-up ap­proach: na­tions would set their own emis­sions-cut­ting tar­gets and time­lines. The UN’s cli­mate science panel says green­house-gas emis­sions have to drop 40-70 per­cent be­tween 2010 and 2050, and to zero by 2100. And many hope the bat­tle lines will fade as new low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies are de­vel­oped, costs come down and a hoped-for global price on CO2 — a vi­tal pol­lu­tion-cut­ting in­cen­tive — emerges. In­dian cli­mate ne­go­tia­tor Ajay Mathur told AFP this week that the rel­a­tively higher cost of green en­ergy com­peted with the im­per­a­tive of up­lift­ing mil­lions of peo­ple from poverty in de­vel­op­ing na­tions like his one. “The key chal­lenge, it has to be af­ford­able,” he said. Felipe Calderon, chair­man of the Global Com­mis­sion on the Econ­omy and Cli­mate, a think tank, said the tran­si­tion to a low-car­bon econ­omy was al­ready un­der­way, and would be boosted by the agree­ment’s dic­tate to peak fos­sil fuel emis­sions “as soon as pos­si­ble.” “From now, on, the smart money will no longer go into fos­sil fu­els, but into cleaner en­ergy, smarter cities, and more sus­tain­able land use.” — AFP.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20190703,Why the smear cam­paign?,"ZIM­BABWE has been un­der eco­nomic sanc­tions for nearly two decades. To date, it is still reel­ing un­der the ef­fects of the ru­inous west­ern eco­nomic em­bargo that is es­ti­mated to have cost the coun­try nearly US$50 bil­lion, lead­ing to dein­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and mas­sive so­cio-eco­nomic depre­da­tion. It is the re­silience of the peo­ple of Zim­babwe that is in­spir­ing and that has held the coun­try to­gether amid the rav­ages of the dis­pro­por­tion­ate and il­le­gal ac­tions. The peo­ple of Zim­babwe have en­dured unimag­in­able dis­tress, per­pet­ual poverty and des­ti­tu­tion as a re­sult of the eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed with­out any due care or at­ten­tion to the plight of the or­di­nary peo­ple. Un­der the cir­cum­stances when you look and an­a­lyse how the coun­try has per­formed when com­pared to other African coun­tries in terms of eco­nomic growth, then you be­gin to un­der­stand the res­o­lute spirit of the peo­ple of Zim­babwe. Zim­babwe adopted the multi-cur­rency regime in Fe­bru­ary 2009 and the econ­omy re­cov­ered quite sig­nif­i­cantly since with an­nual growth rates of over 10 per­cent un­til about 2012 and even­tu­ally and grad­u­ally de­clin­ing to growth rates there­after of be­low 5 per­cent. The sig­nif­i­cantly high eco­nomic growth rates when the coun­try started us­ing the multi-cur­rency needs to be clar­i­fied to high­light clearly that the de­cline to the lower rates of present day had noth­ing to do with Govern­ment pol­icy, but rather the econ­omy read­just­ing and re­con­fig­ur­ing it­self from the high in­fla­tion­ary pe­riod of the do­mes­tic cur­rency era to the US dol­lar an­chored pe­riod. That is a fact and what we are wit­ness­ing in the econ­omy is in­deed, real growth. From 2009 to 2012, Zim­babwe had lit­tle man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity to back the over 10,5 per­cent eco­nomic growth rate that was be­ing touted as Tendai Biti’s eco­nomic ge­nius. The growth we cur­rently have in Zim­babwe is real growth from a nor­mal base. There are a num­ber telling key statis­tics about eco­nomic growth in some African coun­tries picked ran­domly and all these coun­tries are not and have not been un­der eco­nomic sanc­tions for the past 13 years. Kenya had a growth rate of 4,7 per­cent in 2017, Le­sotho 3,4 per­cent in 2017, and Namibia 4,3 per­cent in 2017. Zam­bia had a growth rate of 6,5 per­cent in 2017 and An­gola had a growth rate of 5.1 per­cent in 2017. Botswana had a growth rate of 5,4 per­cent in 2017, Uganda 5,2 per­cent in 2017 and Mozam­bique 7 per­cent in 2017. Zim­babwe, un­der the full im­pact of eco­nomic sanc­tions, posted a mod­est growth rate of 4 per­cent in 2017. Food for thought. The con­struc­tion of the Beit­bridge-Harare-Chirundu High­way has al­ready com­menced. Com­ple­tion of this mas­sive in­fras­truc­tural project is go­ing to make Beit­bridge Bor­der Post the busiest bor­der in South­ern Africa and pos­si­bly the con­ti­nent. Zim­babwe has gen­er­ally been the gate­way from south­ern to north Africa be­cause of its strate­gic lo­ca­tion. In ex­cess of 300 000 jobs are go­ing to be cre­ated di­rectly as a re­sult of the project while ad­di­tional em­ploy­ment would come through down­stream in­dus­tries. The Tokwe Mukosi Dam with a height of 89,2 me­tres and stor­age ca­pac­ity of 1,8 bil­lion cu­bic me­tres of wa­ter, is the high­est and the largest in­land wa­ter body in Zim­babwe. The main pur­pose of the dam is for ir­ri­ga­tion and hy­dro-power gen­er­a­tion. Tokwe Mukosi Dam is de­signed as a rock fill dam with an up­stream con­crete face, the first dam of this type in Zim­babwe. The Kariba South Ex­pan­sion Project cur­rently un­der con­struc­tion is now over 85 per­cent com­plete and is to be com­mis­sioned later this year. This is a US$533 mil­lion project cur­rently hap­pen­ing in the coun­try. The Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion Project, at a cost of US$1,5 bil­lion, is also an­other pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment. The power projects will help stim­u­late in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ment. The TelOne Fi­bre Op­tic Broad­band Back­bone Project at a cost of nearly $100 mil­lion is on course and due to be com­pleted soon. The Na­tional Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals Ware­house Project will be launched soon and the project en­tails in­vest­ment of over $50 mil­lion. The new Par­lia­ment Build­ing Project at a cost of $100 mil­lion is com­ing to­gether nicely with de­signs and prepara­tory work at an ad­vanced stage. The Kun­zvi-Musami Harare Wa­ter Project at a cost of $600 mil­lion is also on course with Sino-Hy­dro hav­ing ex­pressed in­ter­est and signed an agree­ment with Harare to carry out the project. Now these are just, but a few of the many de­vel­op­ments tak­ing place in Zim­babwe. The ques­tion to pose now is, why the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the neg­a­tive cam­paign against Zim­babwe at a time when such ma­jor projects are near­ing com­ple­tion? Why now specif­i­cally? Well, the an­swer is very sim­ple; those be­hind the anti-Zim­babwe smear cam­paign do not want to see progress in Zim­babwe un­der Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa’s lead­er­ship. With all those projects that will ben­e­fit Zim­babwe and its cit­i­zenry al­ready un­der­way, com­plete or near­ing com­ple­tion, surely it should be a time for cel­e­bra­tion. Alas, sud­denly the smear cam­paign is in over­drive to over­shadow the great work that is be­ing en­gi­neered by Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa and his team and a lot of mega ini­tia­tives come to mind. These in­clude the US$533 mil­lion Kariba South Ex­pan­sion Project which was com­pleted last year and was com­mis­sioned in March that year. Con­struc­tion of the Hwange Ther­mal Power Sta­tion Project at a cost of US$1,5 bil­lion, was com­mis­sioned ear­lier this year. The power project will help stim­u­late eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in the coun­try. Also, TelOne’s Fi­bre Op­tic Broad­band Back­bone Project at a cost of nearly $100 mil­lion is on course and due to be com­pleted soon. The Na­tional Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals Ware­house Project is set to be launched soon at a cost over $50 mil­lion while new Par­lia­ment Build­ing project poised to start at a cost of $100 mil­lion is com­ing to­gether nicely with de­signs and prepara­tory work at an ad­vanced stage. Govern­ment also has its fo­cus on com­plet­ing the Kun­zvi-Musami Harare Wa­ter Project at a cost of $600 mil­lion with the project right on course af­ter Sino Hy­dro ex­pressed in­ter­est and signed an agree­ment with Harare to carry out the project. The Govern­ment’s Com­mand Agri­cul­ture ini­tia­tive has been a huge suc­cess with pro­jected har­vests of over 2 mil­lion met­ric tonnes of maize and this has been over-sub­scribed with even more farm­ers hav­ing reg­is­tered in­ter­est for next sea­son. The ques­tion is, why the in­ten­si­fi­ca­tion of the neg­a­tive cam­paign against Zim­babwe at a time when these mas­sive and pos­i­tive projects are near­ing com­ple­tion? Why now specif­i­cally? Well, the an­swer is very sim­ple; those be­hind the anti-Zim­babwe smear cam­paign do not want to see progress in Zim­babwe un­der ZANU-PF. With all those projects that will ben­e­fit Zim­babwe un­der­way and many near­ing com­ple­tion, surely it should be a time for cel­e­bra­tion, at least among lo­cals. The smear cam­paign has taken cen­tre stage to over­shadow the great work that is be­ing en­gi­neered by ZANU-PF-led Govern­ment. The chal­leng­ing eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion in Zim­babwe is be­ing used to paint a dis­mal and bleak sce­nario judg­ing through news head­lines and con­trived coun­try eco­nomic re­ports. In as much as the present state of the econ­omy ap­pears gloomy, Zim­babwe is on the doorsteps of a phe­nom­e­nal eco­nomic re­cov­ery. The silently im­pend­ing eco­nomic re­vival is due to the coun­try’s pol­icy in­di­geni­sa­tion, the land re­form and eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment. Zim­babwe has strug­gled eco­nom­i­cally due to sanc­tions. Var­i­ous ma­jor in­vest­ment deals have been signed since pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa took over the reins of lead­er­ship; ev­i­dence of Govern­ment’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to turn­around Zim­babwe’s econ­omy. Since com­ing into of­fice and set­ting in mo­tion re­forms un­der the Sec­ond Repub­lic, the Pres­i­dent has made at­tract­ing for­eign in­vest­ment one of his ral­ly­ing calls in the quest to es­tab­lish a mid­dle-in­come econ­omy by 2030. Af­ter Pres­i­dent Mnan­gagwa vis­ited the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China, Zim­babwe got US$1,3 bil­lion for the Hwange Ther­mal units 7 and 8 ex­pan­sion. So far, nearly US$200 mil­lion has been drawn down. Also funded by China are the Robert Gabriel Mu­gabe and Vic­to­ria Falls in­ter­na­tional air­ports. The projects will cost over US$300 mil­lion. While con­trac­tors are al­ready on site in Harare, Vic­to­ria Falls Air­port was com­pleted last year; and crit­ics choose to ig­nore this for selfish rea­sons. There’s also the US$4,2 bil­lion in­vest­ment by Cypriot firm Karo Re­sources un­der­way some­where near Chegutu; it is in two phases: the first phase is US$2,5 bil­lion and they are al­ready drilling. In a demo­cratic coun­try like Zim­babwe, peo­ple are al­lowed to dream and crit­i­cise, but also abuse the priv­i­lege. But no one should lose sleep be­cause of such neg­a­tiv­ity; be­cause of peo­ple who just crit­i­cise, for the sake of it. But only when you are not do­ing any­thing, will you not be crit­i­cised. If you are do­ing some­thing, then you find peo­ple are crit­i­cis­ing you un­til the re­sults of your sweat prove them wrong. The Ba­toka Gorge scheme has been on for the last six or seven years, just look at what progress has been made now be­tween Zim­babwe and Zam­bia. The Great Dyke In­vest­ments project in Dar­wen­dale is an­other ini­tia­tive giv­ing rea­son for peo­ple to smile and be­lieve brighter days are not far away. The Great Dyke In­vest­ments ini­tia­tive is a huge plat­inum project that will fur­ther el­e­vate the coun­try’s pro­file as a sig­nif­i­cant player in the global plat­inum mar­ket, which must serve as fur­ther tes­ti­mony to bol­ster the re­silience and col­lec­tive strength of the Zim­bab­wean peo­ple. Zim­babwe is mov­ing to­wards an in­evitable eco­nomic re­con­struc­tion which will be strongly backed by a resur­gent agri­cul­tural sec­tor, min­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing, the en­hanced con­tri­bu­tion of the Small and Medium En­ter­prises (SMEs) and the steady rise in for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment. The Chi­nese and Rus­sians have been sup­port­ive to this end, in­clud­ing through their in­vest­ment into the coun­try. The EU and the UK have con­tin­ued with the car­rot and stick ap­proach to in­vest­ment and the re­moval of sanc­tions against Zim­babwe. Govern­ment has also em­barked on a wide range of re­forms un­der the Tran­si­tional Sta­bil­i­sa­tion Pro­gramme (TPS) 2018-2019, which is al­ready bear­ing fruits through bud­get sur­pluses, ease of do­ing busi­ness ini­tia­tives, align­ment of leg­is­la­tion, fight­ing cor­rup­tion and restor­ing Zim­babwe’s po­si­tion among the global fam­ily of na­tions. Zim­babwe is cur­rently fac­ing sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges eco­nom­i­cally and to get out of this mire re­quires the col­lec­tive spirit of the peo­ple of this coun­try. It re­quires a pos­i­tive mind­set, pos­i­tive at­ti­tude and that pa­tri­otic de­sire to free the coun­try from this eco­nomic bur­den we find our­selves in. It is just a mat­ter of time be­fore Zim­babwe re­claims her right­ful place as the con­ti­nent’s eco­nomic hub.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170204,‘Value ad­di­tion an­swer to Africa’s chal­lenges’,"LG: The ACBF works closely with African gov­ern­ments and some de­vel­op­ment part­ners out­side the con­ti­nent, would you say your or­gan­i­sa­tion is best placed to bridge the gap be­tween Africa and the rest of the world in terms of de­vel­op­ment? EN: Yes, I feel that we are in a very good po­si­tion to bridge that gap in so far as the foun­da­tion is help­ing the con­ti­nent to en­hance its ca­pac­ity to en­gage with the rest of the world. One of the prob­lems that African coun­tries are fac­ing, which I con­sider to be very se­ri­ous is the in­abil­ity to ef­fec­tively en­gage with the rest of the world whether it’s in terms of trade, in­ter­na­tional ne­go­ti­a­tions and so on and so forth. It’s clear to ev­ery­body that Africa has a lot of part­ner­ships with var­i­ous coun­tries like China, South Korea and Ja­pan, but we of­ten find out that in these en­gage­ments, the chal­lenge for Africa is mak­ing the most of these part­ner­ships. This is be­cause African coun­tries do not have the ca­pac­ity to ef­fec­tively ne­go­ti­ate in their own best in­ter­est. One thing, we have done as ACBF is to try to en­hance the ca­pac­ity of African coun­tries to max­imise these en­gage­ments. For ex­am­ple, dur­ing the last US-Africa Lead­er­ship Sum­mit, we did a com­pre­hen­sive anal­y­sis of the his­tor­i­cal fash­ion of Africa’s en­gage­ment with the US to see how it has evolved and how it has trans­formed over time. We were able to come up with a com­mon po­si­tion, which the AU cham­pi­oned when they went to Wash­ing­ton DC. We think this is the way Africa should be en­gag­ing be­cause this works very well with the Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals and cli­mate agree­ments. LG: Africa has largely re­mained an ex­porter of cheap pri­mary prod­ucts and an im­porter of ex­pen­sive fin­ished prod­ucts. Why is this so con­sid­er­ing that some of the coun­tries have been in­de­pen­dent for about 50 years? EN: Thank you very much for this im­por­tant ques­tion. If you ask me what has been the most nag­ging chal­lenge of African eco­nomic pol­icy in the past 25 to 30 years, I can tell you it is lack of trans­for­ma­tion, lack of value ad­di­tion, lack of ben­e­fi­ci­a­tion and the lack of mak­ing the most of Africa’s pri­mary com­modi­ties. It’s one thing to iden­tify these prob­lems, but you need to know ex­actly why the sit­u­a­tion has hap­pened. First of all, I think African coun­tries mis­tak­enly be­lieved or took on poli­cies that were de­vel­oped out­side and thrust upon them. The rea­son I say that is be­fore the 1970s, African coun­tries were on their way to in­dus­tri­alise. Many coun­tries had built in­dus­tries, they were start­ing to process and trans­form some of their pri­mary com­modi­ties and sud­denly with the Struc­tural Ad­just­ment Pro­gramme and is­sues re­lat­ing to the Wash­ing­ton Con­sen­sus, the gov­ern­ments were forced not to pro­mote in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion but rather to leave it to the pri­vate sec­tor. There is no coun­try in the world where a gov­ern­ment has not played an ac­tive role in pro­mot­ing in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion whether it is in Bri­tain, in the US or as re­cently as we see in China and South Korea. There­fore, it was a great blun­der for African coun­tries to take hook, line, and sinker the poli­cies that were pro­moted from out­side. That set back Africa’s ini­tial in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion march. Re­cov­ery has be­come extremely dif­fi­cult, es­pe­cially when many coun­tries be­gan to dis­cover oil and other kinds of min­eral com­modi­ties. Of course, the temp­ta­tion is that you make quick rev­enue by just ship­ping it in raw form. And when you start en­gag­ing in that process, think­ing about how to add value to it be­comes more com­pli­cated than dif­fi­cult. But lately, the coun­tries are pay­ing se­ri­ous at­ten­tion to man­u­fac­tur­ing. It’s not all hope­less as we speak now. There are coun­tries where things are hap­pen­ing in a pos­i­tive way be­cause they have re­alised that when you talk about poverty and re­duc­ing mas­sive youth un­em­ploy­ment, there is no way you can deal with those prob­lems with­out in­dus­tri­al­is­ing, with­out adding value to your raw ma­te­ri­als, with­out this mas­sive eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion that has to take place. The dif­fer­ence be­tween coun­tries where it is hap­pen­ing and where it is not hap­pen­ing, is just sim­ply a mat­ter of lead­er­ship be­cause in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion is not only a tech­ni­cal is­sue, it is pri­mar­ily a lead­er­ship is­sue. As a vi­sion­ary leader who says ‘we want to in­dus­tri­alise and we have to put the con­di­tions nec­es­sary for in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion to take place and we have to build ca­pac­ity, the tech­ni­cal skills, in­vest in Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy, En­gi­neer­ing and Math­e­mat­ics (STEM) to pro­duce young people who are go­ing to be the work­force that will make it hap­pen and pro­mot­ing en­trepreneur­ship and cre­ate the kind of busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment that will en­able the pri­vate sec­tor to op­er­ate. LG: But how can African gov­ern­ments in­dus­tri­alise when they have poor in­fra­struc­ture, that is, elec­tric­ity deficit and trans­porta­tion? EN: Pre­cisely, that is why I am say­ing it is a mat­ter of lead­er­ship. When I said con­di­tions, ob­vi­ously that is what I was talk­ing about. It is not only the reg­u­la­tory con­di­tions that will make busi­ness easy to do. There is mas­sive in­vest­ment in hu­man cap­i­tal and in phys­i­cal cap­i­tal, the phys­i­cal cap­i­tal be­ing the in­fra­struc­ture. And in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture, es­pe­cially in en­ergy is crit­i­cal. Un­for­tu­nately, as you rightly ob­served, this has been ne­glected for quite a long time. I think the is­sue now, ev­ery­body knows what to do. It’s no longer the case like in the 1960s and 1970s where people didn’t re­ally know what to do. Now ev­ery­body knows what to do. LG: Talk­ing about en­gage­ment be­tween Africa and the rest of the world, there is a school of thought that be­lieves that for Africa to de­velop, it should dis­en­gage. Your thoughts? EN: This is an absolutely dan­ger­ous idea that should never be ped­dled. It has been done be­fore, if it was suc­cess­ful, it would con­tinue to be done. Now I am ask­ing them what model are they fol­low­ing, which coun­try has dis­en­gaged and suc­ceeded? They just don’t have to come and talk about some things that are ide­o­log­i­cal. De­vel­op­ment is not about ide­ol­ogy nor is it about sen­ti­ments. It is a prac­ti­cal is­sue. You do not ac­ci­den­tally get de­vel­oped and you can­not de­velop by sim­ply be­com­ing an en­closed space and de­cide not to en­gage the rest of the world. Did China de­velop by do­ing that? The an­swer is no! China wel­comed mas­sive in­vest­ments from every­where in the world, Ja­pan did the same and they were able to ac­cess mar­kets every­where in the world. Any­body who says Africa should dis­en­gage is talk­ing non­sense. They need to un­der­stand the his­tory of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment as well as the the­ory of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, what works and what doesn’t work. There is a mis­take we make that if some­thing does not work well for us, the best thing is to throw it away. This is the mis­take Africa made with Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Plan­ning. They were told by the 1970s that ‘you have been plan­ning since in­de­pen­dence, your plans are not work­ing, you should do away with them. There is no need to con­tinue Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Plan­ning’ and they be­lieved that ‘this is a new way of do­ing things, do poverty re­duc­tion strate­gies, do medium-term ex­pen­di­ture frame­works and you will be just fine, the mar­ket will take care of busi­ness.’ Well, China and South Korea didn’t stop plan­ning and look where they are now. African coun­tries stopped plan­ning and see where they are now. So, there are people who will come with an idea that stop en­gag­ing be­cause en­gage­ment is not work­ing for you. When a plan doesn’t work, you don’t stop plan­ning, you find a way how to make it work. For me, this idea of dis­en­gage­ment is re­peat­ing an old ide­ol­ogy that has failed else­where, the Soviet Union tried it, even China tried it, they failed and they had to open up. I think we should be very care­ful about this kind of think­ing. LG: But Africa has been very strong in com­ing up with plans or eco­nomic blue­prints yet very poor in terms of im­ple­ment­ing those plans. Will we be able to im­ple­ment some of these plans such as Agenda 2063? EN: Yes, it is en­tirely pos­si­ble and this is where ACBF comes into the pic­ture be­cause our new strat­egy, the 2017-2021 five-year strat­egy fo­cuses strongly on the is­sue of im­ple­men­ta­tion ca­pac­ity. We re­alised that this is a chal­lenge for the con­ti­nent. Even Agenda 2063 it­self, puts a lot of em­pha­sis on the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the ini­tia­tives rather than sim­ply hav­ing them. If you go coun­try by coun­try, you find that the is­sue is no longer about good strate­gies and plans, as you rightly pointed out, it is ac­tu­ally im­ple­ment­ing them. The is­sue of im­ple­men­ta­tion, we have iden­ti­fied from our foun­da­tion that, it is pri­mar­ily an is­sue of ca­pac­ity al­though some people mis­take and think it’s an is­sue of fund­ing or lack of fund­ing. But our stud­ies have shown that lack of three kinds of ca­pac­ity are at the cen­tre of the im­ple­men­ta­tion gap. First is the hu­man ca­pac­ity, which is just the know-how and the skills and abil­ity that people have to im­ple­ment what has been agreed. Sec­ondly, it is the in­sti­tu­tional ca­pac­ity, which we find have been weak or non-ex­is­tent in many in­stances. The third ca­pac­ity prob­lem is what we call soft ca­pac­i­ties. This is where the is­sue of lead­er­ship comes into the pic­ture, or weak lead­er­ship, non-vis­ual lead­er­ship. It is not just about the Head of State, its lead­er­ship across the board. Mind­set is also an­other is­sue. The is­sue of mind­set is crit­i­cal. We found out that if we don’t work on chang­ing the mind­set of people, first of all for Africans to have self-be­lief to change from think­ing that their own sal­va­tion and de­vel­op­ment will come from out­side. They have to be­lieve that they have the abil­ity to de­velop just like ev­ery­body else. That is not an easy thing be­cause once you are used to think­ing in a cer­tain way, chang­ing that is not easy. You are right, im­ple­men­ta­tion is a chal­lenge. It is the one that we are tack­ling head-on. LG: In 2008, Sadc passed the pro­to­col on Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion to foster in­no­va­tion and pro­mote de­vel­op­ment of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy in the re­gion. Nine years on, the re­gion and Africa at large seems to be still lag­ging be­hind in terms of ICTs, yet in the 21st cen­tury, ICTs are con­sid­ered ma­jor driv­ers of de­vel­op­ment. What are some of the con­straints in that area? EN: If you ask people who are in­volved in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy and in par­tic­u­lar in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy, they will tell you right away that the chal­lenge is lack of aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing on the part of those who are sup­posed to be lead­ing or cre­at­ing the en­vi­ron­ment. You will find that it has taken some coun­tries quite a while to even recog­nise that in­no­va­tion is a crit­i­cal com­po­nent of eco­nomic progress and de­vel­op­ment. It is not re­sis­tant but they do not have this kind of aware­ness and un­der­stand­ing at the level of those who lead and those who make pol­icy. It means there­fore that if you look at in­vest­ment, part of the bud­get that goes to train­ing or fund­ing in­sti­tu­tions and people in these ar­eas is quite poor. If you look at the na­tional poli­cies that are nec­es­sary to pro­mote this kind of thing, they are very weak. But there are no two ways about it, the con­ti­nent has to pay at­ten­tion to in­no­va­tion. It means there­fore there has to be the right poli­cies, the right in­vest­ments and the right part­ner­ships that will re­ally pro­mote the growth in this area. Any coun­try that does not pay at­ten­tion to de­vel­op­ing its ICT, I am afraid it’s go­ing to be left be­hind. I un­der­stand that there is also some down­side to it be­cause of­ten­times there is some sort of political re­sis­tance to that. We have to in­vest mas­sively in Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy, En­gi­neer­ing and Math­e­mat­ics and we have to in­crease the bud­get that we put in sup­port­ing these ar­eas in our uni­ver­si­ties and in our ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions and also en­sure that we set the right tone to say this is some­thing that has to be en­cour­aged. LG: Talk­ing about hu­man cap­i­tal util­i­sa­tion, you are on record say­ing the African youths can play a ma­jor role in Africa’s de­vel­op­ment. But how do you utilise the ca­pac­ity when they are not em­ployed? They are highly ed­u­cated but un­em­ployed. EN: Youth un­em­ploy­ment is in my view, prob­a­bly the most sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge fac­ing all African coun­tries with­out ex­cep­tion. Of course, the de­gree of the chal­lenge dif­fers from coun­try to coun­try and the na­ture of the prob­lem also dif­fers. In North Africa, un­em­ploy­ment af­fects ed­u­cated youth but in some other parts of Africa, it is the op­po­site that is large pro­por­tion of un­e­d­u­cated youths, so the solution is not the same even though the prob­lem is the same. The is­sue there­fore is, why is it we have this mas­sive num­ber of young people un­em­ployed and what can we do about it? The rea­son is the cre­ator of em­ploy­ment, which is the pri­vate sec­tor and non-gov­ern­men­tal sec­tor is not well de­vel­oped in many coun­tries. Gov­ern­ments can never be able to em­ploy ev­ery­body to solve the prob­lem of youth un­em­ploy­ment. This is why in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion and de­vel­op­ment of the pri­vate sec­tor is extremely im­por­tant, that is where jobs will come from. That is one di­men­sion. The sec­ond di­men­sion is, I should have started by say­ing em­ploy­ment is a sup­ply and de­mand is­sue. If you want to solve a prob­lem you can solve it on the sup­ply side or de­mand side or both sides. I have looked at the de­mand side, which is those who de­mand labour, which is the pri­vate sec­tor that you have to boost. On the sup­ply side, you have to ask your­self, even if there are job op­por­tu­ni­ties on the de­mand side, which is the case in some of the coun­tries but at the same time, you have a mas­sive num­ber of ed­u­cated un­em­ployed young people and you go to the busi­nesses and they say we are hav­ing hard time find­ing people to em­ploy. It is be­cause your ed­u­ca­tion has not fo­cused on what is needed in the job mar­ket. LG: Why is that so when we have so many people grad­u­at­ing, is it the cur­ricu­lum that is wrong? EN: You con­tinue to pro­duce grad­u­ates who are nei­ther em­ploy­able nor self-em­ploy­able. The ed­u­ca­tional cur­ricu­lum is not match­ing the job mar­ket. That is one chal­lenge. The sec­ond chal­lenge is if you look at where we are fo­cus­ing our ef­forts, 80-90 per­cent of in­sti­tu­tions of higher learn­ing in Africa fo­cus on hu­man­i­ties, on law, on so­cial sciences and arts. Only 10-15 per­cent will do STEM. Are we pay­ing at­ten­tion for ex­am­ple make it manda­tory that be­fore you grad­u­ate, you must take a course in busi­ness de­vel­op­ment and how to be able to cre­ate your own busi­ness if you want to do that so that if you can­not find a job you can start your own busi­ness. There has to be an im­me­di­ate at­tack on this prob­lem. The long time solution is what I have been dis­cussing so that we do not con­tinue to have this mas­sive prob­lem. So we need to at­tack it by the roots. Many coun­tries and many gov­ern­ments still have this anti-busi­ness pos­ture, which is at the heart of the prob­lem. You can­not con­tinue to do that. I am not say­ing you should al­low busi­ness to do what­ever they want but you should pro­mote busi­ness and in­dus­tri­al­i­sa­tion be­cause that is where the jobs will come. It is time for us to call a spade, a spade and pay at­ten­tion to the needs of our pop­u­la­tion. LG: One can­not talk of de­vel­op­ment with­out look­ing at the gen­der dy­nam­ics. What role do African women have to play in the con­ti­nent’s de­vel­op­ment? EN: An extremely im­por­tant role. I see this gen­der is­sue as a de­vel­op­ment is­sue. Some people think it’s an is­sue about women. But it’s an is­sue about your own sur­vival and de­vel­op­ment. If you are smart and ed­u­cated, you will un­der­stand that ev­ery­body should con­trib­ute pos­i­tively. There­fore ev­ery­body should have the same op­por­tu­ni­ties, so there is no need for you to think you have to sub­ju­gate one group in or­der for you to ad­vance. There is no so­ci­ety that can hope to move for­ward with­out ad­dress­ing the is­sue of em­pow­er­ment of women, mak­ing sure that women have equal ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion, equal ac­cess to eco­nomic op­por­tu­nity, they are equally rep­re­sented as men and they earn ex­actly the same amount for the same amount of work. Women have the unique abil­ity to raise chil­dren and there­fore what hap­pens to women de­ter­mines what hap­pens to chil­dren and ul­ti­mately what hap­pens to the so­ci­ety. So if you want so­ci­ety to move, then you must make sure women are given op­por­tu­ni­ties. LG: Lastly, some people say African pol­i­tics has been a de­ter­rent to the con­ti­nent’s de­vel­op­ment. It has been dirty to the ex­tent of af­fect­ing the econ­omy. What do you think should guide the other be­tween pol­i­tics and the econ­omy? EN: There is a say­ing that ‘good pol­i­tics is good eco­nom­ics’. I don’t think this is a chicken and egg is­sue, which one comes first. Pol­i­tics is es­sen­tial, for the fact that it en­ables so­ci­ety to es­tab­lish sys­tems of gov­ern­ment that will make it pos­si­ble for the econ­omy to func­tion and for people to live peace­fully in their so­ci­eties. So to that ex­tent, pol­i­tics has a ma­jor im­pact on the eco­nomic tra­jec­tory and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment. This is not the ques­tion of the na­ture of the pol­i­tics hav­ing prob­lems, I think this is over­sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of the is­sue. The is­sue in my view is that eco­nomic an­a­lysts and I am one of them, who prob­a­bly have been guilty of this in the past, that we have al­lowed our­selves to see eco­nom­ics as some­thing that has noth­ing to do with pol­i­tics. And there­fore, we take pol­i­tics as given but if pol­i­tics is not right, eco­nom­ics will not be right. Let me give you an ex­am­ple, a coun­try has elec­tions and when they fin­ish, a new political party comes into power, if you go and care­fully look at that political power and ask your­self, these are the people who are go­ing to be mak­ing eco­nomic pol­i­tics for the next four to five years, what is their ca­pac­ity to be able to make poli­cies that will bring about de­vel­op­ment? More of­ten than not, what you find is a weak­ness in that cat­e­gory. The rea­son is be­cause econ­o­mists have not been ask­ing the ques­tion that how come we have all these good strate­gies but they do not lead to good re­sults? This is one par­tic­u­lar ex­am­ple why it doesn’t hap­pen be­cause what is of­ten eco­nom­i­cally de­sir­able is not of­ten po­lit­i­cally fea­si­ble. In other words, you can have the best blue­print on the ground but the political tus­sles and fight­ing will make it im­pos­si­ble for it to hap­pen. African coun­tries, re­mem­ber, his­tor­i­cally were cre­ated ar­ti­fi­cially, with just a few ex­cep­tions and were dom­i­nated for a long pe­riod of time. One of the rea­sons that is there is go­ing to be al­ways mul­ti­far­i­ous in­ter­ests, so some­times bal­anc­ing these in­ter­ests from a political stand point is a very dif­fi­cult thing to do.",津巴布韦
zw,The Zimbabwe Independent,20160826,Govt’s growth tar­gets pie in the sky,"GOVERN­MENT’S eco­nomic pro­jec­tions of an av­er­age of 6,6% GDP growth rate be­tween this year and 2018 buoyed by agri­cul­ture and man­u­fac­tur­ing is noth­ing but pie in the sky as macro-eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals and other in­di­ca­tors show oth­er­wise. Zim­babwe’s econ­omy is re­ced­ing on the back of bear­ish trends on the world commodities mar­ket, a rav­aging El Nino-in­duced drought that has left nearly a fifth of the pop­u­la­tion in need of food aid, de­clin­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor out­put and acute cash short­ages. In­fla­tion re­mains in neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory mainly be­cause of the ap­pre­ci­at­ing United States — the coun­try’s main cur­rency — and lower com­mod­ity prices. Be­sides Zim­babwe is sad­dled by debt and in­ter­na­tional re­serves are low. De­spite show­ing signs of re­cov­ery be­tween 2009 and 2013 af­ter dol­lar­i­sa­tion and po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity an­chored on the for­ma­tion of a coali­tion govern­ment, the econ­omy has been in the dol­drums af­ter shrink­ing by 50% be­tween 1998 and 2008 when govern­ment em­barked on the chaotic land re­form ex­er­cise. The chaotic land re­form is blamed for the mas­sive de­cline in agri­cul­tural out­put and re­sul­tant food in­se­cu­rity and star­va­tion. In spite of this, govern­ment has now come up with am­bi­tious growth tar­gets which an­a­lysts and so­cial com­men­ta­tors have dis­cred­ited. The eco­nomic growth tar­gets are con­tained in the fi­nal draft of the in­terim poverty re­duc­tion strat­egy pa­per for the pe­riod 2016-2018. The pol­icy thrust was crafted by the Min­istry of Fi­nance and Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment with in­put from stake­hold­ers. The agri­cul­tural sec­tor, which forms the back­bone of the coun­try’s econ­omy, is badly in need of fund­ing. The sec­tor has strong ver­ti­cal and hor­i­zon­tal in­te­gra­tions with other key eco­nomic sec­tors. Tasked with breath­ing life into the sec­tor, indige­nous farm­ers are strug­gling with strin­gent re­quire­ments to ac­cess farm­ing loans amid se­ri­ous con­cerns of se­cu­rity of ten­ure raised by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions over the un­bank­able 99-year leases. To re­vive the once vi­brant agri­cul­tural sec­tor, govern­ment is banking on funds amount­ing to US$5 bil­lion it is seek­ing from China. How­ever, it is not a clear-cut so­lu­tion yet given un­cer­tainty on whether the trou­bled South­ern African na­tion will get the money in the face of ev­i­dence and his­tory show­ing the coun­try has been fail­ing to re­pay its ar­rears and debts. The coun­try hopes that China will pro­vide funds for con­tract farm­ers to grow tobacco, flow­ers, cot­ton, soya beans and pro­duce beef, among other prod­ucts. A loom­ing drought means govern­ment has to im­port more than 700 000 tonnes of maize, hence wors­en­ing its bur­geon­ing im­port bill. Fi­nance min­is­ter Pa­trick Chi­na­masa had ini­tially fore­cast the econ­omy to ex­pand by 2,7% this year, but re­vised the growth tar­get to 1,4% on ac­count of fall­ing com­mod­ity prices in the global mar­kets and the neg­a­tive im­pact of the drought. The re­vi­sion shows that govern­ment is also aware that achiev­ing eco­nomic growth is a Her­culean task when most sec­tors are not per­form­ing. “The strat­egy tar­gets an av­er­age an­nual growth rate of 6,6% dur­ing the pe­riod 2016-2018, with 2017 and 2018 pro­jected to grow by 9,5% and 8,9%, re­spec­tively,” reads the in­terim re­port of Au­gust 1. The man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which re­cov­ered in 2010, has been record­ing low out­put due to lim­ited con­ces­sion­ary fund­ing to re­tool at a time com­pe­ti­tion from cheap im­ports has been in­ten­si­fy­ing. Lim­ited in­vest­ment in key eco­nomic sec­tors has been at­trib­uted to the coun­try’s poor in­vest­ment laws with crit­ics cit­ing the in­di­geni­sa­tion and em­pow­er­ment laws com­pelling for­eign in­vestors to sell con­trol­ling eq­uity 51% stakes to lo­cals as the ele­phant in the liv­ing room. The man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, which govern­ment has placed its hopes on, has since col­lapsed and will cost an arm and a leg to re­vive it. The sec­tor is grap­pling with ob- so­lete equip­ment, in­ces­sant power cuts, com­pany clo­sures and mas­sive job losses. Fur­ther­more, the con­tin­ued de­cline of in­dus­try’s ca­pac­ity util­i­sa­tion from 57,2% in 2011 to the cur­rent 34,3% epit­o­mises the se­ri­ous chal­lenges faced by a sec­tor. The coun­try’s for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment (FDI) in­flows tum­bled from US$545 mil­lion in 2014 to US$421 mil­lion last year, which rep­re­sents a 23% drop. High lev­els of cor­rup­tion as shown in the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s re­ports, among other bot­tle necks, have dis­cour­aged in­vest­ment in the coun­try. More­over, fail­ure by govern­ment to pri­va­tise paras­tatals, cur­rently bleed­ing the fis­cus, is proof that the pro­jected eco­nomic growth within the next two years is just a fan­tasy. The broke govern­ment’s Lima Plan, a move that would have seen the trou­bled coun­try pay­ing US$1,8 bil­lion in ar­rears to pre­ferred in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions (IFIs) and ac­cess US$2 bil­lion in new fund­ing, is un­der threat as many are lob­by­ing against it. An­other ham­string on eco­nomic growth is the crip­pled tourism sec­tor. A ban on ivory im­ports and in­va­sion of con­ser­van­cies and end­less road­blocks is hurt­ing the sec­tor. A 15% tax im­posed on pay­ments for ac­com­mo­da­tion and tourism ser­vices by for­eign vis­i­tors has left a huge dent on the sec­tor with in­dus­try play­ers warn­ing that the tax makes them un­com­pet­i­tive. A Zim­babwe Coun­cil for Tourism re­port re­veals that due to the value-added tax im­posed by govern­ment re­veals that the coun­try could have lost close to a stag­ger­ing US$124 mil­lion in tourism rev­enue last year. Eco­nomic an­a­lyst John Robert­son said it was a pity that govern­ment thinks that fund­ing from abroad will re­vive the econ­omy. “Govern­ment might be re­jected by the Chi­nese be­cause we have failed to re­mit in the past. It is a pity that we are banking on fund­ing from abroad to re­vive the econ­omy which was crip­pled by poli­cies and the de­struc­tion of prop­erty rights,” said Robert­son. “It is govern­ment’s mis­taken think­ing that the econ­omy will grow by 6,6% and pro­jec­tions on re­cov­ery will not work. Al­ready there is no growth tak­ing place this year and this shows that govern­ment is not telling the truth, if it is not work­ing now why should we be­lieve that it will work next time?” Econ­o­mist and Buy Zim­babwe chair­man Oswell Binha said govern­ment could be left with an egg on the face should the econ­omy slides into re­ces­sion, as an­a­lysts project. “Zim­babwe un­der its cur­rent cir­cum­stances will never achieve any growth be­yond 4%, the man­i­fes­ta­tion of in­abil­ity to max­imise on what we have as ma­jor driv­ers of the econ­omy is af­fect­ing us,” Binha said.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20180215,North Korea’s en­trepreneurs defy odds,"AS NORTH Korean ath­letes par­tic­i­pate in the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, you might be cu­ri­ous about how or­di­nary North Kore­ans live un­der the grip of Kim Jong Un. Is ev­ery­one starv­ing and march­ing in lock­step? While poverty does ex­ist and North Kore­ans don’t live freely in­side the com­mu­nist na­tion, more or­di­nary cit­i­zens are qui­etly be­com­ing en­trepreneurs. As busi­ness is in­cre­men­tally tol­er­ated yet mon­i­tored by the regime — ev­ery­one from mil­len­ni­als to wealth­ier pro­fes­sion­als are boot­strap­ping ven­tures in­side the world’s most to­tal­i­tar­ian state. “It’s con­strained and cam­ou­flaged, but it’s cap­i­tal­ism none­the­less,” says So­keel Park, di­rec­tor of re­search and strat­egy at Lib­erty in North Korea, an in­ter­na­tional NGO that sup­ports North Korean de­fec­tors. Strains of cap­i­tal­ism emerged in this com­mu­nist so­ci­ety back in the 1990s as mar­kets popped up across the coun­try to cope with the famine. Here North Kore­ans be­came en­trepreneurs out of ne­ces­sity to trade for food and other ne­ces­si­ties. Over the years the prac­tice ex­panded and the regime, un­able to feed its own peo­ple, was forced to tol­er­ate the mar­keti­sa­tion. Ac­cord­ing to Daily NK, an on­line news­pa­per fo­cused on North Korean is­sues, more than 5 mil­lion North Kore­ans, or 20 per­cent of the pop­u­la­tion, are now di­rectly or in­di­rectly in­volved in the gen­eral mar­kets. This grow­ing tol­er­ance for free en­ter­prise has con­trib­uted to ex­pand­ing phys­i­cal, out­door mar­ket spa­ces that per­me­ate ci­ties and the coun­try­side. Com­prised of stalls and roughly akin to an out­door flea mar­ket, en­trepreneurs con­duct cash trans­ac­tions in Korean won, Chi­nese yuan and even the US dol­lar. Ven­tures range in size and type — of­fer­ing ev­ery­thing from con­sumer goods, like food and cloth­ing, to ser­vices in­clud­ing hair­cuts and trans­porta­tion, ac­cord­ing to a re­port on North Korea’s mar­keti­sa­tion and de­tails from North Korean de­fec­tors. The net ef­fect is a bud­ding, en­tre­pre­neur­ial ecosys­tem that is evolv­ing beyond mom-and­pop stalls run by house­wives. The out­door mar­kets in turn are part of a larger, emerg­ing busi­ness frame­work that in­cludes a start-up boot­camp and gov­ern­ment-sup­ported tech zones. State of­fi­cials are in on side hus­tles, too, help­ing to cre­ate a hy­brid, pri­vate-state model of mar­keti­sa­tion. Not even the eco­nomic sanc­tions im­posed by the US1 and in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity is ebbing this move­ment. Just to clar­ify, North Korea is not the next Sil­i­con Val­ley. Chal­lenges for en­trepreneurs are for­mi­da­ble. Ob­sta­cles in­clude lack of mod­ern in­fra­struc­ture and trans­porta­tion, no wide­spread in­ter­net ac­cess and ab­sence of ro­bust bank-lend­ing ac­tiv­ity. Mi­cro en­trepreneurs aren’t sell­ing their goods on­line. And there’s noth­ing equiv­a­lent to a ven­ture cap­i­tal frame­work. In­ter­na­tional sanc­tions also make large-scale busi­ness and trade ac­tiv­ity across bor­ders dif­fi­cult. De­spite these chal­lenges, scrappy en­trepreneurs are self-fi­nanc­ing their own small busi­nesses. They’re get­ting ac­cess to of­ten Chi­nese-made goods that ar­rive through the por­ous North Korea–China bor­der. Lack of in­ter­net ac­cess and a mod­ern dig­i­tal land­scape can in fact spark in­ge­nu­ity. For ex­am­ple, if you ac­quire Chi­nese-made ap­parel through a mid­dle­man, you might re­sort to an ana­logue, guer­rilla mar­ket­ing tac­tic. Get your most at­trac­tive — and tallest — fe­male friends to model out­fits and strut up and down an out­door North Korean mar­ket, as one de­fec­tor de­tails in a new film on North Korea’s mil­len­nial en­trepreneurs called “Jang­madang Gen­er­a­tion” (or mar­ket gen­er­a­tion). Roughly 20 per­cent of North Korea’s pop­u­la­tion of 25 mil­lion rely on the out­door mar­kets alone, ac­cord­ing to a re­port pub­lished last year by Daily NK. Beyond the mar­ket spa­ces, some North Kore­ans are par­tic­i­pat­ing in busi­ness train­ing of­fered in­side the coun­try. Equiv­a­lent to a start-up boot­camp, the pro­gramme is run by Cho­son Ex­change, a Sin­ga­pore-based non­profit that sup­ports North Korean en­trepreneurs. Cho­son Ex­change men­tors its North Korean part­ners to in­cu­bate and de­velop their roughly 30 start-up ven­tures and early-stage busi­ness ideas through work­shops and ad­di­tional ini­tia­tives. Ven­tures range from gin­seng-in­fused face cream to an elec­tric­ity surge pro­tec­tor. Stu­dents are cu­ri­ous about ad­vances like drones and nan­otech­nol­ogy. Train­ing work­shops in­clude lec­tures by vis­it­ing foreigners from or­ga­ni­za­tions in­clud­ing Face­book and The Econ­o­mist. Each work­shop in­cludes roughly 80 to 120 stu­dents, and the ses­sions are held in Py­ongyang or Py­ong­song, lo­cated north of the cap­i­tal. On rare oc­ca­sions a hand­ful of North Kore­ans have trav­elled to Sin­ga­pore for in­tern­ships and skills train­ing, but most ses­sions are held in the North. The work­shops fo­cus on en­tre­pre­neur­ial skills and eco­nomic pol­icy. “There is a hunger in this coun­try for peo­ple to start their own busi­ness,” said Ian Ben­nett, out­reach co­or­di­na­tor for Cho­son Ex­change. “North Kore­ans are fairly open in say­ing they want to open busi­nesses,” said Ben­nett. “Profit is not a dirty word.” North Kore­ans have dab­bled in free en­ter­prise for years in a kind of gray mar­ket with pre­scribed rules. Af­ter the North’s state food sys­tem col­lapsed in the 1990s, peo­ple turned to mar­kets to feed them­selves. Based on in­ter­views with North Korean de­fec­tors and ex­perts over the last few years, it’s ap­par­ent the mar­kets are ir­re­versible and en­trenched fix­tures in the econ­omy. — CNBC.com.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20170807,DOOR ON IVORY TRADE CLOS­ING FAST:,"THE World Ele­phant So­ci­ety (WES), a nascent not­for-profit US con­ser­va­tion group, last Thurs­day (Au­gust 3) crushed $8 mil­lion ivory’s worth to dust, fol­low­ing in Kenya’s self-ab­sorbed foot­steps from a year ago. It is a stunt that is as sick­en­ing as it is nour­ish­ing. Sick­en­ing in the sense that the de­struc­tion took place in the US district of Man­hat­tan in New York City, far from Zim­babwe’s Hwange Na­tional Park or Namibia’s Etosha Na­tional Park - the real nat­u­ral ele­phant habi­tats. Sick­en­ing in the sense that while the WES views the de­struc­tion of ivory a noble ges­ture, other key stake­hold­ers in ele­phant con­ser­va­tion such as Zim­babwe, Namibia and South Africa, which host sig­nif­i­cant ele­phant pop­u­la­tions, do not. And nour­ish­ing — only marginally — in the sense that the world still cares so much that cer­tain agents are willing to go the full mile to pro­tect an­i­mals faced with ex­tinc­tion, even when the ways they choose to demon­strate that con­cern in­fringe on the rights of others. It is a con­tra­dic­tion that were it not for its se­ri­ous­ness — the pro­tec­tion of one of the world’s few re­main­ing iconic wild an­i­mals — would be funny Apart from those an­i­mals held cap­tive in zoos, the US is not known to host any ele­phants of note in the wild, if at all, even though it is a ma­jor fun­der of ele­phant con­ser­va­tion else­where. So, what would be the sig­nif­i­cance of de­stroy­ing 2 tonnes of “il­le­gal” ivory in a ridicu­lously af­flu­ent com­mer­cial and fi­nan­cial cen­tre like Man­hat­tan? To cap­ture the at­ten­tion of the world’s big­gest fun­ders of ele­phant con­ser­va­tion, that’s why - ef­fec­tively cut­ting the flow of aid to those coun­tries con­sid­ered rogue, those that have con­tin­ued to press for le­git­i­mate trade in ele­phant tusks. The ul­ti­mate mes­sage though is to re­in­force global calls for a com­plete ban in com­mer­cial ivory trade, as cham­pi­oned by African states that have failed in ele­phant con­ser­va­tion, such as Kenya and their back­ers in the West. It is a mes­sage for which Kenya was un­flinch­ing when it razed 105 tonnes of ivory by fire last year, in a des­per­ate grand stand­ing act of the high­est or­der. Kenya’s plan was to in­flu­ence the out­come of the CITES meet­ing hosted by South Africa last Septem­ber, which it did, as the con­fer­ence up­held the global ban in ivory trade - in place for the past 10 years. Wealthy Western fun­ders love this kind of pos­tur­ing by a loyal sub­ject, and with a $150 mil­lion bounty from the US to sup­port its wildlife con­ser­va­tion for the next decade, Kenya had earned its stripes. But it is how Kenya’s ap­par­ent self-serv­ing ac­tions are be­gin­ning to gain cur­rency with cam­paign­ers, as Zim­babwe’s calls — and those of South Africa and Namibia — for lib­er­al­is­ing the trade in ivory die a quiet death. The World Ele­phant So­ci­ety is us­ing the Au­gust 3 ivory crush­ing event to mark the be­gin­ning of a 10 day count­down to the World Ele­phant Day on Au­gust 12, and to drive home the mes­sage ivory is not for sale. Ivory sales could only fuel the il­le­gal killing of ele­phants, it says. Ban cru­sade get­ting stronger We pre­dicted last Oc­to­ber, af­ter the fail­ure at the South African leg of the CITES meet­ing, that the anti-ivory cru­sade will more than ever be­fore get much stronger, as those in favour weaken. We are al­ready be­gin­ning to see these pre­dic­tions slowly com­ing to pass. Now, with two years be­fore the next Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species (CITES) con­fer­ence, there is a real chance that the de­bate on com­mer­cial ivory sales will close per­ma­nently, leav­ing Zim­babwe stuck with a 96 tonne pile of un­sold tusks. En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Op­pah Muchin­guri-Kashiri’s fears of “wildlife colo­nial­ism” will be com­plete, should that hap­pen. And the min­is­ter ap­peared re­signed to the no­tion the global ban on ivory may never be lifted, when she ad­dressed Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans at a meet­ing in Harare on July 7. Crit­i­cis­ing the West for turn­ing a blind eye to Zim­babwe “ex­celling in wildlife con­ser­va­tion”, Mrs Muchin­guri-Kashiri pleaded “we should be re­warded for these ef­forts through sus­tain­able util­i­sa­tion, but in­stead we are be­ing pun­ished through trade re­stric­tions.” The only rea­son that the world’s at­ten­tion is cen­tred on Zim­babwe’s 80 000 ele­phant herd, the world’s sec­ond largest, is be­cause the coun­try has largely man­aged to keep poach­ers at bay, and to grow the herd pru­den­tially, even on a shoe­string bud­get, she said. The Zim­babwe Parks and Wildlife Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity (ZimParks) spends around $30 mil­lion each year in wildlife pro­tec­tion. But un­like Kenya that en­joys for­eign sup­port, ZimParks self-funds, with only about 1 per­cent of its an­nual spend­ing funded by the Trea­sury. That bud­getary sup­port has since been cut, the En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter told Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans. ZimParks is now ex­pected to op­er­ate com­mer­cially, and it has be­gun this jour­ney by sell­ing off its sa­fari prop­er­ties to those that can bet­ter man­age it. It’s a des­per­ate mea­sure to raise funds for con­ser­va­tion, by any means, where 96 tonnes of ivory could have eas­ily raised $384 mil­lion, to use the WES’ val­u­a­tions for its 2 tonne ivory cache. To­gether with South Africa and Namibia, Zim­babwe has sulked at the idea of de­stroy­ing ivory as a con­ser­va­tion strat­egy. In­stead, it has al­ways ar­gued that sell­ing the ivory, legally, and rein­vest­ing the pro­ceeds into wildlife pro­tec­tion, made so much sense. The trio failed to force through the adop­tion of the De­ci­sion Mak­ing Mech­a­nism, which would al­low trade in ivory in fu­ture, when South Africa hosted the CITES con­fer­ence last Septem­ber. Even plans for a once-off sale were shot down. The plan was re­jected by an over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity, af­ter only 20 mem­bers of the Con­ven­tion on In­ter­na­tional Trade in En­dan­gered Species voted in favour, and 76 against the mech­a­nism — in dis­pute for 10 years. It is al­most a decade since Zim­babwe’s last com­mer­cial sale in ivory. A once off sale of 3 700kg to Japan and China on Novem­ber 1, 2008, gen­er­ated about $500 000, which was duly de­clared to CITES, ac­cord­ing to ZimParks of­fi­cials. But a coun­try like Zim­babwe could do more with a 96-tonne ivory in­ven­tory sold legally than burnt or crushed. Ac­cord­ing to a 2014 re­port, CITES ad­mits that the high poach­ing in­ci­dents in Africa re­sult mainly from poverty, weak gov­er­nance struc­tures and poor fund­ing. Burn­ing or crush­ing brings in nei­ther the money needed to man­age wildlife sus­tain­ably nor the fi­nan­cial where­withal needed to halve poverty or tame poach­ing. We have queried in the past: if il­le­gal ivory sales are truly a cri­sis, why not just make the trade le­git? Past CITES meet­ing have con­sis­tently failed to bring or­der, trans­parency and le­gal­ity to the cru­cial is­sue of trade in ivory, of­ten times sim­ply on ac­count of emo­tion from those African coun­tries fail­ing to ef­fec­tively man­age their wildlife - and those from the West with money to buy the weak, never con­sid­er­ing Zim­babwe’s sin­gle-handed ef­forts at suc­cess­fully con­serv­ing a global re­source. There is lit­tle con­vic­tion fu­ture CITES con­fer­ences will ar­rive at de­ci­sions any dif­fer­ent from those reached in the past, or for coun­tries like Kenya, well-funded from abroad, to ap­pre­ci­ate Zim­babwe’s need to sell its ivory. Like­wise, we re­it­er­ate our pre­vi­ous calls, that if there was a time Zim­babwe needed to con­sider op­tions out­side the Con­ven­tion, and, pos­si­bly re-eval­u­ate its mem­ber­ship, this would be it.

zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170308,Women are own lib­er­a­tors,"IF more Zim­bab­wean women would be­gin to be agents of the change they want to see, their eco­nomic sta­tus would im­prove im­mensely. Women should lib­er­ate them­selves from the so­cial, eco­nomic and cul­tural bar­ri­ers that hin­der their de­vel­op­ment. The econ­omy and de­vel­op­ment of Zim­babwe lies in the hands of women as they are sta­tis­ti­cally more than men in pop­u­la­tion at 52 per­cent. If you em­power a woman you em­power a na­tion. Zim­babwe’s in­for­mal sec­tor is driven by more women than men. I will speak in my own ca­pac­ity as a mem­ber of the Harare Cham­ber of Small Medium En­ter­prises and the projects man­ager of the Harare In­for­mal Traders’ Coun­cil. I joined the sec­tor from an as­so­ci­a­tion I be­longed to dur­ing the times I traded go­ing to China to buy goods and sell at a flea mar­ket and a small shop I owned back then. There were a lot of women then in the in­for­mal sec­tor and even more so now. In one meet­ing, some­one asked, “What is the dif­fer­ence be­tween the in­for­mal sec­tor and small to medium en­ter­prises (SME’s)?” I had to give a sim­ple explanation that, “SME’S are ei­ther reg­is­tered with a cer­tifi­cate of in­cor­po­ra­tion and op­er­at­ing from a for­mal busi­ness place on a regular ba­sis un­like the in­for­mal trader who might be here to­day and nowhere to­mor­row, or ei­ther sell­ing toma­toes be­cause they are in sea­son and what­ever goes the next day, they are not reg­is­tered and strive for the mo­ment and be­cause of a cri­sis.” The Harare Cham­ber of SMEs is the board that is sup­posed to rep­re­sent all the SMEs in Harare. The or­gan­i­sa­tion rep­re­sents the needs of the peo­ple and is sup­posed to bring about change to the sec­tor. What I re­alised was in the In­for­mal Sec­tor Board, I am the only woman in the ex­ec­u­tive board and in the Cham­ber; we had to fight to have women elected into the ex­ec­u­tive board. All top po­si­tions are oc­cu­pied by men and pow­er­ful po­si­tions are cir­cu­lated within them­selves. Zim­babwe in its at­ti­tudes and set up is still a pa­tri­ar­chal so­ci­ety which con­tin­ues to deny women equal op­por­tu­ni­ties. Women have to fight for po­si­tions of power and con­trol in the pri­vate sphere and even in the pub­lic sphere. Stereo­typ­i­cal mind­sets of men that women are use­less and voice­less con­tinue to pre­vail in th­ese spa­ces hence not much con­sul­ta­tion from women is done when de­vel­op­men­tal pro­grammes are be­ing put in place, yet it is very im­por­tant to fos­ter women into en­trepreneur­ship. Women are key to un­lock­ing the eco­nomic po­ten­tial and de­vel­op­ment of Zim­babwe and they need to be taken se­ri­ously. Women’s en­trepreneur­ship and em­pow­er­ment is a good ve­hi­cle to achieve growth and re­duce poverty. How­ever, the mul­ti­ple roles of women hin­der their progress and some­times limit them from ris­ing up as fast as their male coun­ter­parts. De­vel­op­ment is not pos­si­ble with­out par­tic­i­pa­tion of women in de­ci­sion mak­ing po­si­tions. More women should take up top po­si­tions and break the “glass ceil­ings” that men have cre­ated in the pub­lic sphere. Even though Zim­bab­wean women are hard work­ing, ed­u­cated and skilled, they are con­stantly de­nied op­por­tu­ni­ties and are looked down upon. Banks deny women credit loans as they have no col­lat­eral and are not bank­able. Ac­cess to cap­i­tal to grow their busi­nesses is al­ways a chal­lenge and lack of knowl­edge of skills and tech­nol­ogy also hin­ders women from mov­ing for­ward. It is time fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions gave women equip­ment and ma­chin­ery as a way of al­low­ing them to ben­e­fit from loan schemes. In most cases amounts as lit­tle as $300 are given to start up busi­nesses, what kind of busi­ness would re­ally grow from such an amount, and this is payable in three months with in­ter­est. One won­ders what kind of busi­ness wiould have im­me­di­ate re­turns. This model of as­sis­tance does not de­velop the woman but only in­creases her prob­lems and bur­dens and cre­ates more in­for­mal busi­ness models. Mi­cro fi­nanciers should in­tro­duce small ma­chin­ery for man­u­fac­tur­ing such as brick mould­ing ma­chines, peanut but­ter mak­ing ma­chines, gas grillers, dough­nut mak­ing ma­chines, deter­gent ma­chines, and al­low women to pur­chase them in or­der to have vi­able busi­nesses that can re­pay the loans given to­wards the ma­chines. Th­ese ma­chines should be their col­lat­eral un­til they are paid off, in that way a woman would be em­pow­ered. Such items should be se­cured for women in­stead of giv­ing them cash, this is in the hope of grow­ing women in busi­ness and mov­ing them from the men­tal­ity of just merely buy­ing and sell­ing to be­ing pro­duc­ers who can make their own prod­ucts and even ex­port to other coun­tries. In the agri­cul­tural sec­tor, a lot of women are farm labour­ers only a few own the land, as agri­cul­ture is the back­bone of Zim­babwe it would be very im­por­tant for gov­ern­ment to al­lo­cate women more land and in­puts di­rectly. Men are the ones who re­ceive in­puts such as trac­tors and diesel in their names. In most cases, in­puts are sold and not utilised to ben­e­fit the farm in any way and women have no say. Men as the heads of house­holds, have pres­tige and more rights to land than women. Women’s con­tri­bu­tion to agri­cul­tural pro­duc­tion has a mul­ti­ply­ing ef­fect on the de­vel­op­ment of the coun­try and eman­ci­pa­tion of women. It is clear that even from the on­set, most of the agri­cul­tural sur­plus was pro­duced by women al­though it was con­trolled by men. When the cheque comes from the Grain Mar­ket­ing Board or To­bacco Auc­tion floors the fa­ther of the home has the power to con­trol what the money does, leav­ing women voice­less in the fruits of their labour. Al­though there has been a turn where women in Zim­babwe are re­al­is­ing that they should take part in eco­nomic growth, there are too many chal­lenges that hin­der their de­vel­op­ment, the gen­der dy­nam­ics al­ways play a role in the de­vel­op­ment pro­cesses. Women have also taken an op­por­tu­nity in min­ing where they have been al­lo­cated claims and some are min­ing as groups, it is a chal­lenge for most to get the rel­e­vant equip­ment for min­ing as it is costly and fi­nances are scarce, most part­ners also want to part­ner with men. A re­search by the World Bank high­lighted that so­ci­eties that dis­crim­i­nate by gen­der tend to ex­pe­ri­ence less rapid eco­nomic growth and poverty re­duc­tion than so­ci­eties that treat males and fe­males more equally, and that so­cial gen­der dis­par­i­ties pro­duce eco­nom­i­cally in­ef­fi­cient out­comes. Women in Zim­babwe should not just be viewed as re­li­able, pro­duc­tive and cheap labour force but they should also be viewed as the right ve­hi­cle for bring­ing a change and a force worth in­vest­ing in. The recog­ni­tion of women as hard­work­ing, in­flu­en­tial, pro­duc­tive and ef­fi­cient dis­trib­u­tors of ser­vices and goods within the house­hold and coun­try in gen­eral should be enough rea­son to el­e­vate women to po­si­tions of power and de­ci­sion mak­ing where they will be able to con­trib­ute to in­no­va­tive and sus­tain­able eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment of the peo­ple of Zim­babwe as a whole with­out putting per­sonal in­ter­ests first. Women are known to be self­less and they have seen Zim­babwe through most of its tough­est times. When they were food short­ages in the coun­try, women were the ones cross­ing bor­ders and bring­ing food to the ta­ble. Even in the tough­est times, it is the women who stay home and look af­ter the fam­ily while men mi­grate to seek greener pas­tures. Hence the only bold change we can make is to change a woman’s life in or­der to change the na­tion. Agnes Ma­gunje is a gen­der ac­tivist. She is driven by women’s em­pow­er­ment, a voice of the voice­less. She is cur­rently Study­ing Women and Gen­der Stud­ies at Women’s Univer­sity in Africa. She’s also an ex­ec­u­tive mem­ber of the Harare Cham­ber of SME’s and Projects Man­ager at Harare In­for­mal Traders Coun­cil.",津巴布韦
zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20160527,Ban for pres­i­dent whis­pers grow loud,"UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral Mr Ban Ki-moon yes­ter­day called on all sig­na­to­ries to the Paris Agree­ment on Cli­mate Change (Cop21), to rat­ify it as soon pos­si­ble, amid other press­ing global chal­lenges. Pre­sent­ing his key­note ad­dress dur­ing the of­fi­cial open­ing cer­e­mony of the 11th edi­tion of the Jeju Fo­rum for Peace and Pros­per­ity, which opened here on May 25, the UN chief, who is strongly tipped as a po­ten­tial can­di­date for South Korea’s 2017 pres­i­den­tial elec­tions told del­e­gates that cli­mate change re­mained a ma­jor chal­lenge, say­ing that Asia was “crit­i­cal to cli­mate ac­tion, ac­counted for nearly a third of all global green­house emis­sions (and) is also a source of so­lu­tions.” Pres­i­dent Mu­gabe on April 22 joined about 170 world lead­ers at the UN head­quar­ters in New York to sign the his­toric Paris Agree­ment and pledged, “We can re­duce our green­house emis­sions by 33 per­cent be­low the pro­jected busi­ness as usual en­ergy emis­sions per capita by 2020.” Ac­cord­ing to ob­servers, spec­u­la­tion about Mr Ban’s fu­ture among Kore­ans and the in­ter­na­tional me­dia has been fu­elled by his ap­pear­ance at the Jeju Fo­rum, barely a year be­fore the end of his term of of­fice with the UN. The three-day Davos-like Jeju Fo­rum, which runs un­der the theme: “Asia’s New Or­der and Co­op­er­a­tive Lead­er­ship”, is be­ing at­tended by about 4 000 del­e­gates from 60 coun­tries who in­clude high-level gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, busi­ness ex­ec­u­tives, aca­demics, youths and ac­tivists. Other key­note speak­ers in­cluded Malaysia’s former Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir bin Mo­hamad, Ja­panese former PM Tomi­ichi Mu­rayama, New Zealand ex-PM Jim Bol­ger, Sin­ga­pore’s former pre­mier Goh Chok Tong and Italy’s former PM En­rico Letta. Mr Ban’s ad­dress ze­roed on four fun­da­men­tal themes: global ac­tion, re­gional co­op­er­a­tion sta­bil­ity on the Korean Penin­sula, and uni­ver­sal hu­man rights. The world’s top diplo­mat also urged Asia to learn from Africa, Latin Amer­ica and Europe in re­solv­ing out­stand­ing dif­fer­ences, say­ing that peo­ple should take pride in their coun­tries: “It is time to agree on borders that are dis­puted (and) rise above con­flict­ing in­ter­pre­ta­tions of his­tory (and) fo­cus on the fu­ture,” he said. Mr Ban added, “I have seen this work on other con­ti­nents. Latin Amer­ica, Africa and Europe have suc­cess­ful agree­ments and or­gan­i­sa­tions. They helped ease ten­sions and pre­vent con­flicts. There are no win­ners in vi­o­lent con­flicts, only lost gen­er­a­tions, greater poverty and deep bit­ter­ness.” Turn­ing to the mil­len­nium gen­er­a­tion, the UN Sec­re­tary Gen­eral called on them to be vi­sion­ar­ies who in this digital age must look be­yond their coun­tries’ borders. “These national borders do not mean much these days. We must make sure our younger gen­er­a­tion be­come global ci­ti­zens, with global vi­sion. Look be­yond your national borders what other peo­ple are do­ing, how they are do­ing,” he said. Former Malaysia PM Mr Mo­hamad crit­i­cised war as a means to re­solv­ing con­flicts, and called on lead­ers to seek peace­ful means in­clud­ing “ne­go­ti­a­tion” and “ar­bi­tra­tion” to re­solve con­flicts. Six­teen jour­nal­ists from 16 coun­tries that in­cluded Zim­babwe, An­gola, Mon­go­lia, Peru, Hon­duras, China, France, the USA among oth­ers also at­tended the fo­rum at the in­vi­ta­tion of the Korea Foun­da­tion. They took part in a panel dis­cus­sion of a pre­sen­ta­tion by Pro­fes­sor Jaechun Kim of So­gang Univer­sity ti­tled, “Korean uni­fi­ca­tion and in­ter­na­tional so­ci­ety: The role of in­ter­na­tional me­dia.” The Jeju Fo­rum is an in­ter­na­tional plat­form es­tab­lished more than 10 years ago when Mr Ban was South Korea’s min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs. It is a fo­rum where world lead­ers and aca­demics come to­gether to talk about the new or­der, the sig­nif­i­cance of co­op­er­a­tive lead­er­ship and it’s im­ple­men­ta­tion.

zw,The Herald (Zimbabwe),20150924,"A world con­vulsed
by crises","OVER the past month, the world has been gripped by a pro­lif­er­a­tion of crises — eco­nomic, geopo­lit­i­cal, so­cial — erupt­ing on a daily ba­sis, in­ter­act­ing with each other, and rais­ing the spec­tre of a global calamity. On the eco­nomic front, in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial mar­kets have swung wildly be­tween mas­sive gains and losses, as gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks have sought des­per­ately to counter the im­pact of a gath­er­ing slump in pro­duc­tion and in­vest­ment that threat­ens to top­ple the fi­nan­cial house of cards built up since the Wall Street crash of 2008. The Chi­nese econ­omy, world cap­i­tal­ism’s premier cheap-labour plat­form, which pro­vided the bulk of eco­nomic growth af­ter the fi­nan­cial crash, is founder­ing, along with a host of other so-called “emerg­ing mar­ket economies.” On the geopo­lit­i­cal front, ten­sions be­tween the ma­jor cap­i­tal­ist pow­ers are sharp­en­ing un­der the im­pact of so­cial dis­as­ters pro­duced by im­pe­ri­al­ist wars that have rav­aged en­tire coun­tries, from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ye­men and large parts of Africa. The ru­ina­tion of much of Cen­tral Asia and the Mid­dle East by US im­pe­ri­al­ism and its Euro­pean and Gulf al­lies has un­leashed a flood of des­per­ate refugees on a scale not seen since the end of World War II. Hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grants pour­ing into Europe have ex­posed the chasm be­tween the sol­i­dar­ity and sup­port for the refugees felt by broad masses of peo­ple and the in­dif­fer­ence and in­hu­man­ity of gov­ern­ments both in­side and out­side of Europe. The cri­sis has si­mul­ta­ne­ously in­ten­si­fied the con­flicts that are tear­ing apart the Euro­pean Union. Washington has es­ca­lated its diplo­matic and mil­i­tary pres­sure on Rus­sia and China amid new calls for all-out war to over­throw the regime of Pres­i­dent Bashar al-As­sad in Syria. Around the world, the tra­di­tional par­ties of bour­geois rule, both right and “left,” are col­laps­ing un­der the pres­sure of un­prece­dented lev­els of so­cial in­equal­ity and mount­ing pop­u­lar anger and dis­con­tent. The rul­ing elites cast about for new means to sup­press the class strug­gle and pre-empty the de­vel­op­ment of an in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cal move­ment of the work­ing class. They in­creas­ingly rely on pseudo-left par­ties — Syriza, the Ger­man Left Party, the French New Anti-cap­i­tal­ist Party, the In­ter­na­tional So­cial­ist Or­ga­ni­za­tion in the US — to polit- ically dis­arm the work­ing class and pro­vide them time to im­pose their re­ac­tionary poli­cies. Some sec­tions of the rul­ing class toy with the pro­mo­tion of au­thor­i­tar­ian and fascis­tic fig­ures bas­ing them­selves on racist and anti-im­mi­grant dem­a­gogy. Oth­ers experiment with “left” forces — Tsipras in Greece, Cor­byn in Bri­tain, San­ders in the US — to con­tain and dis­si­pate pop­u­lar op­po­si­tion and pre­pare the ground for a vi­o­lent set­tling of ac­counts with the work­ing class. Cri­sis is not the ex­cep­tion, but the rule. The very speed of events, with vir­tu­ally no in­ter­vals of calm be­tween the storms, denotes an in­ten­si­fy­ing and pro­found gen­eral cri­sis. All of these de­vel­op­ments are man­i­fes­ta­tions of a his­toric cri­sis of the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem of cap­i­tal­ism. Within the frame­work of cap­i­tal­ism, based on pri­vate own­er­ship of the means of pro­duc­tion and the di­vi­sion of the world into ri­val na­tion-states, there is no ra­tio­nal or pro­gres­sive so­lu­tion. The bour­geoisie it­self is hope­lessly di­vided — ex­cept when it comes to im­pos­ing its cri­sis on the backs of work­ing peo­ple. It thrashes about in per­plex­ity, in the end opt­ing for des­per­ate and vi­o­lent mea­sures. If the fate of mankind is left in its hands, the in­evitable out­come will be a third world war and nu­clear an­ni­hi­la­tion. The world po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in­creas­ingly as­sumes the form of the 1930s. As Leon Trot­sky wrote in 1938 in the Tran­si­tional Pro­gramme, the found­ing pro­gramme of the Fourth In­ter­na­tional; “Un­der the in­creas­ing ten­sion of cap­i­tal­ist dis­in­te­gra­tion, im­pe­ri­al­ist an­tag­o­nisms reach an im­passe at the height of which sep­a­rate clashes and bloody lo­cal dis­tur­bances (Ethiopia, Spain, the Far East, Cen­tral Europe) must in­evitably co­a­lesce into a con­fla­gra­tion of world di­men­sions.” Trot­sky coined the phrase “death agony of cap­i­tal­ism” to de­note the na­ture of the epoch — our epoch to­day. The cas­cad­ing ex­pres­sions of eco­nomic, geopo­lit­i­cal and so­cial cri­sis were, he ex­plained, char­ac­ter­is­tic of a pre-rev­o­lu­tion­ary state of so­ci­ety. The re­sis­tance of the masses grows in op­po­si­tion to in­creas­ing poverty amidst ob­scene wealth at the top, along with mount­ing re­pres­sion and the loom­ing threat of world war. The cen­tral and ur­gent ques­tion posed be­fore mankind, Trot­sky in­sisted, was the de­vel­op­ment of the po­lit­i­cal con­scious­ness of the work­ing class and the build­ing of rev­o­lu­tion­ary lead­er­ship. Then, as now, the fate of hu­man­ity was con­cen­trated in the ques­tion: Which would de­velop more rapidly, the de­scent of cap­i­tal­ism into bar­barism and war or the po­lit­i­cally con­scious strug­gle of the in­ter­na­tional work­ing class for so­cial­ist revo­lu­tion? — World So­cial­ist Web­site.",津巴布韦

global warm­ing","GLOBAL ter­ror­ism re­mains one of the fore­most chal­lenges of our time. In an evil, bar­baric at­tack last Fri­day, Is­lamic State mil­i­tants struck a con­cert hall, a sta­dium, restau­rants and bars in Paris. One hun­dred and twenty-nine peo­ple died, and about 350 were wounded, some crit­i­cally. The world is united in grief. Iron­i­cally, in two weeks, Paris will be the fo­cus of an­other ur­gent global chal­lenge. The world will de­scend upon Paris to talk about cli­mate change. The con­fer­ence of par­ties of the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change is the largest rit­ual of global waf­fle. This 21st con­fer­ence is un­likely to be dif­fer­ent. This is de­spite the fact that dan­ger­ous warm­ing is on the march and time is run­ning out. Dan­ger­ous global warm­ing, owing to the rapid ac­cu­mu­la­tion of green­house gases, is linked to our de­pen­dence on and ad­dic­tion to fos­sil fu­els. More­over, car­bon emis­sions are strongly cor­re­lated with eco­nomic growth. The world’s most ad­vanced economies are also the worst pol­luters. China and the United States of Amer­ica lead the pack of the coun­tries that foul our at­mos­phere the most. The pos­i­tive as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween eco­nomic out­put and green­house gas emis­sions has caused gov­ern­ments in the de­vel­op­ing world to ar­gue that ag­gres­sive mea­sures to curb emis­sions would un­der­mine growth and pros­per­ity tar­gets. In a sense, ev­ery na­tion feels en­ti­tled to pol­lute its way to pros­per­ity. Here in Africa, we imag­ine that our share of car­bon emis­sions is neg­li­gi­ble. Hence, the bur­den of re­spon­si­bil­ity for ac­tion to curb emis­sions and slow down global warm­ing lies with the in­dus­trial West and the ad­vanced economies of Asia. At ev­ery suc­ces­sive con­fer­ence of par­ties, Africans have ar­gued that they are the vic­tims of the ad­verse im­pacts of global warm­ing caused mostly by de­vel­oped and mid­dle-in­come economies. Africans have ar­gued that they are in­or­di­nately ex­posed, and, hence sig­nif­i­cantly vul­ner­a­ble to the im­pacts of cli­mate change. For nearly 25 years, we have known that ur­gent ac­tion was needed to fore­stall green­house gas emis­sions and pre­vent dam­ag­ing and ir­re­versible im­pacts on ecosys­tems, economies and so­ci­eties. But we have failed to take any ur­gent mea­sures to en­able a global shift to a low-car­bon econ­omy. Gov­ern­ments and dom­i­nant pol­i­cy­mak­ers are not con­vinced that there is such a thing as a low car­bon, green growth path­way. Pol­icy wonks and politi­cians in de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing coun­tries of­ten ar­gue that ag­gres­sive ac­tion to curb green­house gases will have dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences on eco­nomic growth, jobs, and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion. This in my view is bunk, grade “A” id­iocy. On the con­trary, if we don’t act now the full and com­plex im­pact of cli­mate change could wipe out up to 20 per­cent of global GDP an­nu­ally. Ex­perts have warned that we are firmly on the path to a 40°C warmer planet char­ac­terised by ex­treme weather, un­prece­dented sea level rise, dis­ease, de­clin­ing global food stocks, un­prece­dented ex­tinc­tions and loss of bio­di­ver­sity and as­so­ci­ated ecosys­tem ser­vices. As we go to Paris, we must re­mind our­selves that even though the pos­si­bil­ity of a glob­ally bind­ing agree­ment is re­mote, the stakes are high and time is run­ning out. It is hard to imag­ine an or­derly, peace­ful world that is 40 De­grees Cel­sius warmer. In Africa, hun­gry and in­firm cit­i­zens pour­ing out on the streets, starv­ing refugees wait­ing to cross bor­ders and rag­ing con­flicts over re­sources, es­pe­cially wa­ter and pas­ture, will push the world into ir­re­deemable tur­moil. Ma­jor cities like New York, Van­cou­ver, Hong Kong, and Dar es Salaam could be washed off the face of the earth. Bru­tal sum­mer heat waves will kill hun­dreds of mil­lions, es­pe­cially in Europe, North Amer­ica and Asia. More­over, the com­plex feed­back ef­fects of a warmer planet are un­think­able. We are on the precipice of Ar­maged­don. We must give up our ad­dic­tion to car­bon. This 21st Con­fer­ence of Par­ties must be dif­fer­ent. We all must act, in­di­vid­u­ally and col­lec­tively, to re­store our planet to the path of sus­tain­able growth. Our ad­dic­tion to car­bon has pushed the planet to a calami­tous tip­ping point. What is wrong with us? Per­haps the threat of cat­a­strophic cli­mate change is not im­me­di­ate or con­crete. I think The Day Af­ter Tomorrow is here! What is stop­ping in­di­vid­u­als, na­tions and the global com­mu­nity from act­ing with fierce ur­gency to re­deem the world from a path of im­mi­nent peril? A green growth path, with low to zero car­bon emis­sion, is no longer an op­tion.",津巴布韦
zw,Chronicle (Zimbabwe),20170815,Re­liv­ing the Bat­tle of Chin­hoyi,"On April 28, 1966, seven Zanla free­dom fight­ers per­ished at the hands of Rhode­sian forces af­ter a fierce bat­tle that lasted a day on the banks of Manyame River, a few kilo­me­tres from Chin­hoyi. The Rhode­sians had de­scended on the town af­ter word spread that guer­ril­las were plan­ning acts of sab­o­tage. Although oral ac­counts of what tran­spired prior to that bat­tle vary, it is gen­er­ally be­lieved the seven fight­ers were part of a 21-mem­ber group that sneaked into Zim­babwe from Zam­bia. Their task was to un­der­take sev­eral sab­o­tage acts that would co­in­cide with the 68th an­niver­sary of the death of Mbuya Ne­handa, the spirit medium of Charwe killed by set­tler forces on April 27, 1898. All 21 fight­ers had re­ceived mil­i­tary train­ing in Nank­ing, China. The brief­ing from Cde Her­bert Chitepo, the then Zanu Chair­man in Lusaka, Zam­bia, was to tar­get strate­gic sites big enough to desta­bilise the Rhode­sian es­tab­lish­ment and send it into panic. The guer­ril­las were sup­posed to split into four groups on reach­ing Chin­hoyi’s pe­riph­ery. Some sur­viv­ing mem­bers of the larger group re­count how Cdes Mud­hu­meni Nyikadzino Chivende and Alex Nharara were the fa­mous seven’s first con­tacts. Both are now late. The fight­ers briefed the two on their mis­sion and for close to a month, the pair was their only link with the wider Chin­hoyi com­mu­nity and the only ones aware of their hide­out. The main tar­get was the Kariba Hy­dro Power Station py­lon that sup­plied elec­tric­ity to Rhode­sia. Had it been hit, the en­tire coun­try would have been plunged into dark­ness. How­ever, things did not go ac­cord­ing to plan as the dam­age only caused a mi­nor black­out in Chin­hoyi. Dis­il­lu­sioned by this set­back, the com­rades con­sulted spirit medi­ums who gave them the green light to ex­e­cute their mis­sion, as­sur­ing them that all was well. Plans to carry out more sab­o­tage also went hor­ri­bly wrong as one group that had split from the main one en­coun­tered skir­mishes in Chegutu, re­sult­ing in the death of a white com­mer­cial farmer. This was not ac­cord­ing to the orig­i­nal plan. The orig­i­nal plan was to in­flict as much dam­age on the elec­tric­ity line so as to cause a na­tion­wide black­out that would have been a sig­nal to other groups en­ter­ing the coun­try through Mu­toko, Nyanga and Mutare. The death of the white farmer caused alarm among the Rhode­sians, and the seven fight­ers’ sit­u­a­tion was com­pounded by one of their con­tacts who sold them out. Spurred by su­pe­rior weaponry, the Rhode­sian forces de­scended on Manyame River, the guer­ril­las’ ren­dezvous just 4km from Chin­hoyi, and started shelling, aided by bombers and jet fight­ers. The bat­tle be­gan at 9AM, end­ing at around 4PM, when the free­dom fight­ers ran out of am­mu­ni­tion. The seven guer­ril­las fought to the last bul­let, re­fus­ing to sur­ren­der. White sol­diers col­lected sev­eral sou­venirs from the bat­tle site, mark­ing their first com­bat against an or­gan­ised in­sur­gency. How­ever, the ac­tual site where the bod­ies of the seven com­rades were buried re­mains a mys­tery. Some Chin­hoyi res­i­dents say their re­mains were buried close to Manyame River at what is now known as Magamba Ceme­tery. Other ac­counts have it that the re­mains were in­cin­er­ated to erase that piece of his­tory; while an­other ver­sion says the bod­ies were thrown in dis­used mine shafts. Sadly, the ac­tual burial site is slowly fad­ing into a his­tor­i­cal myth, with no real at­tempt at ver­i­fi­ca­tion. Yet, the con­tri­bu­tion of these seven he­roes of the Sec­ond Chimurenga is well known. The Chin­hoyi Bat­tle taught lat­ter com­bat­ants to use bet­ter tac­tics. Although the seven he­roes lost their lives, their re­fusal to sur­ren­der still evokes a sense of pride. There were also wild cel­e­bra­tions among na­tion­al­ists in­car­cer­ated in dif­fer­ent prisons and de­ten­tion cen­tres when news of the bat­tle fil­tered through. Thirty-six years into In­de­pen­dence, those he­roes’ burial site is still un­marked, un­claimed and yearn­ing for recog­ni­tion. David Guzuzu’s mother, who was pro­filed by The Pa­triot news­pa­per at some point, still de­sires to see the re­mains of her son who she, five years af­ter the war, still be­lieved was alive un­til she met a war vet­eran in her vil­lage who had a list of those who fought in the fa­mous Chin­hoyi Bat­tle. “I was shocked when a man I met at the Ma­gaya shops showed me a paper with the seven guer­ril­las. My son’s name was third on the list. I col­lapsed. “The pain was too much. Sammy (David’s birth name), my sec­ond born son, left home be­cause of poverty and died in the Chin­hoyi Bat­tle,” Am­buya Sophia Ching­wara said.",津巴布韦
